STONE AGE ECONOMICS


“Sahlins’ forays into economic anthropology are full of interest.”

Cyril S. Belshaw, American Anthropologist

“Stone Age Economics, while not a survey of the economic anthropology,
is as of now the most sophisticated, extensive presentation, and
argument in and about, the field.”

Walter C. Neale, Science

“This book is subversive to so many of the fundamental assumptions of
Western technological society that it is a wonder it was permitted to be
published. ... Professor Sahlins directly challenges the idea that
Western civilization has provided greater ‘leisure’ or ‘affluence,’ or
even greater reliability, than ‘primitive’ hunter-gatherers.”

Whole Earth Review

“His book is rich in factual evidence and in ideas, so rich that a brief
review cannot do it justice; only another book could do that.”

E. Evans-Pritchard, Times Literary Supplement

Since its first publication over forty years ago Marshall Sahlins’ Stone
Age Economics has established itself as a classic of modern anthropology
and arguably one of the founding works of anthropological economics.
Ambitiously tackling the nature of economic life and how to study it
comparatively, Sahlins radically revises traditional views of the
hunter-gatherer and so-called primitive societies, revealing them to be
the original “affluent society.”

Sahlins examines notions of production, distribution, and exchange in
early communities and examines the link between economics and cultural
and social factors. A detailed study of tribal economies, domestic
production for livelihood, and of the submission of domestic production
to the material and political demands of society at large, Stone Age
Economics regards the economy as a category of culture rather than
behavior, in a class with politics and religion rather than rationality
or prudence. Sahlins concludes, controversially, that the lives of those
living in subsistence economies may actually have been better,
healthier, and more fulfilled than the millions enjoying the affluence
and luxury afforded by the economics of modern industrialization and
agriculture.

This Routledge Classics edition includes a new foreword by David
Graeber, London School of Economics.

Marshall Sahlins is Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor
Emeritus of Anthropology and of Social Sciences at the University of
Chicago.

FOREWORD TO THE ROUTLEDGE CLASSICS EDITION


Back when I was an evolutionary anthropologist, I learned that the most
successful species are those which remain the most generalized. If I
hadn’t learned that I would probably still be an evolutionary
anthropologist.

—Marshall Sahlins

I would like to use the occasion of this foreword to call for Marshall
Sahlins to be nominated for a Nobel Prize in Economics.

Surely if Bob Dylan merits a Nobel in literature, the author of Stone
Age Economics, and of so many other works that have fundamentally
changed our conceptions of the very nature and purposes of economic
life, would be a worthy candidate for the prize in economics. The essays
assembled in this volume have had a profound impact on any number of
academic disciplines—the notion of the three circles of reciprocity
developed in “On the Sociology of Primitive Exchange” alone has been
adopted by archaeologists, historians, classicists, literary theorists,
political theorists, psychologists, art historians, sociologists,
philosophers, and students of religion. Perhaps the only discipline that
has never made significant use of the theoretical tools provided in this
collection is economics itself. But then, economists have a long history
of rejecting any terms other than their own, convinced they are engaged
in something akin to natural science with unique insight into human
rationality (that is, they have come to believe that, perhaps alone
among the social sciences, they really are scientists, and
simultaneously, that they study that domain of human life where people
themselves behave most scientifically), they evince a notorious
disinterest in theoretical tools developed by anybody else. Economics is
perhaps the most insular, the most self-enclosing of disciplines. Which
is why it is the most in need of a jolt from the outside.

Granted, history itself has recently dealt economics some jolts of its
own. The crash of 2008 might, historically, come to be seen as something
of a turning point. Economics had acquired such unprecedented prestige
in the 1980s and 1990s that it was being treated like a kind of master
discipline, to the point where anyone considered fit to run anything
significant, even a university or charity, was expected to have at least
some training in it. But this prestige was largely based on having
convinced the world that economics, as a discipline, had itself been
responsible for creating a genuinely efficient, rational,
self-sustaining global system. Then of course, it all blew up. The fact
that virtually every major economist was taken entirely by surprise when
it did so (about the only exceptions were a few oddballs, Marxists,
Minskyians, and the like, scoffed at by the rest of the discipline),
left many asking: What is it that economists are really good for? What
is it they actually do? What purpose is really served by the existence
of the discipline?

Surprisingly, perhaps, the most aggressive questions were raised by
students in economics departments around the world, who began organizing
a global movement to change the way the discipline was taught: as a
field of competing paradigms and theories like any other social
scientific discipline, rather than as a uniform body of received Truth.

* * *

This is what makes the reissuing of this volume, and its recognition, so
appropriate to the historical moment. I would like to see it considered
as part of the core curriculum for the reformed discipline of economics.

Marshall Sahlins himself is a representative of one grand tradition in
anthropology—perhaps the very grandest—that of the activist
intellectual, engaged with social movements, but at the same time whose
anthropological writings are if anything even more politically
important, because they are aimed at having an impact on popular
understandings of social, domestic, political, and economic
possibilities. We might call this the anthropology of liberation,
because the role of such anthropologists has always been to liberate
their readers from some mind-forged manacles that they didn’t even know
were there. Each places a small chisel of reality to an otherwise
impregnable-seeming wall of bogus economic common sense, one which
causes us to believe, often in some very subtle way, that human beings
have always been calculating bourgeois individuals, or else, have always
wanted to be that, but just haven’t fully worked out the technical
means. Marcel Mauss, active in the cooperativist movement (for many
years he actually helped manage a cooperative bakery in Paris), was the
first to effectively challenge the myth that economic life “emerged from
barter”: that is, that people invented money because they were already
engaged in market behavior, but hadn’t yet developed the appropriate
technology. In the process, he ensured that words like “potlatch” and
“gift economy” would became familiar terms to anyone involved in
revolutionary or artistic movements ever since. Marshall Sahlins, who
among his other claims to fame was the inventor of the 1960s campus
teach-in, did one better than Mauss with “The Original Affluent
Society”—an essay which, appropriately enough, first appeared in
Sartre’s journal Temps Moderne in Paris in 1968—taking on the very idea
that there has ever been such a thing as “economic progress.”¹ Our
assumption that humanity began, effectively, as slaves to their material
conditions, locked in a desperate struggle for survival, and that
science and resulting technological progress has been a gradual and
inevitable process of liberation from material necessity, was itself
based on ignoring the scientific evidence. Life in the
Paleolithic—which, after all, is at least 90 percent of human
history—was in no sense a struggle for existence. In fact, for most of
our history, humans have lived a life of great material abundance. This
is because “abundance” is not an absolute measure; it means when you
have easy access to large amounts of the things that you want or think
you need. In relation to their needs, most hunter-gatherers are rich.
Most of all, their hours of labour would be the envy of any modern
wage-slave of today.

Coming from a former evolutionary anthropologist and well-known
political progressive, this apparent rejection of the very idea of
social progress was a startling revelation indeed. It shattered, with a
single blow, a dozen assumptions at once about what had actually
happened over the course of human history, and by extension, the very
purpose of technological advances. As a result, that one essay has
probably had more impact on the popular imagination than any single work
of anthropology before or since. It was embraced by everyone from
hippies and socialists to an endless variety of modern-day luddites.
Whole schools of political thought (Primitivism, Degrowth. . .) would
never have come into existence were it not for Sahlins’ intervention.
The essay has been debated in reading groups in squats in Croatia and
alternative academies in Korea and Japan. The Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski,
has devoted a good deal of his time in prison to writing an extensive
critique.

It’s an essay that has genuinely changed the course of human history— if
only, mainly, so far, history that has already taken place.

* * *

It’s important to understand “The Original Affluent Society” and the
other essays collected in Stone Age Economics—generally consider ed to
mark Sahlins’ “Substantivist phase”—in the larger intellectual context
from which they emerged. Sahlins had studied at Columbia University in
the 1950s, and as a second and third year graduate student sat in on the
famous seminars by exiled Viennese-Hungarian economic historian Karl
Polanyi, held in his New York apartment and attended by such brilliant
figures as the Classicist Moses Finley and Assyriologist Leo Oppenheim.
Polanyi at the time was leading a direct challenge to the economic
orthodoxy of the day, arguing that the very notion that there is
something called “the economy” is a relatively recent historical
development, and even more radically, that rather than emerging as some
sort of spontaneous process from below, European markets had actually
been nurtured and fostered by self-conscious government policy. Rather
than there being a natural opposition, even war, between state and
market—as all liberal thought had assumed since at least the time of the
French Revolution, and certainly, since the Russian one—the market in
its contemporary sense was largely the creation of the state. Much of
Polanyi’s work at Columbia was aimed at mapping out historical
alternatives, understanding how sharing, gift, and redistributive
economies had operated in the past. Sahlins himself contributed to this
effort with an unpublished paper on Polynesia, which apparently was left
aside when the editors decided to focus the resultant book on “Trade and
Market in the Early Empires.”

It’s important to remember that at the time, such ideas, and the people
who espoused them, were considered genuinely dangerous. Polanyi himself
was at the time forced to commute back and forth weekly from Montreal to
New York, since his wife, a former member of the Hungarian Communist
Youth League, had been denied entrance to the United States. Finley was
eventually blacklisted, fired from his job at Rutgers for refusing to
testify against his students, and driven into exile. Other student
participants in the seminar met similar fates.

Writing in retrospect, one might say that Polanyi was one of the few
thinkers active in his day who had a full sense of just how grandiose
the intellectual and political ambitions of the economic discipline
might turn out to be—and what a catastrophe it would be if they
succeeded. Hence his primary target was always what he called
“economism”— the assumption that the particular form that economic
activity tends to take in contemporary societies (market calculation) is
always identical to its substance, that is, the means by which human
societies organize their material provisioning, supply themselves with
what they need, and organize the distribution of luxuries. Confusing
form and substance could only lead to “identifying market and society”
and, ultimately, the assumption that all human behavior could be
explained in market terms. The result Polanyi predicted would be deeply
perverse and politically disastrous: since it would imply that cold,
calculating greed was the only “rational” (hence, acceptable) human
motive. In this Polanyi was indeed a prophet. This is exactly what has
happened since.

But his attempt to nip the danger in the bud met sharp resistance.
Mainstream economic anthropologists of the time largely rejected his
conclusions, taking up the title “Formalist” as a badge of honor and
insisting that markets do indeed simply expose the workings of a
universal form of rational calculation. Homo they argued, is always, to
some extent at least, Oeconomicus. He has to be. (In this context it’s
legitimate to say “he.” They really didn’t have women in mind here.)
This is because humans everywhere are always confronted with scarce
resources of some sort, and always therefore have to decide on the most
efficient ways to deploy those resources in order to get what they want.
Extreme formalists like Harold Schneider even took Polanyi’s more dire
predictions to heart, suggesting economic logic could be applied to all
human action (presumably, up to and including academic debate, where
Schneider’s own decision whether or not to falsify his data or simply
shoot those who disagreed with him would simply be one of calculated
expedience), likening Formalism to Edmund Leach’s then-fashionable
structuralism: the Formalists were the trend-setting engineers in search
of the deep principles that lay behind social systems, and the
Substantivists the equivalent of old fuddy-duddy “butterfly collectors”
of the Radcliffe-Brownian variety, content to simply sort societies into
types (Tribal Economy, Redistributive Economy, Market Economy, etc.).

Sahlins has never been one to shirk from intellectual combat and most of
the essays assembled in this volume were written, in one way or another,
in response to such Formalist positions. The “Original Affluent Society”
was, of course, a direct challenge to the very notion of “scarce
resources.” Scarcity, after all, exists only in relation to felt need.
It is hard to find a snow-plow in Brazil, but you can’t really speak of
a scarcity of them, any more than you can say public spaces in
California suffer from a scarcity of spittoons or the International
Space Station is lacking in fishing equipment. This might seem
self-evident, but it’s the kind of self-evident truth whose implications
most people never seriously consider. Sahlins has spent much of his
intellectual life working out the implications. How, he has effectively
asked, is it we come to define our world around what we think it lacks,
around the degree to which we find it inadequate to the fulfillment of
our material desires? Once framed that way there is only one possible
answer: there is something wrong with our desires, or at least what we
believe our desires to be. (This is actually a further complicating
factor: in much of history, even when most people were convinced humans
were incorrigible creatures, very few actually acted that way.) Why did
we come to abandon Paleolithic affluence and actually create a world in
which most of us actually do live lives of scarcity?

In his long two-part essay on “The Domestic Mode of Production”— the
closest Sahlins ever came to an experiment with Marxist models—he offers
one tentative solution. Perhaps the answer lies in the social
organization of production. For most of human history, the primary unit
of production has been the household. And as Soviet economist Alexander
Chayanov had elaborately demonstrated, a peasant household will tend to
deploy its labor in such a way as to guarantee what its members consider
to be a decent standard of life for all their members (e.g., sufficient
food, enough left over for feasts and weddings, perhaps support for the
occasional wandering holy man or entertainer. . .); in doing so they
will tend to distribute tasks within the household more by a sense of
equity than efficiency, but, crucially, once they had attained that
minimally decent level, they would mainly stop working and spend their
time enjoying themselves. Sahlins assembled a great deal of evidence to
demonstrate that what Chayanov found to be true of prerevolutionary
Russian peasants was largely true of any society in which labor was
organized by household needs: there was thus a direct line between
hunter-gatherer affluence, the behavior of Medieval serfs, and, for
instance, the fact that it’s so difficult to get a taxi in the rain
(since drivers, who are generally working for a daily target income,
tend to work until they reach it and then go home.)

This meant that the human proclivity to prefer leisure to greater wealth
lasted a very long time. What then led us (or so many of us) to change
our minds? Within the domestic mode of production, the only pressures to
increase output were, typically, political: big men, chiefs, and
would-be potentates invariably wanted more, since unlike the
householders, they were competitive individuals, constantly vying to
outdo each other in magnificence or war. Still, in the absence of state
power, there was a decided limit on how much such men could extract.
Householders quickly developed standards for what was a reasonable level
of depredation as well. Sahlins ends by noting that in Hawaii, if rulers
were considered to have gone beyond such reasonable levels of
depredation, they would simply be killed. It was only with the rise of
the state that this became impossible.

All of this was, of course, being argued and debated at the height of
the Vietnam War, during which a guerrilla army of peasant householders,
moved largely by such moral outrage, appeared to be fighting the
greatest state military machine in human history to a standstill. But
the fate of Chayanov—who was ultimately purged and shot under Stalin for
unorthodox views on farm collectivization—threw Sahlins’ view of the
state as villain into a more ambivalent light. If it is a human
inclination, under ordinary circumstances, to prefer leisure over
increased production, and if history was a battle between those who
wished to maximize production and those who wished to enjoy less
ostentatious luxuries, what side was the Left actually on?

It is a testament to the power of Sahlins’ work that he managed to raise
these questions, not as abstract questions of philosophy, not from the
inside, as it were, but from the outside, starting from the concrete
variety of actual human material experience. As a result, his
interventions were generally the most enduring. Few remember “The
Domestic Mode of Production” nowadays, but everyone still argues about
the issues that it raised.

“On the Sociology of Primitive Exchange,” which first appeared in 1965,
might be said to be Sahlins’ riposte to the charge that Substantivists
were butterfly-collectors, as well as being his first attempt to grapple
with Structuralism. Both Karl Polanyi and Claude Levi-Strauss had
proposed tripartite divisions of types of exchange. Polanyi’s
distinction was between societies based on reciprocity, redistribution,
and market; Levi-Strauss made the argument that all societies were, in
their essence, made up of three levels of exchange: of goods
(economics); of women (kinship); and words (language)—this being his own
variation of the then-popular Marxist distinction of economic
infrastructure, intermediary social structure, and ideological
superstructure.

Both formulations had their problems. Polanyi’s was crude, and opened
itself to charges of taking differences of emphasis between cultures and
essentializing them as differences in kind. (After Immanuel Wallerstein
adopted a variation of Polanyi’s tripartite division for his
world-systems theory, Andre Gunder-Frank objected that all he was really
doing was talking about family, government, and trade. Any moderately
complex society should be expected to combine all three. So we were back
to levels once again.) Levi-Strauss’ division had a different problem:
it was self-evidently absurd. The idea that marriage is always
necessarily an exchange between women and men is based on an argument
that matrilocal systems don’t really exist, which is clearly not the
case, and there is almost no sense in which the “exchange” of words in
speech resembles the trading of goods. It was metaphor run amok,
disguised as science. The fact that this argument was taken seriously,
and even used as the basis of analysis, by so many French thinkers of
the time, is more a reflection of the intellectual awe in which
Levi-Strauss was then held, not to mention his enormous institutional
power (and secondarily, too, the rival power of very simplistic forms of
Marxism then being inflicted on the intellectual Left by the French
Communist Party, against whom Levi-Strauss was the great
standard-bearer).

In a remarkable feat of synthesis, Sahlins took these jangly and
conflicted notions and fused them together into something that actually
made sense. Yes, he agreed, Marcel Mauss had been right to argue that
all possibilities always coexist inside any society, and yes
Levi-Strauss was right to criticize Mauss for not acknowledging that
reciprocity was the basis of all social relations. But Levi-Strauss was
mistaken in trying to solve the problem by appealing to a quasi-Marxist
notion of levels. Really what we need to examine is how the social
universe looks from any particular individual perspective within it.
Everything depends on social distance, hence the famous division
between: Generalized Reciprocity (basically, what Mauss called
“communism”) between close kin, or people who one treats as if they were
close kin; a kind of middle zone of Balanced Reciprocity governed by
fairness, whether in the exchange of sisters or the tit-for-tat murders
of the blood-feud; and finally, Negative Reciprocity, which actually
means those so beyond the pale that rules of reciprocity simply do not
apply.² While certainly imperfect (Sahlins has since partly abandoned
it), this idea of concentric moral circles of sociability has been
endlessly productive, having been cited and deployed by scholars working
in almost every discipline (again, except mainstream economics), and
surely represents one of the most powerful new forms of economic
analysis to emerge from the middle third of the twentieth century. (And
in the last third, there was very little new.)

***

Sahlins spent the years 1967–8 in Paris as a guest of Levi-Strauss, and
his essay on the hau could be seen as marking his first confrontation
with the (at first quite alien) concerns and issues of French
intellectual life. Witness to the events at the Sorbonne during the
uprising of May 1968, Sahlins’ subsequent work, especially his
denunciation of Marx as simply another embodiment of bourgeois economism
in Culture and Practical Reason (1976), might be seen as, as much as
anything, a reflection of the widespread revulsion in radical circles
about the cynically calculating behavior of the French Communist Party
at the time. And while his subsequent, cosmological turn is often seen
as representing a fundamental break with the kind of concerns which
dominate the essays in this volume, it really isn’t. Sahlins continues
to ask the same fundamental questions. Why do we see the world as
inadequate to what we want out of it? If it’s not just the effect of
self-aggrandizing state elites, might it not be something deeper, a
fundamental flaw in Western conceptions of what humans are and their
relations to the rest of the cosmos? In “The Sadness of Sweetness”
(1996), he traced the problem back to Augustine’s conception of original
sin. Human beings are cursed with disobedient and insatiable desires in
punishment for their own disobedience to God. In The Western Illusion of
Human Nature (2008) he pushes it back further, to the Sophists. Needless
to say, most of these interventions have set off furious debates. This
is exactly how they were intended. And we have every reason to expect
more unexpected revelations in the future.

***

To a large degree, mainstream economics is still trying to solve
nineteenth century problems: how to increase overall productivity and
assure an efficient distribution of necessities under conditions of
overall scarcity. It’s clear that, if our species is to survive, we’re
going to have to come up with a new economic discipline which starts
from very different questions (for instance, how to assure access to the
means of life under conditions of rapidly growing productivity and
decreasing demand for labor, without also destroying Earth). Everything
must be re-imagined. These are exactly the conditions under which it’s
important to turn to the past—not just our intellectual history but,
above all, human history, the endless treasury of human creativity and
experiment that only anthropology can unlock—to liberate us from
preconceptions, and set us on the road to truly new ideas. There is
perhaps no single work of anthropology that so lends itself to this task
as Stone Age Economics. It is certainly one of the books that made me
decide to become an anthropologist. I hope the reader finds it as
inspirational as I did.

PREFACE TO NEW EDITION


Like other anthropological subspecies of its kind, each having to do
with a distinct subdivision of a cultural order—political anthropology,
legal anthropology, medical anthropology, etc.—the field of economic
anthropology has changed almost beyond recognition since the appearance
of Stone Age Economics in 1972. So many and diverse are these changes,
it would require another book rather than a new preface to reflect upon
them; hence I confine myself here to certain issues and societies of the
kind that were central to the original edition. In this connection the
changes in the subdiscipline have seemingly been negative, if not fatal,
as witness to the fact that general university courses offered under the
title “Economic Anthropology” are becoming increasingly quaint and
correspondingly rare. Something similar could be said for “Political
Anthropology” and “Legal Anthropology,” and for similar reasons. Not
that the interest in the many social varieties of material or political
life has slackened, so much as what had been confidently called “the
economy” or “the political system” is being rethought as “the culture.”
Rather than a separate sphere of existence, economic activity is
perceived as encompassed in cultural order. Hence it needs to be
understood in the relative terms of a given mode of human existence: as
the expression, in a material register, of the values and relations of a
particular form of life. Here is “the economic” as a function rather
than a structure—let alone the all-determining infrastructure. So
Stephen Gudeman, Richard Wilk, and other leading scholars of the old
school are bringing us into a new era of “cultural economics.” I would
like to think of Stone Age Economics as an early contribution to that
desirable end.

Although it cannot be claimed even now that the revolution has been
accomplished, the three decades since the first edition of this book
have been witness to many worldly and intellectual realizations of the
cultural constitution of material practice. Paradoxically, something
good to that effect came out of the perverse role attributed to
“culture” in undoing the best laid plans of modernization and economic
development experts. As the saying goes, developing countries, with
American help, never develop. Almost always the usual suspect is the
local “culture.” The people’s culture is what’s the matter with them: an
“impediment” to (bourgeois) economic rationality and progress—thus to
becoming happy and good, just like us. (The alternative, rarely
contemplated except by the local people, would be to define economic
development as the material security and enrichment of their own way of
life.) But then, economic anthropology had its own built-in
ethnocentrism, likewise amounting to a structural contradiction, as it
insisted on analytically separating out “the economy” in societies where
there was none. In traditional Fiji or Tierra del Fuego there was no
differentiated, self-regulating economic domain: no purely pragmatic
sphere of relationships on the (ideal-typical) model of the
capitalist-market system. By supposing more or less by definition that
there was such a thing, economic anthropology was burdened from the
beginning with an ethnographic category mistake. But the real
imperialism that involved imposing our cultural system on Fijians and
others proved to be bad enough; we need not duplicate it in the form of
anthropological theory.

The traditional economic terms of Fijians were not what our economic
science would recognize as such. Their economic terms were “chiefs” (the
recipients of tributes and dispensers of largesse), “sister’s son” (a
specially privileged relative), “be of good heart my kinsmen” (a
near-imperative solicitation of material help), “sea people”
(specialized clans of fishers and sailors), “whale teeth” (the
preeminent valuables), “border allies” (contracted by gifts), “war god”
(subject of lavish offerings), etc. Such were the famous relations of
production, distribution, and consumption, organizing the exploitation
of nature and the provisioning of society according to the meaningful
values of persons and the objects of their existence. By this cultural
praxis, the material forces and circumstances were given specifically
Fijian effects. How to understand the division of labor by sex in the
coastal regions of the Fiji Islands—a significant aspect of the
relations of production? Start with the symbolic proportion that men are
to women as sea is to land and exterior to interior. In local terms, it
follows that the farming of the bush and the fishing of the deep sea are
men’s work; the gathering (as of firewood) around the village and
netting fish in the lagoon are women’s domains. If I had the space and
readers the patience, it could be shown that the values thus organizing
production were encoded throughout the culture, from cosmogonic myths to
the rituals of kingship and the structures of domestic space. Production
is an onto-logic of people, places, and things that brings to bear the
entire cultural scheme on the most elementary material activities. Yet
the distinctively Fijian organization of their islands is hardly the
only one possible. And however prudently Fijians as individuals operate
with the values of their cultural scheme, it can hardly be argued that
their values—the superiority of the sea, the divinity of the chief, the
rights of the sister’s son to his maternal uncle’s goods, the material
benefits from providing and consuming human sacrifices—that their values
themselves represent a maximization of the material utilities.
Rationality operates within a relative cultural order which for its part
has its own reasons.

Still at the present moment, marked by the triumphant global advance of
neoliberal ideology, the understandings of a “cultural economics,” like
the cultural understandings of the peoples concerned, have to make
headway against the strong counterclaims of pecuniary utility and market
rationality. There seems to be a growing neo-Durkheimian agreement in
the academy, including many anthropologists who ought to know better, to
perceive the traditional non-Western economies as some hybrid mixture of
individual rationality on the one hand and socio-cultural order on the
other. Human beings are double and divided, said Durkheim, composed of
the egocentric desires inherent in their own nature and the moral
constraints they derive from society. (Society as the diffuse
suppression of the libidinous subject: you can see where Foucault and
Freud were coming from.) In the same way, economic life is too often
understood as a contest between self-satisfaction and social constraint,
or in other words, economizing within the local rules of the game. The
explanation has the advantage of being fairly foolproof, since the
economically rational and the cultural cum irrational are contradictory,
so that in some combination or other they can explain anything and
everything. If you’re not maximizing material utility, you must be
satisfying some other, purely social value. The problematic even has the
added advantage of presenting its self-contradictions in the persuasive
form of tautologies.

But the modern consensus integrating the cultural and the rational only
appears to do so. In practice, the cultural order is subsumed in
practical rationality inasmuch as everything is reduced to the
bourgeois-like strategizing of self-interested subjects—the cultural
conditions only coming into the account in the traduced form of personal
satisfactions. The hybrid problematic has been in trouble from the
beginning because of its attachment to solipsisms of ancient memory. It
wants to define the economic object of study—in its origins, materials,
and institutional forms, a thoroughly social phenomenon, and accordingly
social in its individual expressions—from the thoroughly bourgeois
standpoint of how individuals go about acquiring and disposing of the
material means of their personal existence. How then to involve the
culture in the rational allocation of scarce means against alternative
ends so as to derive the greatest possible satisfactions? The problem is
that the rational and the cultural belong to incommensurable orders of
discourse: the one a practical calculus of individual action, the other
referring to social forms such as matrilineal clans, ritual obligations,
relations of hierarchy, of family, of devotion, or whatever is
organizing the provisioning of the society. The only way they can be
brought together under the description of rational action is to
translate the cultural conditions into so many desires and preferences
of the self-satisfying subject. The cultural thus disappears as such, in
its attributes of matrilineal descent or chiefly dues, to reappear as
motives in the possession of the individual, as though he or she were
their author as well as their master.

Indeed this mode of intellectual production would be good for any
cultural content. The Trobriander who gives away half his yam harvest to
his sister’s husband and counts on receiving half the crop of his wife’s
brother is acting prudently under the circumstances, inasmuch as he
would be worse off socially if he did otherwise, even as he is doing
well for himself by acquiring a certain moral esteem at no great
material expense. Thus does the specific form of matrilineal affiliation
in the Trobriands reappear as a universal disposition of rational
choice. True, Trobriand culture gets lost in the translation, but in
compensation the economizing formula will work just as well for the
Fijian chief who allows himself to be pillaged of European trade goods
by his uterine nephew, the Hawaiian chief who hoards up foreign goods to
the point of conspicuous waste, or the Kwakiutl chief who distributes
such stuff as generously as possible. All are acting with an eye to
their own advantage under the cultural circumstances. The only
difference among them is the cultural circumstances—and accordingly the
several economic outcomes. But the several cultural logics that would
have to be examined to account for these outcomes have already been
assumed and mystified as the subjective dispositions of the rational
actors. Thus is the anthropology of it all recuperated by a classic
economism—that had always considered culture to be an “exogenous factor”
in any case. For too long, economic science has been getting away with
categorizing the cultural forms that order the economy as
“non-economic.”

Anyhow the sclerotic opposition of economic rationality and culture, and
worse yet the aged conceit that the West functions freely on the basis
of the former while the Rest are in thrall to the latter, are
self-congratulatory mystifications—with the undeniable virtue of
upholding civilization and education as we know them. They are
mystifications not only because other peoples are prudent enough with
their material resources, but because our rationality is grounded in
equally relative and nonutilitarian schemes of cultural value. True, the
round-robin circulation of yam harvests in the Trobriand islands to no
net material change except the losses in time and energy would seem
irrational by our economic lights. But the so-called returns in social
values to one side, even in the strong utilitarian sense of realizing
material benefits from the expenditure of time and energy, the
Trobrianders (like everyone else) are surely acting advantageously all
things considered; for if their irrational culture had them running at a
net loss in such respects, they would not have lived to become the
prophets of such religion.

On the other hand, the commodification of everything in our (capitalist)
existence, requiring us to submit all that we do and want to a pecuniary
calculus, only disguises the fact that this material rationality is
dependent on a vast system of logico-meaningful attributes of things and
relationships of people. Much of this cultural order is indeed
subconscious, a matter of habitus: the way that shoppers in the
supermarket make (rational) choices between different meats, poultry, or
fish according to such criteria as the necessity of having something
“different” than last night’s dinner—“difference” being determined from
a complex typology of main dishes and forms of food preparation; or
again, the way one chooses to buy prime rib rather than spare ribs, or a
rack of lamb rather than hamburger, because tonight happens to be a
special occasion not an outdoor barbecue. It is not nutritional utility
either that associates certain cuts of beef with some social situations
and certain cuts of pork with others. It is the large (largely
unconsidered) code of motivated relationships between men and animals
prevailing among the Western natives. Nor would the material utilities
of clothing govern the differences in styles of dress that mark the
social distinctions between men and women, holidays and ordinary days,
businessmen and policemen, work and leisure, Farwesterners and
Middlewesterners, adults and teenagers, debutante balls and discos—think
of all the ways clothes signify. Granted that the producers are always
looking to invent new differentiations for their own profits; all the
more reason that they have to operate on the same cultural wavelengths
as the consumers.

In a different way but to the same effect as the material practices of
the Fijian or Trobriand Islanders, the capitalist system of pecuniary
rationality is the implementation of a larger system of cultural value.
In the West as in the Rest, rationality is an expression of the culture,
of its meaningful sysem of utilities, not the antithesis. To understand
our economy requires the same kind of anthropological sensibility we
bring to the study of others. We are one of the others.

Forget economic anthropology. We need a truly anthropological economics.

of my research and writing. In 1963–64 I held a fellowship at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (Palo Alto), in 1967–69 an
office and the run of the Laboratoire d’Anthropologie Sociale du Collège
de France (Paris). Although I had no official position in the
Laboratoire, M. Claude Lévi-Strauss, the director, received me with a
courtesy and generosity I should have difficulty reciprocating, were he
ever in turn to visit my village.

A John Simon Guggenheim fellowship during my first year in Paris
(1967–68) and a Social Science Research Council Faculty Research
Fellowship (1958–61) also contributed important support during the
gestation period of these essays.

That period has been so long and so full of beneficial intellectual
encounters that it would be impossible to list all the colleagues and
students who have, in one way or another, influenced the course of the
work. Out of long years of friendship and discussion, however, I make
three exceptions: Remo Guidieri, Elman Service, and Eric Wolf. Their
ideas and criticisms, always accompanied by encouragement, have been of
inestimable value to me and to my work.

Several of the essays have been published in whole, in part, or in
translation during the past several years. “The Original Affluent
Society” appeared in abbreviated form as “La première société
d’abondance” in Les Temps Modernes (No. 268, Oct. 1968, 641–80). The
first part of Chapter 4 was originally published as “The Spirit of the
Gift” in Echanges et communications (Jean Pouillon and P. Maranda, eds.,
The Hague: Mouton, 1969). The second part of Chapter 4 appeared as
“Philosophie politique de l’Essai sur le don,” in L’Homme (vol. 8[4],
1968, 5–17). “On the Sociology of Primitive Exchange” was published
first in The Relevance of Models for Social Anthropology (M. Banton,

“The Diplomacy of Primitive Trade,” initially published in Essays in
Economic Anthropology (June Helm, ed., Seattle: American Ethnological
Society, 1965), has been entirely revised for the present book.



INTRODUCTION


I have written the several essays of this volume at various times over
the past ten years. Some were written especially for the present
publication. All were conceived and are here assembled in the hope of an
anthropological economics, which is to say, in opposition to
businesslike interpretations of primitive economies and societies.
Inevitably the book inscribes itself in the current anthropological
controversy between “formalist” and “substantivist” practices of
economic theory.

Endemic to the science of Economics for over a century, the
formalist-substantivist debate seems nevertheless lacking in history,
for nothing much seems to have changed since Karl Marx defined the
fundamental issues in contraposition to Adam Smith (cf. Althusser et
al., 1966, vol. 2). Still, the latest incarnation in the form of
anthropology has shifted the emphasis of discussion. If the problem in
the beginning was the “naive anthropology” of Economics, today it is the
“naive economics” of Anthropology. “Formalism versus substantivism”
amounts to the following theoretical option: between the ready-made
models of orthodox Economics, especially the “micro-economics,” taken as
universally valid and applicable grosso modo to the primitive societies;
and the necessity—supposing this formalist position unfounded—of
developing a new analysis more appropriate to the historical societies
in question and to the intellectual history of Anthropology. Broadly
speaking, it is a choice between the perspective of Business, for the
formalist method must consider the primitive economies as underdeveloped
versions of our own, and a culturalist study that as a matter of
principle does honor to different societies for what they are.

No solution is in sight, no ground for the happy academic conclusion
that “the answer lies somewhere in between.” This book is substantivist.
It thus takes on a familiar structure, as provided by traditional
substantive categories. The first essays concern production: “The
Original Affluent Society” and “The Domestic Mode of Production.” (The
latter has been divided for convenience into two sections, Chapters 2
and 3, but these make up one continuous argument.) The chapters
following turn to distribution and exchange: “The Spirit of the Gift,”
“On the Sociology of Primitive Exchange,” “Exchange Value and the
Diplomacy of Primitive Trade.” But as the exposition is at the same time
an opposition, this sequence harbors also a more concealed strategy of
debate. The lead chapter accepts battle on formalist terms. “The
Original Affluent Society” does not challenge the common understanding
of “economy” as a relation between means and ends; it only denies that
hunters find any great disparity between the two. The following essays,
however, would definitively abandon this entrepreneurial and
individualist conception of the economic object. “Economy” becomes a
category of culture rather than behavior, in a class with politics or
religion rather than rationality or prudence: not the need-serving
activities of individuals, but the material life process of society.
Then, the final chapter returns to economic orthodoxy, but to its
problems, not to its problématique. The attempt in the end is to bring
the anthropological perspective to bear on the traditional work of
microeconomics, the explanation of exchange value.

In all this, the aim of the book remains modest: merely to perpetuate
the possibility of an anthropological economics by a few concrete
examples. In a recent issue of Current Anthropology, a spokesman of the
opposed position announced with no apparent regret the untimely demise
of substantive economics:

The wordage squandered in this debate does not add up to its
intellectual weight. From the beginning the substantivists (as
exemplified in the justly famous works of Polanyi and others) were
heroically muddled and in error. It is a tribute to the maturity of
economic anthropology that we have been able to find in what the error
consisted in the short space of six years. The paper ... written by Cook
(1966) when he was a graduate student neatly disposes of the
controversy.... Social science being the sort of enterprise [!] it is,
however, it is virtually impossible to down a poor, useless, or
obfuscating hypothesis, and I expect the next generation of creators of
high-level confusion will resurrect, in one guise or another, the
substantive view of the economy.

(Nash, 1967, p. 250)

How then to describe the present work, which is neither the second
coming nor otherwise bears the slightest trace of immortality? One can
only hope there has been some mistake. Perhaps, as with Mark Twain in a
similar case, the reports of the death of substantivism have been
grossly exaggerated.

In any event, I refrain from the attempt at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
in the form of methodological discussion. The recent literature of
“economic anthropology” is already overinflated with talk at this level.
And while many of the arguments seem models of good sense, the total
effect has been to confirm everyone in his original prejudice. (“He
who’s convinced against his will/Is of the same opinion still.”) Reason
has proven a poor arbiter. Meanwhile the audience to the debate is
rapidly declining, out of boredom, prompting even some of the main
participants to now declare themselves ready to go to work. That too is
the spirit of this book. Officially, as a participant in a discipline
that considers itself a science, I would rest the case on the essays
themselves, and on the belief they explain matters better than the
competing theoretical mode. Such is the traditional and the healthy
procedure: let all the flowers bloom, and we shall see which bear real
fruit.

But the official position is not, I confess, my deepest conviction. It
seems to me that this tissue of metaphors on the natural sciences
dressed up as “social science,” this anthropology, has shown as little
capacity for agreement on the empirical adequacy of a theory as on its
logical sufficiency. For unlike mathematics where “truth and the
interest of men oppose not each other,” as Hobbes said long ago, in
social science nothing is indisputable because social science “compareth
men and meddleth with their right and profit,” so that “as often as
reason is against a man, a man is against reason.” The decisive
differences between formalism and substantivism, as far as their
acceptance is at issue, if not so far as their truth, are ideological.
Embodying the wisdom of native bourgeois categories, formal economics
flourishes as ideology at home and ethnocentrism abroad. As against
substantivism, it draws great strength from its profound compatibility
with bourgeois society—which is not to deny, either, that the conflict
with substantivism can become a confrontation of (two) ideologies.

When the early physicists and astronomers, working in the shadow of
established ecclesiastic dogmas, commended themselves to God and
Sovereign, they knew what they were doing. The present work plays on the
same contradiction: not in the illusion that the dogmas will prove
flexible, but the gods just. The political-ideological differences
between formal and anthropological thought may well be ignored in the
writing, but that does not render them much less consequent to the
outcome. We are told substantivism is dead. Politically, at least for a
certain part of the world, it may be so; that flower was nipped in the
bud. It is also conceivable that bourgeois economics is doomed,
scheduled by history to share the fate of the society that nurtured it.
In either event, it is not for current anthropology to decide. We are at
least enough of a science to know that is the prerogative of society,
and of the academic sons of heaven who hold its mandate. In the
meantime, we cultivate our gardens, waiting to see if the gods will
shower rain or, like those of certain New Guinea tribes, just urinate
upon us.



1 THE ORIGINAL AFFLUENT SOCIETY


If economics is the dismal science, the study of hunting and gathering
economies must be its most advanced branch. Almost universally committed
to the proposition that life was hard in the paleolithic, our textbooks
compete to convey a sense of impending doom, leaving one to wonder not
only how hunters managed to live, but whether, after all, this was
living? The specter of starvation stalks the stalker through these
pages. His technical incompetence is said to enjoin continuous work just
to survive, affording him neither respite nor surplus, hence not even
the “leisure” to “build culture.” Even so, for all his efforts, the
hunter pulls the lowest grades in thermodynamics—less energy/capita/year
than any other mode of production. And in treatises on economic
development he is condemned to play the role of bad example: the
so-called “subsistence economy.”

The traditional wisdom is always refractory. One is forced to oppose it
polemically, to phrase the necessary revisions dialectically: in fact,
this was, when you come to examine it, the original affluent society.
Paradoxical, that phrasing leads to another useful and unexpected
conclusion. By the common understanding, an affluent society is one in
which all the people’s material wants are easily satisfied. To assert
that the hunters are affluent is to deny then that the human condition
is an ordained tragedy, with man the prisoner at hard labor of a
perpetual disparity between his unlimited wants and his insufficient
means.

For there are two possible courses to affluence. Wants may be “easily
satisfied” either by producing much or desiring little. The familiar
conception, the Galbraithean way, makes assumptions peculiarly
appropriate to market economies: that man’s wants are great, not to say
infinite, whereas his means are limited, although improvable: thus, the
gap between means and ends can be narrowed by industrial productivity,
at least to the point that “urgent goods” become plentiful. But there is
also a Zen road to affluence, departing from premises somewhat different
from our own: that human material wants are finite and few, and
technical means unchanging but on the whole adequate. Adopting the Zen
strategy, a people can enjoy an unparalleled material plenty—with a low
standard of living.

That, I think, describes the hunters. And it helps explain some of their
more curious economic behavior: their “prodigality” for example— the
inclination to consume at once all stocks on hand, as if they had it
made. Free from market obsessions of scarcity, hunters’ economic
propensities may be more consistently predicated on abundance than our
own. Destutt de Tracy, “fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire” though he
might have been, at least compelled Marx’s agreement on the observation
that “in poor nations the people are comfortable,” whereas in rich
nations “they are generally poor.”

This is not to deny that a preagricultural economy operates under
serious constraints, but only to insist, on the evidence from modern
hunters and gatherers, that a successful accomodation is usually made.
After taking up the evidence, I shall return in the end to the real
difficulties of hunting-gathering economy, none of which are correctly
specified in current formulas of paleolithic poverty.


Sources of the Misconception

“Mere subsistence economy” “limited leisure save in exceptional
circumstances,” “incessant quest for food,” “meagre and relatively
unreliable” natural resources, “absence of an economic surplus,”
“maximum energy from a maximum number of people”—so runs the fair
average anthropological opinion of hunting and gathering.

The aboriginal Australians are a classic example of a people whose
economic resources are of the scantiest. In many places their habitat is
even more severe than that of the Bushmen, although this is perhaps not
quite true in the northern portion.. . . A tabulation of the foodstuffs
which the aborigines of northwest central Queensland extract from the
country they inhabit is instructive.. . . The variety in this list is
impressive, but we must not be deceived into thinking that variety
indicates plenty, for the available quantities of each element in it are
so slight that only the most intense application makes survival
possible.

(Herskovits, 1958, pp. 68–69)

Or again, in reference to South American hunters:

The nomadic hunters and gatherers barely met minimum subsistence needs
and often fell far short of them. Their population of 1 person to 10 or
20 square miles reflects this. Constantly on the move in search of food,
they clearly lacked the leisure hours for nonsubsistence activities of
any significance, and they could transport little of what they might
manufacture in spare moments. To them, adequacy of production meant
physical survival, and they rarely had surplus of either products or
time.

(Steward and Faron, 1959, p. 60; cf. Clark, 1953, p. 27 f;
Haury, 1962, p. 113; Hoebel, 1958, p. 188;
Redfield, 1953, p. 5; White, 1959)

But the traditional dismal view of the hunters’ fix is also preanthro
pological and extra-anthropological, at once historical and referable to
the larger economic context in which anthropology operates. It goes back
to the time Adam Smith was writing, and probably to a time before anyone
was writing.¹ Probably it was one of the first distinctly neolithic
prejudices, an ideological appreciation of the hunter’s capacity to
exploit the earth’s resources most congenial to the historic task of
depriving him of the same. We must have inherited it with the seed of
Jacob, which “spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the
north,” to the disadvantage of Esau who was the elder son and cunning
hunter, but in a famous scene deprived of his birthright.

Current low opinions of the hunting-gathering economy need not be laid
to neolithic ethnocentrism, however. Bourgeois ethnocentrism will do as
well. The existing business economy, at every turn an ideological trap
from which anthropological economics must escape, will promote the same
dim conclusions about the hunting life.

Is it so paradoxical to contend that hunters have affluent economies,
their absolute poverty notwithstanding? Modern capitalist societies,
however richly endowed, dedicate themselves to the proposition of
scarcity. Inadequacy of economic means is the first principle of the
world’s wealthiest peoples. The apparent material status of the economy
seems to be no clue to its accomplishments; something has to be said for
the mode of economic organization (cf. Polanyi, 1947, 1957, 1959;
Dalton, 1961).

The market-industrial system institutes scarcity, in a manner completely
unparalleled and to a degree nowhere else approximated. Where production
and distribution are arranged through the behavior of prices, and all
livelihoods depend on getting and spending, insufficiency of material
means becomes the explicit, calculable starting point of all economic
activity.² The entrepreneur is confronted with alternative investments
of a finite capital, the worker (hopefully) with alternative choices of
remunerative employ, and the consumer. . . . Consumption is a double
tragedy: what begins in inadequacy will end in deprivation. Bringing
together an international division of labor, the market makes available
a dazzling array of products: all these Good Things within a man’s
reach—but never all within his grasp. Worse, in this game of consumer
free choice, every acquisition is simultaneously a deprivation, for
every purchase of something is a foregoing of something else, in general
only marginally less desirable, and in some particulars more desirable,
that could have been had instead. (The point is that if you buy one
automobile, say a Plymouth, you cannot also have the Ford—and I judge
from current television commercials that the deprivations entailed would
be more than just material.)³

That sentence of “life at hard labor” was passed uniquely upon us.
Scarcity is the judgment decreed by our economy—so also the axiom of our
Economics: the application of scarce means against alternative ends to
derive the most satisfaction possible under the circumstances. And it is
precisely from this anxious vantage that we look back upon hunters. But
if modern man, with all his technological advantages, still hasn’t got
the wherewithal, what chance has this naked savage with his puny bow and
arrow? Having equipped the hunter with bourgeois impulses and
paleolithic tools, we judge his situation hopeless in advance.⁴

Yet scarcity is not an intrinsic property of technical means. It is a
relation between means and ends. We should entertain the empirical
possibility that hunters are in business for their health, a finite
objective, and that bow and arrow are adequate to that end.⁵

But still other ideas, these endemic in anthropological theory and
ethnographic practice, have conspired to preclude any such
understanding.

The anthropological disposition to exaggerate the economic inefficiency
of hunters appears notably by way of invidious comparison with neolithic
economies. Hunters, as Lowie put it blankly, “must work much harder in
order to live than tillers and breeders” (1946, p. 13). On this point
evolutionary anthropology in particular found it congenial, even
necessary theoretically, to adopt the usual tone of reproach.
Ethnologists and archaeologists had become neolithic revolutionaries,
and in their enthusiasm for the Revolution spared nothing denouncing the
Old (Stone Age) Regime, including some very old scandal. It was not the
first time philosophers would relegate the earliest stage of humanity
rather to nature than to culture. (“A man who spends his whole life
following animals just to kill them to eat, or moving from one berry
patch to another, is really living just like an animal
himself”[Braidwood, 1957, p. 122].) The hunters thus downgraded,
anthropology was free to extol the Neolithic Great Leap Forward: a main
technological advance that brought about a “general availability of
leisure through release from purely food-getting pursuits” (Braidwood,
1952, p. 5; cf. Boas, 1940, p. 285).

In an influential essay on “Energy and the Evolution of Culture,” Leslie
White explained that the neolithic generated a “great advance in
cultural development . . . as a consequence of the great increase in the
amount of energy harnessed and controlled per capita per year by means
of the agricultural and pastoral arts” (1949, p. 372). White further
heightened the evolutionary contrast by specifying human effort as the
principal energy source of paleolithic culture, as opposed to the
domesticated plant and animal resources of neolithic culture. This
determination of the energy sources at once permitted a precise low
estimate of hunters’ thermodynamic potential—that developed by the human
body: “average power resources” of one-twentieth horsepower per capita
(1949, p. 369)— even as, by eliminating human effort from the cultural
enterprise of the neolithic, it appeared that people had been liberated
by some laborsaving device (domesticated plants and animals). But
White’s problematic is obviously misconceived. The principal mechanical
energy available to both paleolithic and neolithic culture is that
supplied by human beings, as transformed in both cases from plant and
animal sources, so that, with negligible exceptions (the occasional
direct use of nonhuman power), the amount of energy harnessed per capita
per year is the same in paleolithic and neolithic economies—and fairly
constant in human history until the advent of the industrial
revolution.⁶

Another specifically anthropological source of paleolithic discontent
develops in the field itself, from the context of European observation
of existing hunters and gatherers, such as the native Australians, the
Bushmen, the Ona or the Yahgan. This ethnographic context tends to
distort our understanding of the hunting-gathering economy in two ways.

First, it provides singular opportunities for naïveté. The remote and
exotic environments that have become the cultural theater of modern
hunters have an effect on Europeans most unfavorable to the latter’s
assessment of the former’s plight. Marginal as the Australian or
Kalahari desert is to agriculture, or to everyday European experience,
it is a source of wonder to the untutored observer “how anybody could
live in a place like this.” The inference that the natives manage only
to eke out a bare existence is apt to be reinforced by their marvelously
varied diets (cf. Herskovits, 1958, quoted above). Ordinarily including
objects deemed repulsive and inedible by Europeans, the local cuisine
lends itself to the supposition that the people are starving to death.
Such a conclusion, of course, is more likely met in earlier than in
later accounts, and in the journals of explorers or missionaries, than
in the monographs of anthropologists; but precisely because the
explorers’ reports are older and closer to the aboriginal condition, one
reserves for them a certain respect.

Such respect obviously has to be accorded with discretion. Greater
attention should be paid to a man such as Sir George Grey (1841), whose
expeditions in the 1830s included some of the poorer districts of
western Australia, but whose unusually close attention to the local
people obliged him to debunk his colleagues’ communications on just this
point of economic desperation. It is a mistake very commonly made, Grey
wrote, to suppose that the native Australians “have small means of
subsistence, or are at times greatly pressed for want of food.” Many and
“almost ludicrous” are the errors travellers have fallen into in this
regard: “They lament in their journals that the unfortunate Aborigines
should be reduced by famine to the miserable necessity of subsisting on
certain sorts of food, which they have found near their huts; whereas,
in many instances, the articles thus quoted by them are those which the
natives most prize, and are really neither deficient in flavour nor
nutritious qualities.” To render palpable “the ignorance that has
prevailed with regard to the habits and customs of this people when in
their wild state,” Grey provides one remarkable example, a citation from
his fellow explorer, Captain Sturt, who, upon encountering a group of
Aboriginals engaged in gathering large quantities of mimosa gum, deduced
that the“ ‘unfortunate creatures were reduced to the last extremity,
and, being unable to procure any other nourishment, had been obliged to
collect this mucilaginous.’ ” But, Sir George observes, the gum in
question is a favorite article of food in the area, and when in season
it affords the opportunity for large numbers of people to assemble and
camp together, which otherwise they are unable to do. He concludes:

Generally speaking, the natives live well; in some districts there may
be at particular seasons of the year a deficiency of food, but if such
is the case, these tracts are, at those times, deserted. It is, however,
utterly impossible for a traveller or even for a strange native to judge
whether a district affords an abundance of food, or the contrary . ..
But in his own district a native is very differently situated; he knows
exactly what it produces, the proper time at which the several articles
are in season, and the readiest means of procuring them. According to
these circumstances he regulates his visits to different portions of his
hunting ground; and I can only say that I have always found the greatest
abundance in their huts.

(Grey, 1841, vol. 2, pp. 259–262, emphasis mine; cf. Eyre, 1845, vol. 2,
p. 244 f)⁷

In making this happy assessment, Sir George took special care to exclude
the lumpen-proletariat aboriginals living in and about European towns
(cf. Eyre, 1845, vol. 2, pp. 250, 254–255). The exception is
instructive. It evokes a second source of ethnographic misconceptions:
the anthropology of hunters is largely an anachronistic study of
ex-savages—an inquest into the corpse of one society, Grey once said,
presided over by members of another.

The surviving food collectors, as a class, are displaced persons. They
represent the paleolithic disenfranchised, occupying marginal haunts
untypical of the mode of production: sanctuaries of an era, places so
beyond the range of main centers of cultural advance as to be allowed
some respite from the planetary march of cultural evolution, because
they were characteristically poor beyond the interest and competence of
more advanced economies. Leave aside the favorably situated food
collecters, such as Northwest Coast Indians, about whose (comparative)
well-being there is no dispute. The remaining hunters, barred from the
better parts of the earth, first by agriculture, later by industrial
economies, enjoy ecological opportunities something less than the
later-paleolithic average.⁸ Moreover, the disruption accomplished in the
past two centuries of European imperialism has been especially severe,
to the extent that many of the ethnographic notices that constitute the
anthropologist’s stock in trade are adulterated culture goods. Even
explorer and missionary accounts, apart from their ethnocentric
misconstructions, may be speaking of afflicted economies (cf. Service,
1962). The hunters of eastern Canada of whom we read in the Jesuit
Relations were committed to the fur trade in the early seventeenth
century. The environments of others were selectively stripped by
Europeans before reliable report could be made of indigenous production:
the Eskimo we know no longer hunt whales, the Bushmen have been deprived
of game, the Shoshoni’s piñon has been timbered and his hunting grounds
grazed out by cattle.⁹ If such peoples are now described as
poverty-stricken, their resources “meagre and unreliable,” is this an
indication of the aboriginal condition—or of the colonial duress?

The enormous implications (and problems) for evolutionary interpretation
raised by this global retreat have only recently begun to evoke notice
(Lee and Devore, 1968). The point of present importance is this: rather
than a fair test of hunters’ productive capacities, their current
circumstances pose something of a supreme test. All the more
extraordinary, then, the following reports of their performance.


"A Kind of Material Plenty"

Considering the poverty in which hunters and gatherers live in theory,
it comes as a surprise that Bushmen who live in the Kalahari enjoy “a
kind of material plenty,” at least in the realm of everyday useful
things, apart from food and water:

As the!Kung come into more contact with Europeans—and this is already
happening—they will feel sharply the lack of our things and will need
and want more. It makes them feel inferior to be without clothes when
they stand among strangers who are clothed. But in their own life and
with their own artifacts they were comparatively free from material
pressures. Except for food and water (important exceptions!) of which
the Nyae Nyae!Kung have a sufficiency—but barely so, judging from the
fact that all are thin though not emaciated—they all had what they
needed or could make what they needed, for every man can and does make
the things that men make and every woman the things that women make.. .
. They lived in a kind of material plenty because they adapted the tools
of their living to materials which lay in abundance around them and
which were free for anyone to take (wood, reeds, bone for weapons and
implements, fibers for cordage, grass for shelters), or to materials
which were at least sufficient for the needs of the population.. . .
The!Kung could always use more ostrich egg shells for beads to wear or
trade with, but, as it is, enough are found for every woman to have a
dozen or more shells for water containers—all she can carry—and a goodly
number of bead ornaments. In their nomadic hunting-gathering life,
travelling from one source of food to another through the seasons,
always going back and forth between food and water, they carry their
young children and their belongings. With plenty of most materials at
hand to replace artifacts as required, the!Kung have not developed means
of permanent storage and have not needed or wanted to encumber
themselves with surpluses or duplicates. They do not even want to carry
one of everything. They borrow what they do not own. With this ease,
they have not hoarded, and the accumulation of objects has not become
associated with status.

(Marshall, 1961, pp. 243–44, emphasis mine)

Analysis of hunter-gatherer production is usefully divided into two
spheres, as Mrs. Marshall has done. Food and water are certainly
“important exceptions,” best reserved for separate and extended
treatment. For the rest, the nonsubsistence sector, what is here said of
the Bushmen applies in general and in detail to hunters from the
Kalahari to Labrador—or to Tièrra del Fuego, where Gusinde reports of
the Yahgan that their disinclination to own more than one copy of
utensils frequently needed is “an indication of self-confidence.” “Our
Fuegians,” he writes, “procure and make their implements with little
effort” (1961, p. 213).¹⁰

In the nonsubsistence sphere, the people’s wants are generally easily
satisfied. Such “material plenty” depends partly upon the ease of
production, and that upon the simplicity of technology and democracy of
property. Products are homespun: of stone, bone, wood, skin— materials
such as “lay in abundance around them.” As a rule, neither extraction of
the raw material nor its working up take strenuous effort. Access to
natural resources is typically direct—“free for anyone to take”—even as
possession of the necessary tools is general and knowledge of the
required skills common. The division of labor is likewise simple,
predominantly a division of labor by sex. Add in the liberal customs of
sharing, for which hunters are properly famous, and all the people can
usually participate in the going prosperity, such as it is.

But, of course, “such as it is”: this “prosperity” depends as well upon
an objectively low standard of living. It is critical that the customary
quota of consumables (as well as the number of consumers) be culturally
set at a modest point. A few people are pleased to consider a few
easily-made things their good fortune: some meagre pieces of clothing
and rather fugitive housing in most climates;¹¹ plus a few ornaments,
spare flints and sundry other items such as the “pieces of quartz, which
native doctors have extracted from their patients” (Grey, 1841, vol. 2,
p. 266); and, finally, the skin bags in which the faithful wife carries
all this, “the wealth of the Australian savage” (p. 266).

For most hunters, such affluence without abundance in the
nonsub-sistence sphere need not be long debated. A more interesting
question is why they are content with so few possessions—for it is with
them a policy, a “matter of principle” as Gusinde says (1961, p. 2), and
not a misfortune.

Want not, lack not. But are hunters so undemanding of material goods
because they are themselves enslaved by a food quest “demanding maximum
energy from a maximum number of people,” so that no time or effort
remains for the provision of other comforts? Some ethnographers testify
to the contrary that the food quest is so successful that half the time
the people seem not to know what to do with themselves. On the other
hand, movement is a condition of this success, more movement in some
cases than others, but always enough to rapidly depreciate the
satisfactions of property. Of the hunter it is truly said that his
wealth is a burden. In his condition of life, goods can become
“grievously oppressive,” as Gusinde observes, and the more so the longer
they are carried around. Certain food collecters do have canoes and a
few have dog sleds, but most must carry themselves all the comforts they
possess, and so only possess what they can comfortably carry themselves.
Or perhaps only what the women can carry: the men are often left free to
react to the sudden opportunity of the chase or the sudden necessity of
defense. As Owen Lattimore wrote in a not too different context, “the
pure nomad is the poor nomad.” Mobility and property are in
contradiction.

That wealth quickly becomes more of an encumbrance than a good thing is
apparent even to the outsider. Laurens van der Post was caught in the
contradiction as he prepared to make farewells to his wild Bushmen
friends:

This matter of presents gave us many an anxious moment. We were
humiliated by the realization of how little there was we could give to
the Bushmen. Almost everything seemed likely to make life more difficult
for them by adding to the litter and weight of their daily round. They
themselves had practically no possessions: a loin strap, a skin blanket
and a leather satchel. There was nothing that they could not assemble in
one minute, wrap up in their blankets and carry on their shoulders for a
journey of a thousand miles. They had no sense of possession.

(1958, p. 276)

A necessity so obvious to the casual visitor must be second nature to
the people concerned. This modesty of material requirements is
institutionalized: it becomes a positive cultural fact, expressed in a
variety of economic arrangements. Lloyd Warner reports of the Murngin,
for example, that portability is a decisive value in the local scheme of
things. Small goods are in general better than big goods. In the final
analysis “the relative ease of transportation of the article” will
prevail, so far as determining its disposition, over its relative
scarcity or labor cost. For the “ultimate value,” Warner writes, “is
freedom of movement.” And to this “desire to be free from the burdens
and responsibilities of objects which would interfere with the society’s
itinerant existence,” Warner attributes the Murngin’s “undeveloped sense
of property,” and their “lack of interest in developing their
technological equipment” (1964, pp. 136–137).

Here then is another economic “peculiarity”—I will not say it is
general, and perhaps it is explained as well by faulty toilet training
as by a trained disinterest in material accumulation: some hunters, at
least, display a notable tendency to be sloppy about their possessions.
They have the kind of nonchalance that would be appropriate to a people
who have mastered the problems of production, even as it is maddening to
a European:

They do not know how to take care of their belongings. No one dreams of
putting them in order, folding them, drying or cleaning them, hanging
them up, or putting them in a neat pile. If they are looking for some
particular thing, they rummage carelessly through the hodgepodge of
trifles in the little baskets. Larger objects that are piled up in a
heap in the hut are dragged hither and yon with no regard for the damage
that might be done them. The European observer has the impression that
these [Yahgan] Indians place no value whatever on their utensils and
that they have completely forgotten the effort it took to make them.¹²
Actually, no one clings to his few goods and chattels which, as it is,
are often and easily lost, but just as easily replaced.... The Indian
does not even exercise care when he could conveniently do so. A European
is likely to shake his head at the boundless indifference of these
people who drag brand-new objects, precious clothing, fresh provisions,
and valuable items through thick mud, or abandon them to their swift
destruction by children and dogs.... Expensive things that are given
them are treasured for a few hours, out of curiousity; after that they
thoughtlessly let everything deteriorate in the mud and wet. The less
they own, the more comfortable they can travel, and what is ruined they
occasionally replace. Hence, they are completely indifferent to any
material possessions.

(Gusinde, 1961, pp. 86–87)

The hunter, one is tempted to say, is “uneconomic man.” At least as
concerns nonsubsistence goods, he is the reverse of that standard
caricature immortalized in any General Principles of Economics, page
one. His wants are scarce and his means (in relation) plentiful.
Consequently he is “comparatively free of material pressures,” has “no
sense of possession,” shows “an undeveloped sense of property,” is
“completely indifferent to any material pressures,” manifests a “lack of
interest” in developing his technological equipment.

In this relation of hunters to worldly goods there is a neat and
important point. From the internal perspective of the economy, it seems
wrong to say that wants are “restricted,” desires “restrained,” or even
that the notion of wealth is “limited.” Such phrasings imply in advance
an Economic Man and a struggle of the hunter against his own worse
nature, which is finally then subdued by a cultural vow of poverty. The
words imply the renunciation of an acquisitiveness that in reality was
never developed, a suppression of desires that were never broached.
Economic Man is a bourgeois construction— as Marcel Mauss said, “not
behind us, but before, like the moral man.” It is not that hunters and
gatherers have curbed their materialistic “impulses”; they simply never
made an institution of them. “Moreover, if it is a great blessing to be
free from a great evil, our [Montagnais] Savages are happy; for the two
tyrants who provide hell and torture for many of our Europeans, do not
reign in their great forests,—I mean ambition and avarice . . . as they
are contented with a mere living, not one of them gives himself to the
Devil to acquire wealth” (LeJeune, 1897, p. 231).

We are inclined to think of hunters and gatherers as poor because they
don’t have anything; perhaps better to think of them for that reason as
free. “Their extremely limited material possessions relieve them of all
cares with regard to daily necessities and permit them to enjoy life”
(Gusinde, 1961, p. 1).


Subsistence

When Herskovits was writing his Economic Anthropology (1958), it was
common anthropological practice to take the Bushmen or the native
Australians as “a classic illustration of a people whose economic
resources are of the scantiest,” so precariously situated that “only the
most intense application makes survival possible.” Today the “classic”
understanding can be fairly reversed—on evidence largely from these two
groups. A good case can be made that hunters and gatherers work less
than we do; and, rather than a continuous travail, the food quest is
intermittent, leisure abundant, and there is a greater amount of sleep
in the daytime per capita per year than in any other condition of
society.

Some of the substantiating evidence for Australia appears in early
sources, but we are fortunate especially to have now the quantitative
materials collected by the 1948 American-Australian Scientific
Expedition to Arnhem Land. Published in 1960, these startling data must
provoke some review of the Australian reportage going back for over a
century, and perhaps revision of an even longer period of
anthropological thought. The key research was a temporal study of
hunting and gathering by McCarthy and McArthur (1960), coupled to
McArthur’s analysis of the nutritional outcome.

Figures 1.1 and 1.2 summarize the principal production studies. These
were short-run observations taken during nonceremonial periods. The
record for Fish Creek (14 days) is longer as well as more detailed than
that for Hemple Bay (seven days). Only adults’ work has been reported,
so far as I can tell. The diagrams incorporate information on hunting,
plant collecting, preparing foods, and repairing weapons, as tabulated
by the ethnographers. The people in both camps were free-ranging native
Australians, living outside mission or other settlements during the
period of study, although such was not necessarily their permanent or
even their ordinary circumstance.¹³

[Figure 1.1 Hours per Day in Food-Connected Activities: Fish Creek Group
(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960)]

Figure 1.1 Hours per Day in Food-Connected Activities: Fish Creek Group
(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960)

One must have serious reservations about drawing general or historical
inferences from the Arnhem Land data alone. Not only was the context
less than pristine and the time of study too brief, but certain elements
of the modern situation may have raised productivity above aboriginal
levels: metal tools, for example, or the reduction of local pressure on
food resources by depopulation. And our uncertainty seems rather doubled
than neutralized by other current circumstances that, conversely, would
lower economic efficiency: these semi-independent hunters, for instance,
are probably not as skilled as their ancestors. For the moment, let us
consider the Arnhem Land conclusions as experimental, potentially
credible in the measure they are supported by other ethnographic or
historic accounts.

The most obvious, immediate conclusion is that the people do not work
hard. The average length of time per person per day put into the
appropriation and preparation of food was four or five hours. Moreover,
they do not work continuously. The subsistence quest was highly
intermittent. It would stop for the time being when the people had

[Figure 1.2 Hours per Day in Food-Connected Activities: Hemple Bay Group
(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960)]

Figure 1.2 Hours per Day in Food-Connected Activities: Hemple Bay Group
(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960)

procured enough for the time being, which left them plenty of time to
spare. Clearly in subsistence as in other sectors of production, we have
to do with an economy of specific, limited objectives. By hunting and
gathering these objectives are apt to be irregularly accomplished, so
the work pattern becomes correspondingly erratic.

In the event, a third characteristic of hunting and gathering unimagined
by the received wisdom: rather than straining to the limits of available
labor and disposable resources, these Australians seem to underuse their
objective economic possibilities.

The quantity of food gathered in one day by any of these groups could in
every instance have been increased. Although the search for food was,
for the women, a job that went on day after day without relief [but see
our Figures 1.1 and 1.2], they rested quite frequently, and did not
spend all the hours of daylight searching for and preparing food. The
nature of the men’s food-gathering was more sporadic, and if they had a
good catch one day they frequently rested the next.... Perhaps
unconsciously they weigh the benefit of greater supplies of food against
the effort involved in collecting it, perhaps they judge what they
consider to be enough, and when that is collected they stop.

(McArthur, 1960, p. 92)

It follows, fourthly, that the economy was not physically demanding. The
investigators’ daily journal indicates that the people pace themselves;
only once is a hunter described as “utterly exhausted” (McCarthy and
McArthur, 1960, pp. 150 f). Neither did the Arnhem Landers themselves
consider the task of subsistence onerous. “They certainly did not
approach it as an unpleasant job to be got over as soon as possible, nor
as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible” (McArthur,
1960, p. 92).¹⁴ In this connection, and also in relation to their
underuse of economic resources, it is noteworthy that the Arn-hem Land
hunters seem not to have been content with a “bare existence.” Like
other Australians (cf. Worsley, 1961, p. 173), they become dissatisfied
with an unvarying diet; some of their time appears to have gone into the
provision of diversity over and above mere sufficiency (McCarthy and
McArthur, 1960, p. 192).

In any case, the dietary intake of the Arnhem Land hunters was
adequate—according to the standards of the National Research Council of
America. Mean daily consumption per capita at Hemple Bay was 2,160
calories (only a four-day period of observation), and at Fish Creek
2,130 calories (11 days). Table 1.1 indicates the main daily consumption
of various nutrients, calculated by McArthur in percentages of the NRCA
recommended dietary allowances.

Finally, what does the Arnhem Land study say about the famous question
of leisure? It seems that hunting and gathering can afford extraordinary
relief from economic cares. The Fish Creek group maintained a virtually
full-time craftsman, a man 35 or 40 years old, whose true specialty
however seems to have been loafing:

He did not go out hunting at all with the men, but one day he netted
fish most vigorously. He occasionally went into the bush to get wild
bees’ nests. Wilira was an expert craftsman who repaired the spears and
spear-throwers, made smoking-pipes and drone-tubes, and hafted a stone
axe (on request) in a skillful manner; apart from these occupations he
spent most of his time talking, eating and sleeping.

(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960, p. 148)

Wilira was not altogether exceptional. Much of the time spared by the
Arnhem Land hunters was literally spare time, consumed in rest and sleep
(see Tables 1.2 and 1.3). The main alternative to work, changing off
with it in a complementary way, was sleep:

Table 1.1 Mean daily consumption as percentage of recommended allowances
(from McArthur, 1960)

[]

Apart from the time (mostly between definitive activities and during
cooking periods) spent in general social intercourse, chatting,
gossiping and so on, some hours of the daylight were also spent resting
and sleeping. On the average, if the men were in camp, they usually
slept after lunch from an hour to an hour and a half, or sometimes even
more. Also after returning from fishing or hunting they usually had a
sleep, either immediately they arrived or whilst game was being cooked.
At Hemple Bay the men slept if they returned early in the day but not if
they reached camp after 4.00 p.m. When in camp all day they slept at odd
times and always after lunch. The women, when out collecting in the
forest, appeared to rest more frequently than the men. If in camp all
day, they also slept at odd times, sometimes for long periods.

(McCarthy and McArthur, 1960, p. 193)

The failure of Arnhem Landers to “build culture” is not strictly from
want of time. It is from idle hands.

So much for the plight of hunters and gatherers in Arnhem Land. As for
the Bushmen, economically likened to Australian hunters by Herskovits,
two excellent recent reports by Richard Lee show their condition to be
indeed the same (Lee, 1968; 1969). Lee’s research merits a special
hearing not only because it concerns Bushmen, but specifically the Dobe
section of!Kung Bushmen, adjacent to the Nyae

Nyae about whose subsistence—in a context otherwise of “material
plenty”—Mrs. Marshall expressed important reservations. The Dobe occupy
an area of Botswana where!Kung Bushmen have been living for at least a
hundred years, but have only just begun to suffer dislocation pressures.
(Metal, however, has been available to the Dobe since 1880–90.) An
intensive study was made of the subsistence production of a dry season
camp with a population (41 people) near the mean of such settlements.
The observations extended over four weeks during July and August 1964, a
period of transition from more to less favorable seasons of the year,
hence fairly representative, it seems, of average subsistence
difficulties.

Despite a low annual rainfall (6 to 10 inches), Lee found in the Dobe
area a “surprising abundance of vegetation.” Food resources were “both
varied and abundant,” particularly the energy-rich man-getti nut—“so
abundant that millions of the nuts rotted on the ground each year for
want of picking” (all references in Lee, 1969, p. 59).¹⁵ His reports on
time spent in food-getting are remarkably close to the Arnhem Land
observations. Table 1.4 summarizes Lee’s data.

The Bushman figures imply that one man’s labor in hunting and gathering
will support four or five people. Taken at face value, Bushman food
collecting is more efficient than French farming in the period up to
World War II, when more than 20 percent of the population were engaged
in feeding the rest. Confessedly, the comparison is misleading, but not
as misleading as it is astonishing. In the total population of
free-ranging Bushmen contacted by Lee, 61.3 percent (152 of 248) were
effective food producers; the remainder were too young or too old to
contribute importantly. In the particular camp under scrutiny, 65
percent were “effectives.” Thus the ratio of food producers to the
general population is actually 3: 5 or 2: 3. But, these 65 percent of
the people “worked 36 percent of the time, and 35 percent of the people
did not work at all”! (Lee, 1969, p. 67).

Table 1.4 Summary of Dobe Bushmen work diary (from Lee, 1969)

[]

For each adult worker, this comes to about two and one-half days labor
per week. (“In other words, each productive individual supported herself
or himself and dependents and still had 3–½ to 5–½ days available for
other activities.”) A “day’s work” was about six hours; hence the Dobe
work week is approximately 15 hours, or an average of 2 hours 9 minutes
per day. Even lower than the Arnhem Land norms, this figure however
excludes cooking and the preparation of implements. All things
considered, Bushmen subsistence labors are probably very close to those
of native Australians.

Also like the Australians, the time Bushmen do not work in subsistence
they pass in leisure or leisurely activity. One detects again that
characteristic paleolithic rhythm of a day or two on, a day or two off—
the latter passed desultorily in camp. Although food collecting is the
primary productive activity, Lee writes, “the majority of the people’s
time (four to five days per week) is spent in other pursuits, such as
resting in camp or visiting other camps” (1969, p. 74):

A woman gathers on one day enough food to feed her family for three
days, and spends the rest of her time resting in camp, doing embroidery,
visiting other camps, or entertaining visitors from other camps. For
each day at home, kitchen routines, such as cooking, nut cracking,
collecting firewood, and fetching water, occupy one to three hours of
her time. This rhythm of steady work and steady leisure is maintained
throughout the year. The hunters tend to work more frequently than the
women, but their schedule is uneven. It is not unusual for a man to hunt
avidly for a week and then do no hunting at all for two or three weeks.
Since hunting is an unpredictable business and subject to magical
control, hunters sometimes experience a run of bad luck and stop hunting
for a month or longer. During these periods, visiting, entertaining, and
especially dancing are the primary activities of men.

(1968, p. 37)

The daily per capita subsistence yield for the Dobe Bushmen was 2,140
calories. However, taking into account body weight, normal activities,
and the age-sex composition of the Dobe population, Lee estimates the
people require only 1,975 calories per capita. Some of the surplus food
probably went to the dogs, who ate what the people left over. “The
conclusion can be drawn that the Bushmen do not lead a substandard
existence on the edge of starvation as has been commonly supposed”
(1969, p. 73).

Taken in isolation, the Arnhem Land and Bushmen reports mount a
disconcerting if not decisive attack on the entrenched theoretical
position. Artificial in construction, the former study in particular is
reasonably considered equivocal. But the testimony of the Arnhem Land
expedition is echoed at many points by observations made elsewhere in
Australia, as well as elsewhere in the hunting-gathering world. Much of
the Australian evidence goes back to the nineteenth century, some of it
to quite acute observers careful to make exception of the aboriginal
come into relation with Europeans, for “his food supply is restricted,
and . . . he is in many cases warned off from the waterholes which are
the centers of his best hunting grounds” (Spencer and Gillen, 1899, p.
50).

The case is altogether clear for the well-watered areas of southeastern
Australia. There the Aboriginals were favored with a supply of fish so
abundant and easily procured that one squatter on the Victorian scene of
the 1840s had to wonder “how that sage people managed to pass their time
before my party came and taught them to smoke” (Curr, 1965, p. 109).
Smoking at least solved the economic problem—nothing to do: “That
accomplishment fairly acquired . . . matters went on flowingly, their
leisure hours being divided between putting the pipe to its legitimate
purpose and begging my tobacco.” Somewhat more seriously, the old
squatter did attempt an estimate of the amount of time spent in hunting
and gathering by the people of the then Port Phillip’s District. The
women were away from the camp on gathering expeditions about six hours a
day, “half of that time being loitered away in the shade or by the
fire”; the men left for the hunt shortly after the women quit camp and
returned around the same time (p. 118). Curr found the food thus
acquired of “indifferent quality” although “readily procured,” the six
hours a day “abundantly sufficing” for that purpose; indeed the country
“could have supported twice the number of Blacks we found in it” (p.
120). Very similar comments were made by another old-timer, Clement
Hodgkinson, writing of an analogous environment in northeastern New
South Wales. A few minutes fishing would provide enough to feed “the
whole tribe” (Hodgkinson, 1845, p. 223; cf. Hiatt, 1965, pp. 103–104).
“Indeed, throughout all the country along the eastern coast, the blacks
have never suffered so much from scarcity of food as many commiserating
writers have supposed” (Hodgkinson, 1845, p. 227).

But the people who occupied these more fertile sections of Australia,
notably in the southeast, have not been incorporated in today’s
stereotype of an Aborigine. They were wiped out early.¹⁶ The European’s
relation to such “Blackfellows” was one of conflict over the continent’s
riches; little time or inclination was spared from the process of
destruction for the luxury of contemplation. In the event, ethnographic
consciousness would only inherit the slim pickings: mainly interior
groups, mainly desert people, mainly the Arunta. Not that the Arunta are
all that bad off—ordinarily, “his life is by no means a miserable or a
very hard one” (Spencer and Gillen, 1899, p. 7).¹⁷ But the Central
tribes should not be considered, in point of numbers or ecological
adaptation, typical of native Australians (cf. Meggitt, 1964). The
following tableau of the indigenous economy provided by John Edward
Eyre, who had traversed the south coast and penetrated the Flinders
range as well as sojourned in the richer Murray district, has the right
to be acknowledged at least as representative:

Throughout the greater portion of New Holland, where there do not happen
to be European settlers, and invariably when fresh water can be
permanently procured upon the surface, the native experiences no
difficulty whatever in procuring food in abundance all the year round.
It is true that the character of his diet varies with the changing
seasons, and the formation of the country he inhabits; but it rarely
happens that any season of the year, or any description of country does
not yield him both animal and vegetable food . .. Of these [chief]
articles [of food], many are not only procurable in abundance, but in
such vast quantities at the proper seasons, as to afford for a
considerable length of time an ample means of subsistence to many
hundreds of natives congregated at one place.. . . On many parts of the
coast, and in the larger inland rivers, fish are obtained of a very fine
description, and in great abundance. At Lake Victoria . .. I have seen
six hundred natives encamped together, all of whom were living at the
time upon fish procured from the lake, with the addition, perhaps, of
the leaves of the mesembryanthemum. When I went amongst them I never
perceived any scarcity in their camps.. . . At Moorunde, when the Murray
annually inundates the flats, fresh-water cray-fish make their way to
the surface of the ground . .. in such vast numbers that I have seen
four hundred natives live upon them for weeks together, whilst the
numbers spoiled or thrown away would have sustained four hundred
more.... An unlimited supply of fish is also procurable at the Murray
about the beginning of December... The number [of fish] procured ... in
a few hours is incredible.... Another very favourite article of food,
and equally abundant at a particular season of the year, in the eastern
portion of the continent, is a species of moth which the natives procure
from the cavities and hollows of the mountains in certain localities..
.. The tops, leaves, and stalks of a kind of cress, gathered at the
proper season of the year ... furnish a favourite, and inexhaustible
supply of food for an unlimited number of natives.... There are many
other articles of food among the natives, equally abundant and valuable
as those I have enumerated.

(Eyre, 1845, vol. 2, pp. 250–254)

Both Eyre and Sir George Grey, whose sanguine view of the indigenous
economy we have already noted (“I have always found the greatest
abundance in their huts”), left specific assessments, in hours per day,
of the Australians’ subsistence labors. (This in Grey’s case would
include inhabitants of quite undesirable parts of western Australia.)
The testimony of these gentlemen and explorers accords very closely with
the Arnhem Land averages obtained by McCarthy and McArthur. “In all
ordinary seasons,” wrote Grey (that is, when the people are not confined
to their huts by bad weather), “they can obtain, in two or three hours a
sufficient supply of food for the day, but their usual custom is to roam
indolently from spot to spot, lazily collecting it as they wander along”
(1841, vol. 2, p. 263; emphasis mine). Similarly, Eyre states: “In
almost every part of the continent which I have visited, where the
presence of Europeans, or their stock, has not limited, or destroyed
their original means of subsistence, I have found that the natives could
usually, in three or four hours, procure as much food as would last for
the day, and that without fatigue or labour” (1845, pp. 254–255;
emphasis mine).

The same discontinuity of subsistence of labor reported by McArthur and
McCarthy, the pattern of alternating search and sleep, is repeated,
furthermore, in early and late observations from all over the continent
(Eyre, 1845, vol. 2, pp. 253–254; Bulmer, in Smyth, 1878, vol. 1, p.
142; Mathew, 1910, p. 84; Spencer and Gillen, 1899, p. 32; Hiatt, 1965,
pp. 103–104). Basedow took it as the general custom of the Aboriginal:
“When his affairs are working harmoniously, game secured, and water
available, the aboriginal makes his life as easy as possible; and he
might to the outsider even appear lazy” (1925, p. 116).¹⁸

Meanwhile, back in Africa the Hadza have been long enjoying a comparable
ease, with a burden of subsistence occupations no more strenuous in
hours per day than the Bushmen or the Australian Aboriginals (Woodburn,
1968). Living in an area of “exceptional abundance” of animals and
regular supplies of vegetables (the vicinity of Lake Eyasi), Hadza men
seem much more concerned with games of chance than with chances of game.
During the long dry season especially, they pass the greater part of
days on end in gambling, perhaps only to lose the metal-tipped arrows
they need for big game hunting at other times. In any case, many men are
“quite unprepared or unable to hunt big game even when they possess the
necessary arrows.” Only a small minority, Woodburn writes, are active
hunters of large animals, and if women are generally more assiduous at
their vegetable collecting, still it is at a leisurely pace and without
prolonged labor (cf. p. 51; Woodburn, 1966). Despite this nonchalance,
and an only limited economic cooperation, Hadza “nonetheless obtain
sufficient food without undue effort.” Woodburn offers this “very rough
approximation” of subsistence-labor requirements: “Over the year as a
whole probably an average of less than two hours a day is spent
obtaining food” (Woodburn, 1968, p. 54).

Interesting that the Hadza, tutored by life and not by anthropology,
reject the neolithic revolution in order to keep their leisure. Although
surrounded by cultivators, they have until recently refused to take up
agriculture themselves, “mainly on the grounds that this would involve
too much hard work.”¹⁹ In this they are like the Bushmen, who respond to
the neolithic question with another: “Why should we plant, when there
are so many mongomongo nuts in the world?” (Lee, 1968, p. 33). Woodburn
moreover did form the impression, although as yet unsubstantiated, that
Hadza actually expend less energy, and probably less time, in obtaining
subsistence than do neighboring cultivators of East Africa (1968, p.
54).²⁰ To change continents but not contents, the fitful economic
commitment of the South American hunter, too, could seem to the European
outsider an incurable “natural disposition”:

... the Yamana are not capable of continuous, daily hard labor, much to
the chagrin of European farmers and employers for whom they often work.
Their work is more a matter of fits and starts, and in these occasional
efforts they can develop considerable energy for a certain time. After
that, however, they show a desire for an incalculably long rest period
during which they lie about doing nothing, without showing great
fatigue. . .. It is obvious that repeated irregularities of this kind
make the European employer despair, but the Indian cannot help it. It is
his natural disposition.

(Gusinde, 1961, p. 27)²¹

The hunter’s attitude towards farming introduces us, lastly, to a few
particulars of the way they relate to the food quest. Once again we
venture here into the internal realm of the economy, a realm sometimes
subjective and always difficult to understand; where, moreover, hunters
seem deliberately inclined to overtax our comprehension by customs so
odd as to invite the extreme interpretation that either these people are
fools or they really have nothing to worry about. The former would be a
true logical deduction from the hunter’s nonchalance, on the premise
that his economic condition is truly exigent. On the other hand, if a
livelihood is usually easily procured, if one can usually expect to
succeed, then the people’s seeming imprudence can no longer appear as
such. Speaking to unique developments of the market economy, to its
institutionalization of scarcity, Karl Polanyi said that our “animal
dependence upon food has been bared and the naked fear of starvation
permitted to run loose. Our humiliating enslavement to the material,
which all human culture is designed to mitigate, was deliberately made
more rigorous” (1947, p. 115). But our problems are not theirs, the
hunters and gatherers. Rather, a pristine affluence colors their
economic arrangements, a trust in the abundance of nature’s resources
rather than despair at the inadequacy of human means. My point is that
otherwise curious heathen devices become understandable by the people’s
confidence, a confidence which is the reasonable human attribute of a
generally successful economy.²²

Consider the hunter’s chronic movements from camp to camp. This
nomadism, often taken by us as a sign of a certain harassment, is
undertaken by them with a certain abandon. The Aboriginals of Victoria,
Smyth recounts, are as a rule “lazy travellers. They have no motive to
induce them to hasten their movements. It is generally late in the
morning before they start on their journey, and there are many
interruptions by the way” (1878, vol. 1, p. 125; emphasis mine). The
good Pere Biard in his Relation of 1616, after a glowing description of
the foods available in their season to the Micmac (“Never had Solomon
his mansion better regulated and provided with food ”), goes on in the
same tone:

In order to thoroughly enjoy this, their lot, our foresters start off to
their different places with as much pleasure as if they were going on a
stroll or an excursion; they do this easily through the skillful use and
great convenience of canoes . .. so rapidly sculled that, without any
effort, in good weather you can make thirty or forty leagues a day;
nevertheless we scarcely see these Savages posting along at this rate,
for their days are all nothing but pastime. They are never in a hurry.
Quite different from us, who can never do anything without hurry and
worry....

(Biard, 1897, pp. 84–85)

Certainly, hunters quit camp because food resources have given out in
the vicinity. But to see in this nomadism merely a flight from
starvation only perceives the half of it; one ignores the possibility
that the people’s expectations of greener pastures elsewhere are not
usually disappointed. Consequently their wanderings, rather than
anxious, take on all the qualities of a picnic outing on the Thames.

A more serious issue is presented by the frequent and exasperated
observation of a certain “lack of foresight” among hunters and
gatherers. Oriented forever in the present, without “the slightest
thought of, or care for, what the morrow may bring” (Spencer and Gillen,
1899, p. 53), the hunter seems unwilling to husband supplies, incapable
of a planned response to the doom surely awaiting him. He adopts instead
a studied unconcern, which expresses itself in two complementary
economic inclinations.

The first, prodigality: the propensity to eat right through all the food
in the camp, even during objectively difficult times, “as if,” LeJeune
said of the Montagnais, “the game they were to hunt was shut up in a
stable.” Basedow wrote of native Australians, their motto “might be
interpreted in words to the effect that while there is plenty for today
never care about tomorrow. On this account an Aboriginal is inclined to
make one feast of his supplies, in preference to a modest meal now and
another by and by” (1925, p. 116). LeJeune even saw his Montagnais carry
such extravagance to the edge of disaster:

In the famine through which we passed, if my host took two, three, or
four Beavers, immediately, whether it was day or night, they had a feast
for all neighboring Savages. And if those people had captured something,
they had one also at the same time; so that, on emerging from one feast,
you went to another, and sometimes even to a third and a fourth. I told
them that they did not manage well, and that it would be better to
reserve these feasts for future days, and in doing this they would not
be so pressed with hunger. They laughed at me. “Tomorrow” (they said)
“we shall make another feast with what we shall capture.” Yes, but more
often they capture only cold and wind.

(LeJeune, 1887, pp. 281–283)

Sympathetic writers have tried to rationalize the apparent
impracticality. Perhaps the people have been carried beyond reason by
hunger: they are apt to gorge themselves on a kill because they have
gone so long without meat—and for all they know they are likely to soon
do so again. Or perhaps in making one feast of his supplies a man is
responding to binding social obligations, to important imperatives of
sharing. LeJeune’s experience would confirm either view, but it also
suggests a third. Or rather, the Montagnais have their own explanation.
They are not worried by what the morrow may bring because as far as they
are concerned it will bring more of the same: “another feast.” Whatever
the value of other interpretations, such self-confidence must be brought
to bear on the supposed prodigality of hunters. More, it must have some
objective basis, for if hunters and gatherers really favored gluttony
over economic good sense, they would never have lived to become the
prophets of this new religion.

A second and complementary inclination is merely prodigality’s negative
side: the failure to put by food surpluses, to develop food storage. For
many hunters and gatherers, it appears, food storage cannot be proved
technically impossible, nor is it certain that the people are unaware of
the possibility (cf. Woodburn, 1968, p. 53). One must investigate
instead what in the situation precludes the attempt. Gusinde asked this
question, and for the Yahgan found the answer in the selfsame
justifiable optimism. Storage would be “superfluous,”

because throughout the entire year and with almost limitless generosity
the sea puts all kinds of animals at the disposal of the man who hunts
and the woman who gathers. Storm or accident will deprive a family of
these things for no more than a few days. Generally no one need reckon
with the danger of hunger, and everyone almost anywhere finds an
abundance of what he needs. Why then should anyone worry about food for
the future! ... Basically our Fuegians know that they need not fear for
the future, hence they do not pile up supplies. Year in and year out
they can look forward to the next day, free of care....

(Gusinde, 1961, pp. 336, 339)

Gusinde’s explanation is probably good as far as it goes, but probably
incomplete. A more complex and subtle economic calculus seems in
play—realized however by a social arithmetic exceedingly simple. The
advantages of food storage should be considered against the diminishing
returns to collection within the compass of a confined locale. An
uncontrollable tendency to lower the local carrying capacity is for
hunters au fond des choses: a basic condition of their production and
main cause of their movement. The potential drawback of storage is
exactly that it engages the contradiction between wealth and mobility.
It would anchor the camp to an area soon depleted of natural food
supplies. Thus immobilized by their accumulated stocks, the people may
suffer by comparison with a little hunting and gathering elsewhere,
where nature has, so to speak, done considerable storage of her own—of
foods possibly more desirable in diversity as well as amount than men
can put by. But this fine calculation—in any event probably symbolically
impossible (cf. Codere,1968)—would be worked out in a much simpler
binary opposition, set in social terms such as “love” and “hate.” For as
Richard Lee observes (1969, p. 75), the technically neutral activity of
food accumulation or storage is morally something else again,
“hoarding.” The efficient hunter who would accumulate supplies succeeds
at the cost of his own esteem, or else he gives them away at the cost of
his (superfluous) effort. As it works out, an attempt to stock up food
may only reduce the overall output of a hunting band, for the have-nots
will content themselves with staying in camp and living off the
wherewithal amassed by the more prudent. Food storage, then, may be
technically feasible, yet economically undesirable, and socially
unachievable.

If food storage remains limited among hunters, their economic
confidence, born of the ordinary times when all the people’s wants are
easily satisfied, becomes a permanent condition, carrying them laughing
through periods that would try even a Jesuit’s soul and worry him so
that—as the Indians warn—he could become sick:

I saw them, in their hardships and in their labors, suffer with
cheerfulness. . .. I found myself, with them, threatened with great
suffering; they said to me, “We shall be sometimes two days, sometimes
three, without eating, for lack of food; take courage, Chihiné, let thy
soul be strong to endure suffering and hardship; keep thyself from being
sad, otherwise thou wilt be sick; see how we do not cease to laugh,
although we have little to eat.”

(LeJeune, 1897, p. 283; cf. Needham, 1954, p. 230)


Rethinking Hunters and Gatherers

Constantly under pressure of want, and yet, by travelling, easily able
to supply their wants, their lives lack neither excitement or pleasure.

(Smyth, 1878, vol. 1, p. 123)

Clearly, the hunting-gathering economy has to be revaluated, both as to
its true accomplishments and its true limitations. The procedural fault
of the received wisdom was to read from the material circumstances to
the economic structure, deducing the absolute difficulty of such a life
from its absolute poverty. But always the cultural design improvises
dialectics on its relationship to nature. Without escaping the
ecological constraints, culture would negate them, so that at once the
system shows the impress of natural conditions and the originality of a
social response—in their poverty, abundance.

What are the real handicaps of the hunting-gathering praxis? Not “low
productivity of labor,” if existing examples mean anything. But the
economy is seriously afflicted by the imminence of diminishing returns.
Beginning in subsistence and spreading from there to every sector, an
initial success seems only to develop the probability that further
efforts will yield smaller benefits. This describes the typical curve of
food-getting within a particular locale. A modest number of people
usually sooner than later reduce the food resources within convenient
range of camp. Thereafter, they may stay on only by absorbing an
increase in real costs or a decline in real returns: rise in costs if
the people choose to search farther and farther afield; decline in
returns if they are satisfied to live on the shorter supplies or
inferior foods in easier reach. The solution, of course, is to go
somewhere else. Thus the first and decisive contingency of
hunting-gathering: it requires movement to maintain production on
advantageous terms.

But this movement, more or less frequent in different circumstances,
more or less distant, merely transposes to other spheres of production
the same diminishing returns of which it is born. The manufacture of
tools, clothing, utensils, or ornaments, however easily done, becomes
senseless when these begin to be more of a burden than a comfort.
Utility falls quickly at the margin of portability. The construction of
substantial houses likewise becomes absurd if they must soon be
abandoned. Hence the hunter’s very ascetic conceptions of material
welfare: an interest only in minimal equipment, if that; a valuation of
smaller things over bigger; a disinterest in acquiring two or more of
most goods; and the like. Ecological pressure assumes a rare form of
concreteness when it has to be shouldered. If the gross product is
trimmed down in comparison with other economies, it is not the hunter’s
productivity that is at fault, but his mobility.

Almost the same thing can be said of the demographic constraints of
hunting-gathering. The same policy of débarassment is in play on the
level of people, describable in similar terms and ascribable to similar
causes. The terms are, cold-bloodedly: diminishing returns at the margin
of portability, minimum necessary equipment, elimination of duplicates,
and so forth—that is to say, infanticide, senilicide, sexual continence
for the duration of the nursing period, etc., practices for which many
food-collecting peoples are well known. The presumption that such
devices are due to an inability to support more people is probably
true—if “support” is understood in the sense of carrying them rather
than feeding them. The people eliminated, as hunters sometimes sadly
tell, are precisely those who cannot effectively transport themselves,
who would hinder the movement of family and camp. Hunters may be obliged
to handle people and goods in parallel ways, the draconic population
policy an expression of the same ecology as the ascetic economy. More,
these tactics of demographic restraint again form part of a larger
policy for counteracting diminishing returns in subsistence. A local
group becomes vulnerable to diminishing returns—so to a greater velocity
of movement, or else to fission—in proportion to its size (other things
equal). Insofar as the people would keep the advantage in local
production, and maintain a certain physical and social stability, their
Malthusian practices are just cruelly consistent. Modern hunters and
gatherers, working their notably inferior environments, pass most of the
year in very small groups widely spaced out. But rather than the sign of
underproduction, the wages of poverty, this demographic pattern is
better understood as the cost of living well.

Hunting and gathering has all the strengths of its weaknesses. Periodic
movement and restraint in wealth and population are at once imperatives
of the economic practice and creative adaptations, the kinds of
necessities of which virtues are made. Precisely in such a framework,
affluence becomes possible. Mobility and moderation put hunters’ ends
within range of their technical means. An undeveloped mode of production
is thus rendered highly effective. The hunter’s life is not as difficult
as it looks from the outside. In some ways the economy reflects dire
ecology, but it is also a complete inversion.

Reports on hunters and gatherers of the ethnological present—
specifically on those in marginal environments—suggest a mean of three
to five hours per adult worker per day in food production. Hunters keep
banker’s hours, notably less than modern industrial workers (unionized),
who would surely settle for a 21–35 hour week. An interesting comparison
is also posed by recent studies of labor costs among agriculturalists of
neolithic type. For example, the average adult Hanunoo, man or woman,
spends 1,200 hours per year in swidden cultivation (Conklin, 1957, p.
151); which is to say, a mean of three hours twenty minutes per day. Yet
this figure does not include food gathering, animal raising, cooking and
other direct subsistence efforts of these Philippine tribesmen.
Comparable data are beginning to appear in reports on other primitive
agriculturalists from many parts of the world. The conclusion is put
conservatively when put negatively: hunters and gatherers need not work
longer getting food than do primitive cultivators. Extrapolating from
ethnography to prehistory, one may say as much for the neolithic as John
Stuart Mill said of all labor-saving devices, that never was one
invented that saved anyone a minute’s labor. The neolithic saw no
particular improvement over the paleolithic in the amount of time
required per capita for the production of subsistence; probably, with
the advent of agriculture, people had to work harder.

There is nothing either to the convention that hunters and gatherers can
enjoy little leisure from tasks of sheer survival. By this, the
evolutionary inadequacies of the paleolithic are customarily explained,
while for the provision of leisure the neolithic is roundly
congratulated. But the traditional formulas might be truer if reversed:
the amount of work (per capita) increases with the evolution of culture,
and the amount of leisure decreases. Hunters’ subsistence labors are
characteristically intermittent, a day on and a day off, and modern
hunters at least tend to employ their time off in such activities as
daytime sleep. In the tropical habitats occupied by many of these
existing hunters, plant collecting is more reliable than hunting itself.
Therefore, the women, who do the collecting, work rather more regularly
than the men, and provide the greater part of the food supply. Man’s
work is often done. On the other hand, it is likely to be highly
erratic, unpredictably required; if men lack leisure, it is then in the
Enlightenment sense rather than the literal. When Condorcet attributed
the hunter’s unprogressive condition to want of “the leisure in which he
can indulge in thought and enrich his understanding with new
combinations of ideas,” he also recognized that the economy was a
“necessary cycle of extreme activity and total idleness.” Apparently
what the hunter needed was the assured leisure of an aristocratic
philosophe.

Hunters and gatherers maintain a sanguine view of their economic state
despite the hardships they sometimes know. It may be that they sometimes
know hardships because of the sanguine views they maintain of their
economic state. Perhaps their confidence only encourages prodigality to
the extent the camp falls casualty to the first untoward circumstance.
In alleging this is an affluent economy, therefore, I do not deny that
certain hunters have moments of difficulty. Some do find it “almost
inconceivable” for a man to die of hunger, or even to fail to satisfy
his hunger for more than a day or two (Woodburn, 1968, p. 52). But
others, especially certain very peripheral hunters spread out in small
groups across an environment of extremes, are exposed periodically to
the kind of inclemency that interdicts travel or access to game. They
suffer—although perhaps only fractionally, the shortage affecting
particular immobilized families rather than the society as a whole (cf.
Gusinde, 1961, pp. 306–307).

Still, granting this vulnerability, and allowing the most poorly
situated modern hunters into comparison, it would be difficult to prove
that privation is distinctly characteristic of the hunter-gatherers.
Food shortage is not the indicative property of this mode of production
as opposed to others; it does not mark off hunters and gatherers as a
class or a general evolutionary stage. Lowie asks:

But what of the herders on a simple plane whose maintenance is
periodically jeopardized by plagues—who, like some Lapp bands of the
nineteenth century were obliged to fall back on fishing? What of the
primitive peasants who clear and till without compensation of the soil,
exhaust one plot and pass on to the next, and are threatened with famine
at every drought? Are they any more in control of misfortune caused by
natural conditions than the hunter-gatherer?

(1938, p. 286)

Above all, what about the world today? One-third to one-half of humanity
are said to go to bed hungry every night. In the Old Stone Age the
fraction must have been much smaller. This is the era of hunger
unprecedented. Now, in the time of the greatest technical power, is
starvation an institution. Reverse another venerable formula: the amount
of hunger increases relatively and absolutely with the evolution of
culture.

This paradox is my whole point. Hunters and gatherers have by force of
circumstances an objectively low standard of living. But taken as their
objective, and given their adequate means of production, all the
people’s material wants usually can be easily satisfied. The evolution
of economy has known, then, two contradictory movements: enriching but
at the same time impoverishing, appropriating in relation to nature but
expropriating in relation to man. The progressive aspect is, of course,
technological. It has been celebrated in many ways: as an increase in
the amount of need-serving goods and services, an increase in the amount
of energy harnessed to the service of culture, an increase in
productivity, an increase in division of labor, and increased freedom
from environmental control. Taken in a certain sense, the last is
especially useful for understanding the earliest stages of technical
advance. Agriculture not only raised society above the distribution of
natural food resources, it allowed neolithic communities to maintain
high degrees of social order where the requirements of human existence
were absent from the natural order. Enough food could be harvested in
some seasons to sustain the people while no food would grow at all; the
consequent stability of social life was critical for its material
enlargement. Culture went on then from triumph to triumph, in a kind of
progressive contravention of the biological law of the minimum, until it
proved it could support human life in outer space—where even gravity and
oxygen were naturally lacking.

Other men were dying of hunger in the market places of Asia. It has been
an evolution of structures as well as technologies, and in that respect
like the mythical road where for every step the traveller advances his
destination recedes by two. The structures have been political as well
as economic, of power as well as property. They developed first within
societies, increasingly now between societies. No doubt these structures
have been functional, necessary organizations of the technical
development, but within the communities they have thus helped to enrich
they would discriminate in the distribution of wealth and differentiate
in the style of life. The world’s most primitive people have few
possessions, but they are not poor. Poverty is not a certain small
amount of goods, nor is it just a relation between means and ends; above
all it is a relation between people. Poverty is a social status. As such
it is the invention of civilization. It has grown with civilization, at
once as an invidious distinction between classes and more importantly as
a tributary relation—that can render agrarian peasants more susceptible
to natural catastrophes than any winter camp of Alaskan Eskimo.

All the preceding discussion takes the liberty of reading modern hunters
historically, as an evolutionary base line. This liberty should not be
lightly granted. Are marginal hunters such as the Bushmen of the
Kalahari any more representative of the paleolithic condition than the
Indians of California or the Northwest Coast? Perhaps not. Perhaps also
Bushmen of the Kalahari are not even representative of marginal hunters.
The great majority of surviving hunter-gatherers lead a life curiously
decapitated and extremely lazy by comparison with the other few. The
other few are very different. The Murngin, for example: “The first
impression that any stranger must receive in a fully functioning group
in Eastern Arnhem Land is of industry. . . And he must be impressed with
the fact that with the exception of very young children . . . there is
no idleness” (Thomson, 1949a, pp. 33–34). There is nothing to indicate
that the problems of livelihood are more difficult for these people than
for other hunters (cf. Thomson, 1949b). The incentives of their unusual
industry lie elsewhere: in “an elaborate and exacting ceremonial life,”
specifically in an elaborate ceremonial exchange cycle that bestows
prestige on craftsmanship and trade (Thomson, 1949a, pp. 26, 28, 34 f,
87 passim). Most other hunters have no such concerns. Their existence is
comparatively colorless, fixed singularly on eating with gusto and
digesting at leisure. The cultural orientation is not Dionysian or
Apollonian, but “gastric,” as Julian Steward said of the Shoshoni. Then
again it may be Dionysian, that is, Bacchanalian: “Eating among the
Savages is like drinking among the drunkards of Europe. Those dry and
ever-thirsty souls would willingly end their lives in a tub of malmsey,
and the Savages in a pot full of meat; those over there talk only of
drinking, and these here only of eating” (LeJeune, 1897, p. 249).

It is as if the superstructures of these societies had been eroded,
leaving only the bare subsistence rock, and since production itself is
readily accomplished, the people have plenty of time to perch there and
talk about it. I must raise the possibility that the ethnography of
hunters and gatherers is largely a record of incomplete cultures.
Fragile cycles of ritual and exchange may have disappeared without
trace, lost in the earliest stages of colonialism, when the intergroup
relations they mediated were attacked and confounded. If so, the
“original” affluent society will have to be rethought again for its
originality, and the evolutionary schemes once more revised. Still this
much history can always be rescued from existing hunters: the “economic
problem” is easily solvable by paleolithic techniques. But then, it was
not until culture neared the height of its material achievements that it
erected a shrine to the Unattainable: Infinite Needs.



2 THE DOMESTIC MODE OF PRODUCTION: THE STRUCTURE OF UNDERPRODUCTION


This chapter is constructed on an observation in apparent contradiction
to the pristine “affluence” I have just taken so much trouble to defend:
the primitive economies are underproductive. The main run of them,
agricultural as well as preagricultural, seem not to realize their own
economic capacities. Labor power is underused, technological means are
not fully engaged, natural resources are left untapped.

This is not the simple point that the output of primitive societies is
low: it is the complex problem that production is low relative to
existing possibilities. So understood, “underproduction” is not
necessarily inconsistent with a pristine “affluence.” All the people’s
material wants might still be easily satisfied even though the economy
is running below capacity. Indeed, the former is rather a condition of
the latter: given the modest ideas of “satisfaction” locally prevailing,
labor and resources need not be exploited to the full.

In any event, there are indications of underproduction from many parts
of the primitive world, and the first task of the essay is to give some
sense of the evidence. Beyond any initial attempt at explanation, the
discovery of this tendency—more precisely of several related tendencies
of the primitive economic performance—seems of greater importance. I
raise the possibility that underproduction is in the nature of the
economies at issue; that is, economies organized by domestic groups and
kinship relations.


Dimensions of Underproduction

Underuse of Resources

The major evidence for underexploitation of productive resources comes
from agricultural societies, especially those practicing slash-and-burn
cultivation. Probably this is a function of research procedures rather
than a dubious special privilege of the subsistence type. Similar
observations have been made of hunting and of herding economies, but
anecdotally for the most part, and without benefit of a practicable
measure. Slash-and-burn agriculture, on the other hand, uniquely lends
itself to quantified assessments of economic capacity. And in almost all
the cases so far investigated, still not numerous but from many
different parts of the globe, especially where the people have not been
confined to “native reserves,” the actual production is substantially
less than the possible.

Slash-and-burn, an agriculture of neolithic origin, is widely practiced
today in tropical forests. It is a technique for opening up and bringing
under cultivation a patch of forest land. The standing growth is first
cleared by axe or machete and, after a period of drying out, the
accumulated debris is burned off—thus the inelegant name,
siash-and-burn. A cleared plot is cultivated for one or two seasons,
rarely more, then abandoned for years, usually with a view toward
restoration of fertility through reversion to forest. The area may then
be opened again for another cycle of cultivation and fallow. Typically
the period of fallow is several times the period of use; hence, the
community of cultivators, if it is to remain stable, must always hold in
reserve several times the area it has under production at any given
moment. Measures of productive capacity must take this requirement into
consideration; also the period of garden use, the period of fallow, the
amount of land required per capita for subsistence, the amount of arable
land within range of the community, and the like. So long as these
measures are careful to respect the normal and customary practices of
the people concerned, the final estimate of capacity will not be
utopian—that is, what might be done with a free choice of techniques—but
only what could be done by the agricultural regime as it stands.

Nevertheless, there are inescapable uncertainties. Any “productive
capacity” so estimated is partial and derivative: partial, because the
investigation is restricted in advance to the cultivation of food, other
dimensions of production left aside; derivative, because “capacity”
takes the form of a population maximum. What research yields is the
optimum number of people that can be supported by the existing means of
production. “Capacity” appears as a determinate population size or
density, a critical mass that cannot be surpassed without some change in
agricultural practice or conception of livelihood. Beyond that point is
a dangerous ground of speculation which daring ecologists, identifying
the optimum population as the “critical carrying capacity” or “critical
population density,” all the same do not hesitate to enter. “Critical
carrying capacity” is the theoretical limit to which the population
could be taken without degrading the land and compromising the
agricultural future. But it is characteristically difficult to project
from the existing “optimum” to the persisting “critical”; such questions
of long-term adaptation are not decided by the short-term data. We have
to be content with a more limited, if possibly defective, understanding:
what the agricultural system as constituted can do.

W. Allan (1949, 1965) was the first to devise and apply a general index
of population capacity for slash-and-burn agriculture. Several versions
and variants of Allan’s formula¹ have since appeared, notably those of
Conklin (1959), Carneiro (1960), and a complicated refinement fashioned
by Brown and Brookfield for the New Guinea Highlands (1963). These
formulas have been applied to specific ethnographic sites and, with less
precision, to broad cultural provinces dominated by slash-and-burn
production. Outside of reservations, in traditional agricultural
systems, the results, although highly variable, are highly consistent in
one respect: the existing population is generally inferior to the
calculable maximum, often remarkably so.²

Table 2.1 summarizes a certain number of ethnographic studies of
population capacity from several world areas of shifting agriculture.
Two of these studies, those of the Chimbu and Kuikuru, merit special
comment.

Table 2.1 Relation of actual to potential population, swidden
cultivators

[]

[]

The Chimbu example is indeed theoretically privileged, not only for the
unusually sophisticated techniques developed by the investigators, but
because these techniques were tested on a system of peak density in one
of the most densely occupied areas of the primitive world. The Naregu
section of Chimbu studied by Brown and Brookfield certainly upholds the
New Guinea Highlands’ reputation: a mean density of 288 people/square
mile. Yet this density is only 64 percent of the prevailing agricultural
capacity. (The result of 64 percent is an average for 12 clan and
subclan territories of Naregu; the range was from 22 to 97 percent of
capacity; Table 2.2 on p.44 gives the breakdown by territory.) Brown and
Brookfield also made wider but less precise estimates for the 26 tribal
and subtribal sections of Chimbu as a whole, yielding conclusions of the
same order: mean population at 60 percent of capacity.³

The Kuikuru, on the other hand, illustrate another kind of extreme: the
scale of the disparity that may exist between potential and reality. The
Kuikuru village of 145 persons is only seven percent of the calculable
maximum population (Carneiro, 1960). Given the Kuikuru’s agricultural
practices, their present population of 145 is supported from the
cultivation of 947.25 acres. In fact, the community has a base of 13,350
acres (arable), sufficient for 2,041 persons.

Although studies such as these remain few, the results they present do
not appear to be exceptional nor limited to the instances in question.
On the contrary, reputable and sober authorities have been tempted to
generalize to the same effect about wide geographical areas with which
they are familiar. Carneiro, for example (projecting from Kuikuru but in
a way that presumes them unusually well off), considers that traditional
agriculture in the South American Tropical Forest Zone was capable of
sustaining village populations on the order of 450 people; whereas the
modal community throughout this extensive area was only 51–150 (1960).
The Congo forest of Africa, according to Allan, was likewise
underpopulated over wide stretches—“well below the apparent carrying
capacity of the land for the traditional systems of land use” (1965, p.
223). Again in West Africa, particularly Ghana before the cocoa boom,
Allan reports that “population densities in the central forest zone were
far below the critical levels” (p. 228; cf. pp. 229, 230, 240). J. E.
Spencer frames a similar opinion of shifting cultivation in Southeast
Asia. Impressed by the unusually high densities of upland New Guinea,
Spencer is inclined to believe “most shifting-cultivator societies are
operating at less than maximum potential so far as their agricultural
system is concerned” (1966, p. 16). His interpretation is of interest:

Table 2.2 Actual and maximum population capacities of Naregu Chimbu
Groups* (from Brown and Brookfield, 1963, pp. 117, 119)

[]

Light areal density patterns of population are naturally associated with
many groups following shifting cultivation because of their intrinsic
social system.... This cultural tradition cannot be interpreted in terms
of the carrying capacity of the land, so that the social phenomenon,
rather than the literal carrying capacity of the land itself, has
assumed the dynamic role of controlling population density.

(Spencer, 1966, pp. 15–16)

Let us underline the point, at the same time reserving it for fuller
discussion later. Spencer says that the social-cultural organization is
not designed after the technical limits of production, to maximize
output, but rather impedes development of the productive means. If this
position runs counter to a certain ecological thinking, it is
nevertheless repeated by several ethnographers of underproduction. For
the Ndembu, in Turner’s view (1957), it is the contradictions of
customary modes of residence and descent, coupled to an absence of
political centralization, that set off village fission and population
dispersal at a level inferior to the agricultural capacity. Izikowitz
(1951), speaking of Lamet, and Cameiro of Amazonian Indians (1968) alike
hold the weakness of the community polity responsible for an undue
centrifugal segmentation. Quite generally among the tribal cultivators,
the intensity of land use seems a specification of the social-political
organization.

To return to the technical facts and their distribution: slash-and-burn
agriculture is a major form of production among extant primitive
societies, perhaps the dominant form.⁴ Inquiries in a number of
communities, from several different world areas, confirm that (outside
native reserves) the agricultural system is running below its technical
capacity. More broadly, extensive areas of Africa, Southeast Asia, and
South American occupied by swidden cultivators are authoritatively
judged underexploited. May we be permitted to conclude that the dominant
form of primitive production is underproduction?⁵

Much less can be said about the performance of other common production
types. There are suggestions that hunting-gathering may be no more
intensive than slash-and-burn agriculture. But the interpretation of
resource underuse among hunters presents special difficulties, even
apart from the lack of a practicable measure. It is usually not possible
to determine whether an apparent underproduction of the moment
nonetheless represents a long-term adaptation to recurrent shortages,
bad years when it would be possible to support only a fraction of the
present population. All the more pertinent, then, is the following
remark of Richard Lee on!Kung Bushman subsistence, as the period of
field observation included the third year of a prolonged drought such as
rarely visits even the Kalahari Desert:

It is impossible to define “abundance” of resources absolutely. However,
one index of relative abundance is whether or not a population exhausts
all the food available from a given area. By this criterion, the habitat
of the Dobe-area Bushmen is abundant in naturally occuring foods. By far
the most important food is the Mongomongo (mangetti) nut.... Although
tens of thousands of pounds of these nuts are harvested and eaten each
year, thousands more rot on the ground each year for want of picking.

(Lee, 1968, p. 33; see also pp. 33–35)

Woodburn’s comments on Hadza hunting carry the same implication:

I have already mentioned the exceptional abundance of game animals in
this area. Although Hadza, in common probably with all other human
societies, do not eat all the types of animals available to them—they
reject civet, monitor lizard, snake, terrapin among others—they do eat
an unusually wide range of animals. . .. In spite of the large number of
species which they are both able to hunt and regard as edible, the Hadza
do not kill very many animals and it is probable that even in the
radically reduced area they occupied in 1960 more animals could have
been killed of every species without endangering the survival of any
species in question.

(Woodburn, 1968, p. 52)

In a work primarily devoted to subsistence agriculture, Clark and
Haswell (1964, p. 31) make a daring argument about preagricultural
resource use that at least invites contemplation. Basing their
calculations on certain data for East Africa summarized by Pirie
(1962),⁶ and positing certain conservative assumptions about animal
reproduction rates in the wild, Clark and Haswell estimate that the
annual natural yield of meat is forty times greater than necessary to
support a hunting population living at one person/20 square kilometers
(1/7.7 square miles) and exclusively on animal foods—that is to say, the
animal reproduction fully utilized would support five persons per square
mile. This without diminishing the natural supply. Whether hunters need
such a margin of safety is another, unanswered question, although Clark
and Haswell rather think they do.

A further implication of Pirie’s East African figures is that the wild
animal yield per area of natural grazing land is higher than the output
of pastoral nomadism in adjacent regions (cf. Worthington, 1961). Again,
Clark and Haswell generalize to an interesting judgment of pastoralist
land use:

We should remind ourselves that the primitive pastoral communities,
found where the land is not forested ... live at a density of about 2
persons/sq. km. Though not so wasteful of the land and its resources as
are the primitive hunting peoples, they nevertheless fall far short of
fully exploiting the potential mean output of land, which Price
estimates at 50 kg. liveweight gain/ha./year (5 tons liveweight gain/sq.
km.). Even if we half this figure, as some would do, it seems clear that
primitive pastoral peoples ... are unable to exploit the full growth of
grass in favourable seasons of the year.

(1964)

Without technical means of accumulating fodder, as the authors
recognize, pastoralists are of course restricted to the livestock they
can support in poorer rather than favorable seasons. Still, Clark and
Haswell’s conclusion finds some support from Allan. As a rough
conjecture, Allan supposes that East African pastoralists know a
“critical population density” on the order of seven persons per square
mile. But from a series of actual cases, “It would seem that population
densities of surviving pastoral peoples are usually well below this
figure, even in the more favourable of the regions they still occupy”
(Allan, 1965, p. 309).⁷

We seem perilously close to that characteristic failing of
interdisciplinary study—an enterprise which often seems to merit
definition as the process by which the unknowns of one’s own subject
matter are multiplied by the uncertainties of some other science. But
enough said at least to raise doubt about the efficiency of resource
exploitation in the primitive economies.

Underuse of Labor-Power

That the labor forces of primitive communities are also underused is
easier to document, thanks to a greater ethnographic attention.
(Besides, this dimension of primitive underproduction conforms closely
to European prejudices, so that many others besides anthropologists have
noticed it, although the more appropriate deduction from the cultural
differences might have been that Europeans are overworked.) It is only
necessary to keep in mind that the manner by which labor-power is
withheld from production is not everywhere the same. The institutional
modalities vary considerably: from marked cultural abbreviations of the
individual working-life span to immoderate standards of relaxation—or,
what is probably a better understanding of the latter, very moderate
standards of “sufficient work.”

[Figure 2.1 Male Working-Span: Lele and Bushong (after Douglas, 1962, p.
231)]

Figure 2.1 Male Working-Span: Lele and Bushong (after Douglas, 1962, p.
231)

One of the main conclusions of Mary Douglas’s brilliant comparison of
Lele and Bushong economies is that in some societies people work for a
much greater part of their lifetime than in others. “Every-thing the
Lele have or do,” Douglas wrote, “the Bushong have more and can do
better. They produce more, live better as well as populating their
region more densely than the Lele” (1962, p. 211). They produce more
largely because they work more, as demonstrated along one dimension by
the remarkable diagram Douglas presents of male working life span in the
two societies (Figure 2.1). Beginning before age 20 and finishing after
60, a Bushong man is productively occupied almost twice as long as a
Lele, the latter retiring comparatively early from a career that began
well after physical maturity. Without intending to repeat Douglas’s
detailed analysis, some of the reasons might be noted briefly for their
pertinence to the present discussion. One is the Lele practice of
polygyny, which as a privilege of the elders entails for younger men a
considerable postponement of marriage, hence of adult responsibilities.⁸
Moving into the political domain, Douglas’s more general explanations of
the Lele-Bushong contrast strike a note already familiar. But Douglas
carries the analysis to new dimensions. It is not only differences in
political scale or morphology that make one or another system more
effective economically, but the different relations they entail between
the powers that be and the process of production.⁹

Scant use of young adult labor, however, is not characteristic of the
Lele alone. It is not even the exclusive privilege of agricultural
societies. Hunting and gathering do not demand of!Kung Bushmen that
famous “maximum effort of a maximum number of people.” They manage quite
well without the full cooperation of younger men, who are fairly idle
sometimes to the age of 25:

Another significant feature of the composition of the [!Kung Bushmen]
work force is the late assumption of adult responsibility by the
adolescents. Young people are not expected to provide food regularly
until they are married. Girls typically marry between the ages of 15 and
20, and boys about five years later, so that it is not unusual to find
healthy, active teenagers visiting from camp to camp while their older
relatives provide food for them.

(Lee, 1968, p. 36)

This contrast between the indolence of youth and industry of elders may
appear also in a developed political setting, as in centralized African
chiefdoms such as Bemba. Now the Bemba are not markedly polygynous.
Audrey Richards proposes yet another explanation, one that calls to
anthropological mind still other examples:

In pre-European days there was a complete change of ambition between .
.. youth and age. The young boy, under the system of matrilocal marriage
[entailing bride-service in the wife’s family], had no individual
responsibility for gardening. He was expected to cut trees [for making
gardens], but his main way of advance in life was to attach himself to a
chief or to a man of rank and not to make large gardens or to collect
material goods. He often went on border raids or foraging expeditions.
He did not expect to work in earnest until middle age, when his children
were “crying from hunger” and he had settled down. Nowadays we saw in
concrete cases the immense difference between the regularity of work
done by the old and young.¹⁰ This is partly due to the new
insubordination of the boys, but partly also to a perpetuation of an old
tradition. In our society youths and adolescents have, roughly speaking,
the same economic ambitions throughout youth and early manhood. . ..
Among the Bemba this was not so, any more than it was among such warrior
peoples as the Masai of East Africa with their regular age-sets.¹¹ Each
individual was expected to be first a fighter and later a cultivator and
the father of a family.

(Richards, 1961, p. 402)

In sum, for a variety of cultural reasons, the lifetime working span may
be seriously curtailed. Indeed, economic obligations can be totally
unbalanced in relation to physical capacity, the younger and stronger
adults largely disengaged from production, leaving the burden of
society’s work to the older and weaker.

An unbalance to the same effect may obtain in the division of labor by
sex. Half the available labor power may be providing a
disproportionately small fraction of the society’s output. Differences
of this kind are common enough, at least in the subsistence sector, to
have long lent credence to crude materialist explanations of the
customary descent rule, matrilineal or patrilineal, by the specific
economic weight of female versus male labor.

I have myself had ethnographic occasion to observe a marked unbalance in
the sexual division of labor. Excluded from agriculture, the women of
the Fijian island of Moala show much slighter interest than do their men
in main productive activities. True that the women, especially younger
women, maintain the homes, cook, fish periodically, and are charged with
certain crafts. Yet the ease they enjoy by comparison with their sisters
elsewhere in Fiji, where women do cultivate, is enough to credit the
local saying that “in this land, women rest.” One Moalan friend confided
that all they really did was sit around all day and break wind. (This
was a slander; gossip was the more consuming occupation.) The reverse
emphasis, on female labor, is probably more widespread in primitive
communities (exception made for pastoral-ists, where the women often—but
sometimes many of the men too— are not concerned with the daily
husbandry).¹²

One example we have already noted is worth repeating, as it again
concerns hunters, who less than anyone might be thought able to afford
the extravagance of one whole idle sex out of the two usually available.
Yet such are the Hadza that the men pass six months a year (the dry
season) in gambling—effectively inhibiting those who have lost their
metal-tipped arrows from hunting big game the rest of the year (Woodbum,
1968, p. 54).

It is impossible from these few instances to infer an extent, let alone
attribute a universality, to the differential economic engagement by sex
and age. Again I would merely raise a problem, which is also to cast a
doubt on a common presupposition. The problem concerns the composition
of the labor force. This composition is clearly a cultural and not
simply a natural (physical) specification. Clearly too, the cultural and
natural specifications need not correspond. By custom the individual
working career is variously abbreviated or alleviated, and whole classes
of the able-bodied, perhaps the most able-bodied, are exempted from
economic concern. In the event, the disposable working force is
something less than the available labor-power, and the remainder of the
latter is otherwise spent or dissipated. That this diversion of manpower
is sometimes necessary is not contested. It may well be functional, even
inevitable, to the society and economy as organized. But that is the
problem: we have to do with the organized withdrawal of important social
energies from the economic process. Nor is it the only problem. Another
is how much the others, the effective producers, actually do work.

While no anthropologist today would concede the truth of the imperialist
ideology that the natives are congenitally lazy, and many would testify
rather that the people are capable of sustained labor, probably most
would also observe that the motivation to do so is not constant, so that
work is in fact irregular over the longer or shorter term. The work
process is sensitive to interference of various kinds, vulnerable to
suspension in favor of other activities as serious as ritual, as
frivolous as repose. The customary working day is often short; if it is
protracted, frequently it is interrupted; if it is both long and
unremitting, usually this is only seasonal. Within the community,
moreover, some people work much more than others. By the norms of the
society, let alone of the stakhonovite, considerable labor-power remains
underemployed. As Maurice Godelier writes, labor is not a scarce
resource in most primitive societies (1969, p. 32).¹³

In the subsistence sector, a man’s normal working day (in season) may be
as short as four hours, as among the Bemba (Richards, 1961, pp.
398–399), the Hawaiians (Stewart, 1828, p. 111) or the Kuikuru
(Carneiro, 1968, p. 134), or perhaps it is six hours, as for!Kung
Bushmen (Lee, 1968, p. 37) or Kapauku (Pospisil, 1963, pp. 144–145).
Then again, it may last from early to late:

But let us follow a (Tikopian) working party as they leave home on a
fine morning, bound for the cultivations. They are going to dig
turmeric, for it is August, the season for the preparation of this
highly valued sacred dye. The group sets off from the village of
Matautu, straggles along the beach to Rofaea and then turning inland
begins to ascend the path running up to the crest of the hills. The
turmeric plant ... grows on the mountain-side and to reach the orchard .
.. involves a steep climb of several hundred feet ... The party consists
of Pa Nukunefu and his wife, their young daughter, and three older
girls, these latter having been coopted from the households of friends
and neighbors ... Soon after these people arrive they are joined by
Vaitere, a youth whose family owns the neighbouring orchard . .. The
work is of very simple nature ... Pa Nukunefu and the women share the
work fairly among them, he doing most of the clearing of vegetation and
the digging, they some of the digging and replanting, and nearly all the
cleaning and sorting ... the tempo of the work is an easy one. From time
to time members of the party drop out for a rest, and to chew betel. To
this end, Vaitere, who takes no very active part in the work itself,
climbs a nearby tree to collect some leaves of pita, the betel plant....
About mid-morning the customary refreshment is provided in the shape of
green coconuts, for which Vaitere is again sent to climb.. . . The whole
atmosphere is one of labour diversified by recreation at will. . ..
Vaitere, as the morning draws on, busies himself with the construction
of a cap out of banana leaf, his own invention, and of no practical use
So between work and leisure the time passes, until as the sun declines
perceptibly from the zenith the task of the party is done, and bearing
their baskets of turmeric roots they go off down the mountain-side to
their homes.

(Firth, 1936, pp. 92–93)

On the other hand, the daily labors of Kapauku seem more sustained.
Their workday begins about 7:30 a.m. and proceeds fairly steadily until
a late morning break for lunch. The men return to the village in the
early afternoon, but the women continue on until four or five o’clock.
Yet the Kapauku “have a conception of balance in life”: if they work
strenuously one day, they rest the next.

Since the Kapauku have a conception of balance in life, only every other
day is supposed to be a working day. Such a day is followed by a day of
rest in order to “regain the lost power and health.” This monotonous
fluctuation of leisure and work is made more appealing to the Kapauku by
inserting into their schedule periods of more prolonged holidays (spent
in dancing, visiting, fishing, or hunting . . .). Consequently, we
usually find only some of the people departing for their gardens in the
morning, the others are taking their “day off.” However, many
individuals do not rigidly conform to this ideal. The more conscientious
cultivators often work intensively for several days in order to complete
clearing a plot, making a fence, or digging a ditch. After such a task
is accomplished, they relax for a period of several days, thus
compensating for their “missed” days of rest.

(Pospisil, 1963, p. 145)

Following this course of moderation in all things, Kapauku over the long
run allow an unextraordinary amount of time to agriculture. From records
that he kept through an eight-month period (Kapauku cultivation is not
seasonal) and on the assumption of a potential eight-hour day, Pospisil
estimates that Kapauku men spend approximately one-fourth their “working
time” in gardening, the women about one-fifth. More precisely, men
average 2h18m/day in agricultural tasks, the women 1h42m. Pospisil
writes: “These relatively small portions of total working time seem to
cast serious doubt on the claim, so often made, that native cultivation
methods are wasteful, time consuming and economically inadequate”(1963,
p. 164). For the rest, aside from relaxation and “prolonged holidays,”
Kapauku men are more concerned with politicking and exchange than with
other areas of production (crafts, hunting, house building).¹⁴

In their studied habit of one day on, one day off, Kapauku are perhaps
unusual for the regularity of their economic tempo,¹⁵ but not for its
intermittency. A similar pattern was documented in Chapter 1 for
hunters: Australians, Bushmen, and other peoples—their labors
chronically punctuated by days of slack, not to mention sleep. And
notoriously among many agriculturalists of seasonal regime the same
cadence recurs, although on a different time scale. Agricultural
off-seasons are given over as much to relaxation and diversion, to rest,
ceremony and visiting, as they are to other works. Taken over the
extended term, therefore, all these modes of livelihood reveal
themselves unintensive: they make only fractional demands on the
available labor-power.

Fractional use of labor-power is detectable also in the individual
work-diaries sometimes collected by ethnographers. Although these
diaries typically account for only a very few people as well as a very
brief time, they are usually extensive enough to show important domestic
differences in economic effort. At least one of the six or seven people
concerned turns out to be the village indolent (cf. Provinse, 1937;
Titiev, 1944, p. 196). The diaries thus manage to convey a suggestion of
unequal productive commitment, that is to say, a relative
underemployment of some even within the unspectacular conscientiousness
of all. A certain flavor of this pattern, if not an accurate measure, is
provided in Table 2.3, a reproduction of F. Nadel’s journal for three
Nupe farm families (1942, pp. 222–224).¹⁶ The two weeks of observation
fall into different periods of the annual cycle. The second week is a
time of peak intensity.

Audrey Richard’s diaries for two Bemba villages lend themselves to
quantitative assessment. The first and longer, from Kasaka village, is
presented in Table 2.4: it covers the activities of 38 adults over 23
days (September 13–October 5, 1934). This was a season of reduced
agricultural labor, although not the Bemba hungry period. Men engaged in
little or no work for approximately 45 percent of the time. Only half
their days could be classed as productive or working days, of an average
duration of 4.72 hours of labor (but see below, where the figure of 2.75
hours for a working day was apparently calculated on a base of all
available days). Women’s time was more equally divided between working
days (30.3 percent), days of part-time work (35.1 percent) and days of
little or no work (31.7 percent). For both men and women, this
unstrenuous program would be modified during the busier agricultural
season.¹⁷ Table 2.5, representing the work of 33 adults of Kampamba
village over seven to

^(†) The categories 1–4 and classification of data under these rubrics
are my own.

^(‡) Richards specifies that even when remaining in the village, women
do much domestic work; therefore, she rarely uses the category “leisure”
to describe their days, preferring instead “no garden work.” “Leisure”
on the other hand means “a day spent in sitting, talking, drinking, or
doing handicrafts.” I have thus put “no garden work” (as well as “in
village,” “at home” and, for want of further information, “away”) in a
category of “part-time work,” while “leisure” is classed in the category
“days mainly not working.” “Leisure” includes Christian Sundays.

^(§) Richards indicates that “walks” in her table mean “visits to
relatives” unless otherwise specified; I include such “walks” here.

ten days of January 1934, attests to the periodic intensification of
productive tempo.¹⁸

If these tables for the Bemba could be extended over a full year, they
would probably yield results similar to those obtained by Guillard
(1958) for the Toupouri of North Cameroon, shown in Table 2.6 on p.59.¹⁹

And if such systems as the Bemba and Toupouri were plotted graphically
over the year, they would probably resemble the diagrams de Schlippe
accumulated for the Azande—one of these is presented in Figure 2.2 on
p.61.

But work schedules such as these, with their generous reservations of
time to fete and repose, should not be interpreted from the anxious
vantage of European compulsions.²⁰ The periodic deflection from “work”
to “ritual” by peoples such as the Tikopians or Fijians must be made
without prejudice, for their linguistic categories know no such
distinction, but conceive both activities sufficiently serious as to
merit a common term (so the “Work of the Gods”). And what are we to
construe of those Australian Aborigines—the Yir Yiront—who do not
discriminate between “work” and “play” (Sharp, 1958, p. 6)? Perhaps
equally arbitrary are many cultural definitions of inclement weather,
serving as pretext, it seems, for suspending production under conditions
somewhere short of the human capacity for discomfort. Yet it would be
insufficient simply to suppose that production is thus subject to
arbitrary interference: to interruption by other obligations, themselves
“noneconomic” but not by that character unworthy of people’s respect.
These other claims—of ceremony, diversion, sociability and repose—are
only the complement or, if you will, the super-structural counterpart of
a dynamic proper to the economy. They are not simply imposed upon the
economy from without, for there is within, in the way production is
organized, an intrinsic discontinuity. The economy has its own cutoff
principal: it is an economy of concrete and limited objectives.

Consider the Siuai of Bougainville. Douglas Oliver describes in terms by
now familiar how garden work submits to diverse cultural obstructions,
leaving the real output clearly below the possible:

Table 2.6 Distribution of activities over year, Toupouri (after Guillard
1958)^(*)

[]

There is, of course no physical reason why this labor output could not
be increased. There is no serious land-shortage, and a labor
“stretch-out” could be and often is undertaken. Siuai women work hard at
their gardens but not nearly so hard as some Papuan women; it is
conceivable that they could work much longer and harder without doing
themselves physical injury. That is to say, it is conceivable by other
standards of work. Cultural rather than physical factors influence Siuai
standards of “maximum working hours.” Garden work is taboo for long
periods following upon death of a kinsman or friend. Nursing mothers may
spend but a few hours daily away from their babies, who, because of
ritual restrictions, often may not be carried into the gardens. And
aside from these ritual restrictions upon continuous garden work, there
are less spectacular limitations. It is conventional to cease working
during even light showers; it is customary to start for the garden only
after the sun is well up, and to leave for home in midafternoon. Now and
then a married couple will remain in their garden site all night
sleeping in a lean-to, but only the most ambitious and enterprising care
to discomfort themselves thus.

(Oliver, 1949 [3], p. 16)

But in another connection Oliver explains more fundamentally why Siuai
working standards are so modest—because, except for politically
ambitious people, they are sufficient:

As a matter of fact, natives took pride in their ability to estimate
their immediate personal consumption needs, and to produce just enough
taro to satisfy them. I write “personal consumption needs” advisedly,
because there is very little commercial or ritual exchange of taro.
Nevertheless, personal consumption needs vary considerably: there is a
lot of difference between the amount of taro consumed by an ordinary man
with his one or two pigs, and an ambitious social-climber with his ten
or twenty. The latter has to cultivate more and more land in order to
feed his increasing number of pigs and to provide vegetable food for
distribution among guests at his feasts.

(Oliver, 1949 [4], p. 89)

Production has its own constraints. If these are sometimes manifest as
the deployment of labor to other ends, it should not be thus obscured to
the analysis. Sometimes it is not even disguised to observation: as of
certain hunters, for example, who once again become the revelatory case
because they seem to need no excuse to stop working once they have
enough to eat.²¹ All this can be phrased another way: from the point of
view of the existing mode of production, a considerable proportion of
the available labor-power is excess. And the system, having thus defined
sufficiency, does not realize the surplus of which it is perfectly
capable:

There is no doubt at all that the Kuikuru could produce a surplus of
food over the full productive cycle. At the present time a man spends
only about 3–½ hours a day on subsistence—2 hours on horticulture, and
1–½ hours on fishing. Of the remaining 10 or 12 waking hours of the day
the Kuikuru men spend a great deal of it dancing, wrestling, in some
form of informal recreation, and in loafing. A good deal more of this
time could easily be devoted to gardening. Even an extra half hour a day
spent on agriculture would enable a man to produce a substantial surplus
of manioc. However, as conditions stand now there is no reason for the
Kuikuru to produce such a surplus, nor is there any indication that they
will.

3.  Hunting and fishing.
4.  Processing at home of agricultural produce and of produce of
    gathering, including beer brewing, oil and salt making, and so on.
    These four items taken together could be called food production at
    or near home.
5.  Marketing, including cotton markets, as well as weekly food markets,
    either selling or buying, and absences for the purpose of acquiring
    tools, clothes, and other goods in shops or elsewhere.
6.  Other occupations at home, mainly housebuilding and craftsmanship,
    but also repairing, putting things in order, and such like.
7.  Work outside home, including hunting and fishing expeditions, work
    for chief or district, salaried work for Government or E.P.B., and
    work for neighbors in beer parties.
8.  No work for various reasons—including chiefs’ courts, ceremonies and
    rituals, sickness at home, in hospital or at the witchdoctor’s,
    childbirth, rest, and leisure.

The graph does not represent man-days given to various tasks but the
number of days (or percentage of days) the type of activity occurred.

In brief, it is an economy of production for use, for the livelihood of
the producers. Having come to this conclusion, our discussion links up
with established theory in economic history. It also makes connection
with understandings long established in anthropological economics. Firth
had effectively made this point in 1929, when commenting on the
discontinuity of Maori labor in comparison with European tempos and
incentives (1959a, p. 192 f). In the 1940s Gluckman wrote as much about
the Bantu in general and the Lozi in particular (1943, p. 36; cf.
Leacock, 1954, p. 7).

There will be much more to say theoretically about domestic production
for use. For now I rest on the descriptive comment that in primitive
communities an important fraction of existing labor resources may be
rendered excessive by the mode of production.

Household Failure

A third dimension of primitive underproduction, the final one here
considered, is perhaps the most dramatic; at least it is the most
serious for the people concerned. A fair percentage of domestic groups
persistently fail to produce their own livelihood, although organized to
do so. They occupy the lower end of a very large range of variation in
household production, variation in appearance uncontrolled, but
consistently observed in primitive societies of different circumstance,
tradition and location. Once more the evidence is not definitive. But
coupled to the logic of the case, it seems enough to encourage the
following theoretical suggestion: that this variation, notably including
a substantial degree of domestic economic failure, is a constituted
condition of primitive economy.²²

I was myself first struck by the magnitude of household production
differences while working in Fiji, collecting estimates of food
cultivation from the household heads in a number of Moalan villages.
These were mainly estimates, so I cite the results merely as an example
of the anecdotal comment to be found often in the monographic
literature:

Differences in production within any given village are even more
critical than output differences between villages. At least no Moalan
village seems to be starving, whereas it is apparent that some men do
not produce enough food for family needs. At the same time no village
[with one possible exception] appears to have much surfeit, whereas some
families are producing considerably more food than they can consume . ..
familial differences in production of such . .. magnitude occur in every
village and with respect to virtually every staple, secondary, and minor
crop.

(Sahlins, 1962a, p. 59)

C. Daryll Forde’s investigation of yam staple cultivation among 97
families in the Yako village of Umor, shown in Figure 2.3 on p.64, is
more precise, and certainly more graphic. Forde remarks that, although a
representative Yako family of husband, one or two wives and three or
four children will have one and one-half acres of yams under cultivation
each year, 10 of the 97 he sampled were cultivating less than half an
acre and 40 percent between a half and one acre. The same kind of
deficit occurs in the output curve: mean production per house was
2,400–2,500 yams (medium-sized units), but the mode was only 1,900; a
large proportion of families fell toward the lower end of the scale. And
some of those at the lower end were below the customary subsistence
requirement:

It would be . .. incorrect to assume that there are no substantial
variations from household to household in yam consumption. Although
there is probably no gross insufficiency of supply of this staple food,
there are at opposite ends of the scale households which, through
inefficiency, sickness or other misfortune secure much less than they
need by local standards, and others in which the fufu bowl is always
heaped full.

(Forde, 1946, p. 59; cf. p. 64)

The situation depicted in Derek Freeman’s classic study of rice
production among the Iban is yet more serious (Freeman, 1955). But this
example, covering the 25 families of Rumah Nyala village, carries two
important reservations. First, the Iban maintain a considerable trade in
their rice staple with mercantile centers of Sarawak—although in fact
Iban families do not always produce enough for subsistence, let alone a
surplus for export.²³ Secondly, the period of observation, 1949–50, was
an exceptionally bad year. By Freeman’s estimate—approximate, as he
cautions—only eight of the 25 households were able to harvest a normal
consumption quota (including rice for seed, animal feed, ritual expenses
and beer). Table 2.7 summarizes yields in relation to consumption
requirements for 1949–50. In ordinary years this distribution would
probably be inverted, to show a normal rate of household failure on the
order of 20 to 30 percent.

[Figure 2.3 Yam Production, Umor Village, Yakö (after Forde, 1964)]

Figure 2.3 Yam Production, Umor Village, Yakö (after Forde, 1964)

At first sight, the fact that only about one third of bilek families
managed to secure their normal requirements seems surprising, but it
must be remembered that the 1949–50 season was an exceptionally bad one.
. .. Nonetheless, it seems probable that even in normal years it is not
uncommon for a minor percentage of households to fall below the ordinary
level of subsistence as we have defined it. In the absence of reliable
data we can do no more than make an informed guess. From my discussions
with Iban informants, I would expect that in normal years from 70% to
80% of bilek families would attain their ordinary requirements, and that
in favourable seasons virtually all would be successful. . .. There are
probably few, if any, Iban families which have not, at some time or
another, found themselves in straitened circumstances with insufficient
padi for their barest needs.

Another enthnographic example, to some degree making up by its precision
for its modesty of scale, is Thayer Scudder’s study (1962) of cereal
cultivation among the 25 families of Mazulu village, Gwembe Tonga
(Northern Rhodesia). The region is plagued by famine, but the yield of
Mazulu farms is not of present moment; the first question is whether the
several households had planted sufficient acreage to assure their
subsistence. Scudder adduces a figure of one acre/capita as normally
sufficient.²⁴ But as indicated in Table 2.8, presenting the results of
Scudder’s field study, four of the Mazulu households come seriously
short of this level, and altogether 10 of the 20 fail to reach it. The
domestic differences seem distributed as a normal curve around the point
of per capita subsistence.

Enough said? Nothing is more tiresome than an anthropology “among-the”
book: among the Arunta this, among the Kariera that. Nor is anything
scientifically proven by the endless multiplication of examples—except
that anthropology can be boring. But the last proposition does not need
an elaborate demonstration, and neither does the one under discussion.
For certain forms of production, notably hunting and fishing, the
likelihood of differential success is known to common sense and
experience. Besides and more generally, insofar as production is
organized by domestic groups, it is established on a fragile and
vulnerable base. The familial labor force is normally small and often
sorely beset. In any “large enough community” the several households
will show a considerable range in size and composition, range that may
well leave some susceptible to

disastrous mischance. For some must be unfavorably composed in the ratio
of effective workers to dependent nonproducers (mostly children and the
aged). Of course others are in this respect more fortunately balanced,
even overbalanced, on the side of capable producers. Yet any given
family is subject to this kind of variation over time and the domestic
growth cycle, just as at any given time certain families must find
themselves facing economic difficulties. Thus a third apparent dimension
of primitive underproduction: an interesting percentage of households
chronically fail to provide their own customary livelihood.


Elements of the Domestic Mode of Production

The foregoing constitutes a first empirical experience of widespread and
profound tendencies of underproduction in the primitive economies. The
succeeding is a first attempt to explain these tendencies theoretically
by reference to a widespread and profound structure of the economies in
question, the domestic mode of production. Necessarily the analysis will
be as generalized as the phenomena are broadly distributed and variably
expressed, a procedure which demands as an initial task certain
methodological apologies.

Apologies For Generality

In a confrontation with a particular ethnographic case of
underproduction, no abstract explanation can be as satisfactory as an
accounting of the specific forces in play: the existing social and
political relations, rights of property, ritual impediments to the
deployment of labor, and the like.²⁵ But insofar as the several forms of
underproduction noted earlier are generally discovered in the primitive
economies, no particular analysis of them will satisfy either. For then
they belong to the nature of the economies at issue, and in that
capacity must be interpreted from equally general conditions of economic
organization. Such is the analysis attempted here.

Yet the general only exists in particular forms. So the well-known
methodological reservation of a well-known social anthropologist remains
pertinent: what is the use, he asked, of putting into comparison a
society you have not first thoroughly understood? To this a colleague of
mine once replied, as we walked along a dim academic corridor: “How can
you understand a society you have not first compared?” This unhappy
conjuncture of truths seems to leave anthropology in the position of a
railroad engineer in the state of Connecticut, where (I am told) there
is a law on the books to the effect that two trains moving in opposite
directions along parallel tracks must, when they meet, come to a
complete stop, and neither one may start up again until the other has
passed out of sight. Undaunted anthropologists adopt cunning devices to
break the impasse; for example, generalization by means of the “ideal
type.” The “ideal type” is a logical construct founded at once on
pretended knowledge and pretended ignorance of the real diversity in the
world—with the mysterious power of rendering intelligible any particular
case. The solution has a dignity equal to the problem. Perhaps then it
will excuse this chapter, which is written in the genre.

But how to justify certain other tactics even less respectable? From
time to time the discussion will take clear leave of “reality,” ignoring
the apparent facts for what it is pleased to consider “the permanent
fact.” Penetrating beyond kinship, ritual, chieftainship—in sum, the
main institutions of primitive society—it claims to see in the household
system the first principles of economic performance. Yet the domestic
economy cannot be “seen” in isolation, uncompromised by the greater
institutions to which it is always subordinated. And even more
reprehensible than this analytic arrogance, although in a way its
inevitable result, the argument will be discovered on occasion in a
scandalous flirtation with the state of nature—not exactly the latest
anthropological approach. Philosophers who have examined the foundations
of society, Rousseau said, have all felt the need to return to the state
of nature, but none of them ever got there. The master thereupon
proceeded to repeat the failure, but so magnificently this time as to
leave the conviction that it really was useful to speak of things “that
no longer exist, that perhaps never existed, that probably shall never
exist, and yet of which it is necessary to have correct ideas in order
to better judge our present condition.”

But then, even to speak of “the economy” of a primitive society is an
exercise in unreality. Structurally, “the economy” does not exist.
Rather than a distinct and specialized organization, “economy” is
something that generalized social groups and relations, notably kinship
groups and relations, do. Economy is rather a function of the society
than a structure, for the armature of the economic process is provided
by groups classically conceived “noneconomic.” In particular, production
is instituted by domestic groups, these ordinarily ordered as families
of one kind or another. The household is to the tribal economy as the
manor to the medieval economy or the corporation to modern capitalism:
each is the dominant production-institution of its time. Each
represents, moreover, a determinate mode of production, with an
appropriate technology and division of labor, a characteristic economic
objective or finality, specific forms of property, definite social and
exchange relations between producing units— and contradictions all its
own.²⁶ In brief, to explain the observed disposition toward
underproduction in the primitive economies, I would reconstruct the
“independent domestic economy” of Karl Bücher and earlier writers—but
relocated now somewhat chez Marx, and redecorated in a more fashionable
ethnography.

For the domestic groups of primitive society have not yet suffered
demotion to a mere consumption status, their labor power detached from
the familial circle and, employed in an external realm, made subject to
an alien organization and purpose. The household is as such charged with
production, with the deployment and use of labor-power, with the
determination of the economic objective. Its own inner relations, as
between husband and wife, parent and child, are the principal relations
of production in society. The built-in etiquette of kinship statuses,
the dominance and subordination of domestic life, the reciprocity and
cooperation, here make the “economic” a modality of the intimate. How
labor is to be expended, the terms and products of its activity, are in
the main domestic decisions. And these decisions are taken primarily
with a view toward domestic contentment. Production is geared to the
family’s customary requirements. Production is for the benefit of the
producers.

I hasten to add two reservations, which are also two final apologies for
generality.

First, the convenient identification of “domestic group” with “family”
that I allow myself is too loose and imprecise. The domestic group in
the primitive societies is usually a family system, but this is not
always so, and where it is, the term “family” must cover a variety of
specific forms. Households of a community are sometimes morphologically
heterogenous: apart from families, they include other kinds of domestic
units composed, for example, of persons of a given age-class. Again,
although it is also comparatively rare, families may be completely
submerged in domestic groups the dimensions and structure of a lineage.
Where the household is a family system, still the forms vary from
nuclear to extended, and within the latter category from polygynous
through matrilocal, patrilocal, and a variety of other types. Finally,
the domestic group is internally integrated in different manners and
degrees, as may be judged by the patterns of daily cohabitation,
commensality and cooperation. Although the essential qualities of
production to be discussed—dominance of the sexual division of labor,
segmentary production for use, autonomous access to productive means,
centrifugal relations beween producing units— appear to hold across
these formal variations, the proposition of a domestic mode of
production is surely a highly ideal type. And if one is nevertheless
permitted to speak of a domestic mode of production, it is always and
only in summary of many different modes of domestic production.

Secondly, I do not suggest that the household everywhere is an exclusive
work group, and production merely a domestic activity. Local techniques
demand more or less cooperation, so production may be organized in
diverse social forms, and sometimes at levels higher than the household.
Members of one family may regularly collaborate on an individual basis
with kith and kin from other houses; certain projects are collectively
undertaken by constituted groups such as lineages or village
communities. But the issue is not the social composition of work. Larger
working parties are in the main just so many ways the domestic mode of
production realizes itself. Often the collective organization of work
merely disguises by its massiveness its essential social simplicity. A
series of persons or small groups act side by side on parallel and
duplicate tasks, or they labor together for the benefit of each
participant in turn. The collective effort thus momentarily compresses
the segmentary structure of production without changing it permanently
or fundamentally. Most decisive, cooperation does not institute a sui
generis production-structure with its own finality, different from and
greater than the livelihood of the several domestic groups and dominant
in the production process of the society. Cooperation remains for the
most part a technical fact, without independent social realization on
the level of economic control. It does not compromise the autonomy of
the household or its economic purpose, the domestic management of
labor-power or the prevalence of domestic objectives across the social
activities of work.

These apologies offered, I pass to the description of the principal
aspects of the domestic mode of production (DMP), with a view fixed to
the implications of this mode for the character of the economic
performance.

Division of Labor

By its composition, the household makes up a kind of petite economy. In
response to the technical scale and diversity of production, it is even
expandable to a degree: the combination of nuclear elements in some form
of extended family seems to make its debut as the social organization of
an economic complexity. But more important than its size, familial
control of production rests on another aspect of its composition. The
family contains within itself the division of labor dominant in the
society as a whole. A family—it is from the beginning and at the minimum
a man and wife, an adult male and an adult female. Hence, from its
inception a family combines the two essential social elements of
production. Division of labor by sex is not the only economic
specialization known to primitive societies. But it is the dominant
form, transcending all other specialization in this sense: that the
normal activities of any adult man, taken in conjunction with the normal
activities of an adult woman, practically exhaust the customary works of
society. Therefore marriage, among other things, establishes a
generalized economic group constituted to produce the local conception
of livelihood.

The Primitive Relation Between Man and Tool

Here is a second correlation, equally elementary: between the domestic
mode, atomized and small scale, and a technology of similar dimensions.
The basic apparatus can usually be handled by household groups; much of
it can be wielded autonomously by individuals. Other technological
limitations are likewise consistent with the supremacy of the domestic
economy: implements are homespun, thus—as most skills—simple enough to
be widely available; productive processes are unitary rather than
decomposed by an elaborate division of labor, so that the same
interested party can carry through the whole procedure from the
extraction of the raw material to the fabrication of the finished good.

But a technology is not comprehended by its physical properties alone.
In use, tools are brought into specific relationships with their users.
On the largest view, this relationship and not the tool itself is the
determinate historic quality of a technology. No purely physical
difference between the traps of certain spiders and those of certain
(human) hunters, or between the bee’s hive and the Bantu’s, is
historically as meaningful as the difference in the instrument-user
relation. The tools themselves are not different in principle, or even
in efficiency. Anthropologists are only satisfied by the
extratechnological observation that in invention and use the human
instrument expresses “conscious ingenuity” (symboling), the insect’s
tool, inherited physiology (“instinct”)—“what distinguishes the worst
architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his
structure in imagination before he erects it in reality” (Marx, 1967a,
vol. 1, p. 178). Tools, even good tools, are prehuman. The great
evolutionary divide is in the relationship: tool-organism.

The human capacities once achieved, ingenuity in turn loses its
differentiating power. The world’s most primitive peoples—judged as such
on the plane of overall cultural complexity—create unparalled technical
masterpieces. Dismantled and shipped to New York or London, Bushman
traps lie now gathering dust in the basements of a hundred museums,
powerless even to instruct because no one can figure out how to put them
back together again. On a very broad view of cultural evolution,
technical developments have accumulated not so much in ingenuity as
along a different axis of the man-tool relationship. It is a question of
the distribution of energy, skill, and intelligence between the two. In
the primitive relation of man to tool, the balance of these is in favor
of man; with the inception of a “machine age” the balance swings
definitively in favor of the tool.²⁷

The primitive relation between man and tool is a condition of the
domestic mode of production. Typically, the instrument is an artificial
extension of the person, not simply designed for individual use, but as
an attachment that increases the body’s mechanical advantage (for
example, a bow-drill or a spear thrower), or performs final operations
(for example, cutting, digging) for which the body is not naturally well
equipped. The tool thus delivers human energy and skill more than energy
and skill of its own. But the latest technology would invert this
relationship between man and tool. It becomes debatable which is the
tool:

The share of the operative workman in the machine industry is
(typically) that of an attendant, an assistant, whose duty it is to keep
pace with the machine process and to help out with workmanlike
manipulation at points where the machine process engaged is incomplete.
His work supplements the machine process, rather than makes use of it.
On the contrary the machine process makes use of the workman.

(Veblen, 1914, pp. 306–7)²⁸

The theoretical value placed by modern evolutionary anthropology on
technology as such is historically contingent. Man is now dependent on
machines, and the evolutionary future of culture seems to hinge on the
progress of this hardware. At the same time, prehistory is by and large
a record of instruments—as a well-known archaeologist is reputed to have
said, “the people, they’re dead.” These banal truths I think help
explain the analytical privilege often conceded to primitive technology,
perhaps as mistaken however as it is entrenched for its exaggeration of
the importance of tool over skill, and correlatively for its perception
of the progress of man from ape to ancient empire as a series of petty
industrial revolutions initiated by the development of new tools or new
energy sources. For the greater part of human history, labor has been
more significant than tools, the intelligent efforts of the producer
more decisive than his simple equipment. The entire history of labor
until very recently has been a history of skilled labor. Only an
industrial system could survive on the proportion of unskilled workers
as now exists; in a similar case, the paleolithic perishes. And the
principal primitive “revolutions,” notably the neolithic domestication
of food resources, were pure triumphs of human technique: new ways of
relating to the existing energy sources (plants and animals) rather than
new tools or new sources (see Chapter 1). The hardware of subsistence
production may very well decline in the passage from the paleolithic to
the neolithic—even as the output goes up. What is the Melanesian’s
digging stick to the sealing gear of an Alaskan Eskimo? Up to the time
of the true industrial revolution, the product of human labor probably
increased much more in return to the worker’s skill than to the
perfection of his tools.

A discussion of the importance of human techniques is not as tangential
as it might seem to this analysis of the DMP. It helps underwrite a
major theoretical suggestion: that in the archaic societies,
social-political pressure must often present itself the most feasible
strategy of economic development. People are the most malleable as well
as the most important side of the primitive man-tool relationship. Take
into consideration, besides, the ethnographic testimony of
underexploitation: that resources are often not fully turned to account,
but between the actual production and the possibility there remains
considerable room for maneuver. The great challenge lies in the
intensification of labor: getting people to work more, or more people to
work. That is to say, the society’s economic destiny is played out in
its relations of production, especially the political pressures that can
be mounted on the household economy.

But an intensification of labor will have to take a dialectical course,
because many properties of the DMP make it refractory at once to the
exercise of political power and the enlargement of production. Of first
importance is the contentment of the household economy with its own
self-appointed objective: livelihood. The DMP is intrinsically an
anti-surplus system.

Production For Livelihood

The classic distinction between “production for use” (that is, for the
producers) and “production for exchange” was, from the beginning of an
economic anthropology, at least in the Anglo-Saxon countries, interred
in the graveyard of prehistoric concepts. True that Thurnwald had
adopted these concepts to set off the primitive from modern monetary
economies (1932). And nothing could prevent their reincarnation in
various ethnographic contexts (see “Underuse of Labor Power” above). But
when Malinowski (1921) defined the “Tribal Economy” in opposition
(partly) to Bucher’s “Independent Domestic Economy” (1911), the notion
of production for use was effectively put aside before its theoretical
usefulness had been exhausted.

Perhaps the problem was that “production for use” or “independent
domestic economy” could be interpreted two different ways, one of which
proved indefensible—so the other was generally ignored. These phrases
suggest a condition of domestic autarky, untrue for the producing units
of any real society. The households of primitive communities are not
usually self-sufficient, producing all they need and needing all they
produce. Certainly there is exchange. Even aside from the presents given
and received under inescapable social obligations, the people may work
for a frankly utilitarian trade, thus indirectly getting what they need.

Still, it is “what they need”: the exchange, and the production for it,
are oriented to livelihood, not to profits. This is a second rendering
of the classic distinction, and the more fundamental; more fundamental
than a certain exchange is the producer’s relation to the productive
process. It is not merely “production for use” but production for use
value, even through the acts of exchange, and as opposed to the quest
for exchange value. On this reading, the DMP does find a place in the
received categories of economic history. Even with exchange, the
domestic mode is cousin to Marx’s “simple circulation of commodities,”
thus to the celebrated formula C → M → C': the manufacture of
commodities (C) for sale in the market in order to obtain wherewithal
(M, money) for the purchase of other, specific commodities (C'). “Simple
circulation” is of course more pertinent to peasant than to primitive
economies. But like peasants, primitive peoples remain constant in their
pursuit of use values, related always to exchange with an interest in
consumption, so to production with an interest in provisioning. And in
this respect the historical opposite of both is the bourgeois
entrepreneur with an interest in exchange value.

The capitalist process has a different starting point and another
calculus. The “general formula for capital” is the transformation of a
given money sum into more of the same by way of the commodity: M → C →
M', the engagement of labor-power and physical means for the fabrication
of a good whose sale realizes the highest possible return on an original
capital. Livelihood and gain, “production for use” and “production for
exchange” pose thus contrasting finalities of production—and,
accordingly, contrasting intensities of production.

For one is an economic system of determinate and finite objectives while
the other holds out the indefinite goal of “as much as possible.” It is
a difference of quality as well as quantity: in the first place of
quality. Production for livelihood envisions not only a moderate quota
of good things, but these of a specific useful character responding to
the producers’ customary requirements. Yet where the domestic economy
seeks merely to reproduce itself, production for exchange (value) would
constantly exceed itself: in the accumulation of a generalized “wealth.”
It is not the production of goods in particular but of an abstract
“wealth.” And “the sky’s the limit.” By definition, M'≤ M is a failure
of the practice M → C → M'; by competition, M → ∞ is the formula of
success. How sublime, Marx wrote, seems the ancient conception that made
man the objective of production, in comparison with a modern world where
production is the objective of man—and wealth the objective of
production (1967b, vol. 1, p. 450).

To consider but one implication—of which we have already had
ethnographic testimony: work in a system of production for use has
unique possibilities of defining a term. Production is under no
compulsion to proceed to the physical or gainful capacity, but inclined
rather to break off for the time being when livelihood is assured for
the time being. Production for use is discontinuous and irregular, and
on the whole sparing of labor-power. Whereas, in production organized by
and for exchange value:

Le but de travail n’est plus, dès lors, tel produit spécifique ayant des
rapports particuliers avec tel ou tel besoin de l’individu, c’est
l’ar-gent, richesse ayant une forme universelle, si bien que le zèle au
travail de l’individu ne connaît plus de limites: indiffèrent à ses
propres particularités, le travail revêt toutes les formes qui servent
ce but. Le zèle se fait inventif et crée des objets nouveaux pour le
besoin sociale. .. . .

(Marx, 1967b, vol. 1, p. 165)

It is regrettable that Economic Anthropology chose largely to ignore
this distinction between production for use and production for exchange.
Recognition of the difference in productivity between them had served
the study of economic history honorably and well. In a famous case Henri
Pirenne thus explained the decline of agriculture in early medieval
Europe, when the economy was left without outlets by the Arab seizure of
the Mediterranean and lapsed at once from commercial exchange to local
self-sufficiency and from higher to lower productivity:

. .. the regression of agricultural methods is obvious. It was useless
to make the soil yield more than was required to satisfy the needs of
the cultivator, for since the surplus could not be exported it would
neither improve the condition of the tiller of the soil nor increase the
rental value of the land. The farmer was therefore satisfied with a
minimum of care and effort, and agronomic science was allowed to fall
into oblivion, until the possiblity of selling the crops should once
more encourage the owners of the soil to adopt improved and more
lucrative methods. But then the land would begin to be regarded as a
value, and not as a means of subsistence.

(Pirenne, 1955, p. 99)

And now the classic opposition reappears as the “dual economy” of
“underdeveloped” countries. Boeke, author of the principle, describes
the contrast in performance this way:

Another respect in which an Eastern differs from a Western society is
the fact that needs are very limited. This is connected with the limited
development of exchange, with the fact that most people have to provide
for themselves, that families have to be content with what they are able
to produce themselves, so that needs necessarily have to remain modest
in quantity and quality. Another consequence of this is that the
economic motive does not work continuously. Therefore . .. economic
activity is also intermittent. Western economy tends in a diametrically
opposite direction.. . .

(Boeke, 1953, p. 39)

But as witnesses to the colonial confrontation of the two economies,
anthropologists have had the opportunity to experience the historic
difference as an ethnographic event. In obdurate patterns of indigenous
labor and “irrational” responses to prices, they have seen production
for use—in crises, therefore in essence. For the traditional economy of
finite objectives insists on asserting itself even as it is broken and
harnessed to the market. Perhaps that helps explain how the rational
West could live for a very long time with two contradictory prejudices
about the “natives” capacity for work. On the one hand, a vulgar
anthropology was contending the people had to labor constantly just to
survive, given their technical incapacities; on the other hand, it was
only too evident that “the natives are congenitally lazy.” If the first
was a colonialist rationale, the second testifies to a certain
deficiency of the ideology: for some reason it proved necessary to beat
the people into shouldering the white man’s burden. Recruited as
plantation hands, they frequently showed themselves unwilling to work
steadily. Induced to raise a cash crop, they would not react
“appropriately” to market changes: as they were interested mainly in
acquiring specific items of consumption, they produced that much less
when crop prices rose, and that much more when prices fell off. And the
introduction of new tools or plants that increased the productivity of
indigenous labor might only then shorten the period of necessary work,
the gains absorbed rather by an expansion of rest than of output (cf.
Sharp, 1952; Sahlins, 1962a). All these and similar responses express an
enduring quality of traditional domestic production, that it is
production of use values, definite in its aim, so discontinuous in its
activity.

In brief, by this characteristic of DMP—that it is a production of use
values—we return to underproduction, the empirical observation of which
was the beginning of inquiry. The domestic system entertains limited
economic goals, qualitatively defined in the terms of a way of living
rather than quantitatively as an abstract wealth. Work is accordingly
unintensive: intermittent and susceptible to all manner of interruption
by cultural alternatives and impediments ranging from heavy ritual to
light rainfall. Economics is only a part-time activity of the primitive
societies, or else it is an activity of only part of the society.

Otherwise said, the DMP harbors an antisurplus principle. Geared to the
production of livelihood, it is endowed with the tendency to come to a
halt at that point. Hence if “surplus” is defined as output above the
producers’ requirements, the household system is not organized for it.
Nothing within the structure of production for use pushes it to
transcend itself. The entire society is constructed on an obstinate
economic base, therefore on a contradiction, because unless the domestic
economy is forced beyond itself the entire society does not survive.
Economically, primitive society is founded on an anti-society.

Chayanov's Rule

There is a more exact way of appreciating this unintensive use of
productive forces. I offer a mixed series of theoretical and statistical
reflections mounting to the conclusion that the domestic system sets
norms of livelihood limited not only absolutely but in relation to the
society’s potential; that indeed, in the community of domestic producing
groups, the greater the relative working capacity of the household the
less its members work. The last is a capital discovery of A. V.
Chayanov, here acknowledged by calling it “Chayanov’s rule.”

A preliminary understanding is that the three elements of the DMP so far
identified—small labor force differentiated essentially by sex, simple
technology, and finite production objectives—are systematically
interrelated. Not only is each in reciprocal bond with the others, but
each by its own modesty of scale is adapted to the nature of the others.
Let any one of these elements show an unusual inclination to develop, it
meets from the others the increasing resistance of an incompatibility.
The normal systematic resolution of this tension is restoration of the
status quo (“negative feedback”). Only in the event of an historic
conjuncture of additional and external contradictions
(“overdetermination”) would the crisis pass over into destruction and
transformation. Specifically, the norm of domestic livelihood tends to
be inert. It cannot move above a certain level without testing the
capacities of the domestic labor force, either directly or through the
technological change required for a higher output. The standard of
livelihood does not substantially increase without putting into question
the existing family organization. And it has an ultimate ceiling set by
the possibility of any household order to provide adequate forces and
relations of production. So long, therefore, as the domestic mode
prevails, the customary idea of livelihood will be suitably restrained.

Moreover, if the internal contradictions set off by rising standards
thus define an absolute limit, the external contradictions will
determine an equilibrium which is low relative to the society’s economic
capacities.

Because, whatever the nature of social relations between households,
from the anarchy of nature to the amity of kinship, the customary norm
of welfare has to be fixed at a level attainable by the larger number of
them, leaving underexploited the powers of the most efficient minority.
Potentially, the several households of a community differ greatly in per
capita output, if only because they are at different stages of the
familial development cycle, so must vary in their ratio of effective
producers to dependent children and elders. But suppose the conventions
of domestic well-being were adapted to the households of greatest
working capacity. Society is then faced with one of two intolerable
conditions, depending on the proximity of existing inter-household
relations to the poles of anarchy and solidarity. No relations
prevailing (or hostile relations), the success of only a few and the
inevitable failure of the many is an economic invitation to violence.
Or, given an extensive kinship, distribution by the happy few in favor
of the many poor merely creates a general and permanent discrepancy
between the convention of domestic welfare and the reality.

Taking together then these abstract and preliminary reasonings: on pain
of engaging internal and external contradictions, revolution and war, or
at least continuous sedition, the customary economic targets of the DMP
have to be held within certain limits, these inferior to the overall
capacity of the society, and wasteful particularly of the labor-power of
more effective households.

“In the family farm,” writes A. V. Chayanov, “rates of labor intensity
are considerably lower than if labor were fully utilized. In all areas
investigated, farm families possess considerable stocks of unused time”
(1966, pp. 75–76). This observation, summing up extensive research on
Russian agriculture of the immediate prerevolutionary period, allows us
to continue the argument in an entirely different register without
missing an essential beat. True that Chayanov and his coworkers
developed their theory of precapitalist domestic economy in the special
context of simple commodity circulation.²⁹ Yet, paradoxically, a
fragmented peasant economy may more clearly than any primitive community
present on the empirical level certain profound tendencies of the DMP.
In the primitive case these tendencies are concealed and transfigured by
general social relations of solidarity and authority. But the peasant
domestic economy, articulated rather to the market by exchange than to
other households by corporate kinship, without pretence manifests to
inspection the deep structure of the DMP. It manifests in particular an
underuse of labor-power, as many of Chayanov’s tables testify. Table 2.9
(p.82) is typical.

Chayanov moved beyond the mere observation of a general underuse of
manpower. He investigated in detail the variation in intensity by
household. Bringing to bear a study of his own among 25 Volokolamsk farm
families, he was able to show, first, that these differences are quite
remarkable: a threefold range of variation from 78.8 working
days/worker/year in the least industrious household to 216.0 working
days per worker in the most industrious.³⁰ Then, most revealing,
Chayanov plotted the differences in intensity/household against
variations in domestic composition figured in terms of number of
consumers. A ratio of household size to effective manpower (dependency
ratio), the last is essentially an index of household economic strength
in relation to its appointed tasks of livelihood. The relative working
capacity of the domestic group can be understood to increase as the
index descends towards unity. Chayanov demonstrates (Table 2.10, p. 83)
that the intensity of labor in the domestic group decreases accordingly.

Chayanov’s demonstration might seem a superfluous refinement of the
obvious, particularly if the domestic economy of finite objectives is
taken for granted. All it says statistically is what one would then
expect logically; namely, the smaller the relative proportion of workers
the more they must work to assure a given state of domestic well-being,
and the greater the proportion the less they work. Phrased more
generally, however, and in a way that says nothing about the finality of
the DMP except by the invitation to comparison with other economies,
Chayanov’s rule suddenly seems magnified several theoretical powers:
Intensity of labor in a system of domestic production for use varies
inversely with the relative working capacity of the producing unit.

Productive intensity is inversely related to productive capacity. The
rule of Chayanov felicitously summarizes and supports several
propositions we had made along the way. It confirms the deduction that
the norm of livelihood does not adapt to maximum household efficiency
but settles rather at a level within reach of the majority, so wasting a
certain potential among the most effective. At the same time, this means
that no compulsion to surplus output is

built into the DMP. But then, the plight of the least effective domestic
groups, especially the substantial percentage that do not meet their own
requirements, seems all the more serious. For the households of greater
working capacity are not automatically extending themselves on behalf of
the poorer. Nothing in the organization of production itself provides
systematic compensation for its own systematic defects.

Property

On the contrary, rather than producing for others, a certain autonomy in
the realm of property strengthens each household’s devotion to its own
interests.

We need not be so fascinated with “title” to property as with
entitlement, nor with abstract claims of “ownership” so much as real
privileges of use and disposition. A stockholder in A.T. &T. believed
himself endowed by his five shares to chop down a telephone pole placed
noxiously in front of his picture window. Anthropologists have likewise
learned by experience to separate various rights of property— income,
use, control—inasmuch as these may be divided among different holders in
the same thing. Also we have proved tolerant enough to recognize
separate rights that are not exclusive by nature but differ mainly in
the power of one holder to override decisions of the other: ranked
overrights, as between a chief and his followers; or segmentary
overrights, as between a corporate lineage and its constituent
households. The path of anthropological progress is now strewn with
terminological corpses, the ghosts of most of which are better avoided.
The issue of present concern is the privileged position of domestic
groups, whatever the coexisting tenures.

For these coexisting tenures are typically superposed to the family
rather than interposed between the family and its means of production.
In the event, the higher “owners” in the primitive societies— chiefs,
lineages, clans—stand in a relation of the second degree to production,
as mediated by the entrenched domestic groups. Chiefly ownership—“of the
land, the sea and the people,” as the Fijians say—is a particularly
revealing case. It is an “ownership” more inclusive than exclusive, and
more political than economic: a derived claim on the product and
productive means in virtue of an inscribed superiority over the
producers. In this it differs from a bourgeois ownership that confers
control over the producers by a claim upon productive means. Whatever
the resemblances in ideology of “ownership,” the two systems of property
work differently, the one (chieftainship) a right to things realized
through a hold on persons, the other (bourgeois) a hold on persons
realized through a right to things.³¹

[]

The household in the tribal societies is usually not the exclusive owner
of its resources: farmlands, pastures, hunting or fishing territories.
But across the ownership of greater groups or higher authorities, even
by means of such ownership, the household retains the primary relation
to productive resources. Where these resources are undivided, the
domestic group has unimpeded access; where the land is allotted, it has
claim to an appropriate share. The family enjoys the usufruct, it is
said, the use-right, but all the privileges entailed are not obvious
from the term. The producers determine on a day-to-day basis how the
land shall be used. And to them falls the priority of appropriation and
disposition of the product; no claim of any supervening group or
authority legitimately goes so far as to deprive the household of its
livelihood. All this is undeniable and irreducible: the right of the
family as a member of the proprietary group or community to directly and
independently exploit for its own support a due share of the social
resources.

As an economic rule, there is no class of landless paupers in primitive
society. If expropriation occurs it is accidental to the mode of
production itself, a cruel fortune of war for instance, and not a
systematic condition of the economic organization. Primitive peoples
have invented many ways to elevate a man above his fellows. But the
producers’ hold on their own economic means rules out the most
compelling history has known: exclusive control of such means by some
few, rendering dependent the many others. The political game has to be
played on levels above production, with tokens such as food and other
finished goods; then, usually the best move, as well as the most coveted
right of property, is to give the stuff away.

Pooling

The domestic segregation constructed into production and property is
completed by an inner-directed circulation of the household product. An
inevitable consequence of production at once specialized by sex and
oriented to collective use, this centripetal movement of goods
differentiates the household economy from the world even as it
reiterates the group’s internal solidarity. The effect is magnified
where distribution takes the form of eating together, in a daily ritual
of commensality that consecrates the group as a group. Usually the
household is a consumption unit in this way. But at the least,
householding demands some pooling of goods and services, placing at the
disposition of its members what is indispensable to them. On one hand,
then, the distribution transcends the reciprocity of functions, as
between man and woman, upon which the household is established. Pooling
abolishes the differentiation of the parts in favor of the coherence of
the whole; it is the constituting activity of a group. On the other
hand, the household is thereby distinguished forever from others of its
kind. With these other houses, a given group might eventually entertain
reciprocal relations. But reciprocity is always a “between” relation:
however solidary, it can only perpetuate the separate economic
identities of those who so exchange.

Lewis Henry Morgan called the program of the domestic economy “communism
in living.” The name seems apposite, for householding is the highest
form of economic sociability: “from each according to his abilities and
to each according to his needs”—from the adults that with which they are
charged by the division of labor; to them, but also to the elders, the
children, the incapacitated, regardless of their contributions, that
which they require. The sociological precipitate is a group with an
interest and destiny apart from those outside and a prior claim on the
sentiments and resources of those within. Pooling closes the domestic
circle; the circumference becomes a line of social and economic
demarcation. Sociologists call it a “primary group”; people call it
“home.”

Anarchy and Dispersion

Considered in its own terms, as a structure of production, the DMP is a
species of anarchy.

The domestic mode anticipates no social or material relations between
households except that they are alike. It offers society only a
constituted disorganization, a mechanical solidarity set across the
grain of a segmentary decomposition. The social economy is fragmented
into a thousand petty existences, each organized to proceed
independently of the others and each dedicated to the homebred principle
of looking out for itself. The division of labor? Beyond the household
it ceases to have organic force. Instead of unifying society by
sacrificing the autonomy of its producing groups, the division of labor
here, as it is principally a division of labor by sex, sacrifices the
unity of society to the autonomy of its producing groups. Nor is any
higher cause entertained by the household’s access to productive
resources, or again by the economic priorities codified in domestic
pooling. Viewed politically, the DMP is a kind of natural state. Nothing
within this infrastructure of production obliges the several household
groups to enter into compact and cede each one some part of its
autonomy. As the domestic economy is in effect the tribal economy in
miniature, so politically it underwrites the condition of primitive
society—society without a Sovereign. In principle each house retains, as
well as its own interests, all the powers that are wanted to satisfy
them. Divided thus into so many units of self-concern, functionally
uncoordinated, production by the domestic mode has all the organization
of the so many potatoes in a certain famous sack of potatoes.

That is in essence the primitive structure of production. But of course
not in appearance. In appearance, primitive society is a poor likeness
of primordial incoherence. Everywhere the petty anarchy of domestic
production is counterposed by larger forces and greater organization,
institutions of social-economic order that join one house to another and
submit all to a general interest. Still, these grand forces of
integration are not given in the dominant and immediate relations of
production. On the contrary, precisely as they are negations of domestic
anarchy, they owe part of their meaning and existence to the disorder
they would suppress. And if in the end anarchy is banished from the
surface of things, it is not definitively exiled. It continues, a
persistent disarray lurking in the background, so long as the household
remains in charge of production.

Here, then, I appeal the apparent facts to the permanent fact. “In the
background” is a discontinuity of power and interest, lending itself
moreover to a dispersion of people. In the background is a state of
nature.

Interesting that almost all the philosophers who have felt the need to
go back there—granted not one of them ever made it— saw in that
condition a specific distribution of population. Almost all sensed some
centrifugal tendency. Hobbes sent back ethnographic report that the life
of man was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. Underline (for
once) the “solitary.” It was a life apart. And the same notion of
original isolation appears ever and again, from Herodutus to K. Bucher,
in the schemes of those who dared speculate on man in nature. Rousseau
took several positions, the most pertinent to our purpose in the Essai
sur l’origine des langues.³² In the earliest times the only society was
the family, the only laws, of nature, and the only mediator between men,
force—in other words, something like the domestic mode of production.
And this “barbaric” epoch was, for Rousseau, the golden age,

not because men were united, but because they were separated. Each one,
it is said, considered himself master of everything; that could be: but
no one knew of nor coveted more than he had in hand; his needs, far from
bringing him nearer his fellows, drove him away. Men, if you will,
attacked each other upon meeting, but they rarely met. Everywhere
reigned the state of war, and all the earth was at peace.

(translation mine)

Maximum dispersion is the settlement pattern of the state of nature. To
understand what conceivable significance this can promise the present
analysis—that is, supposing the reader has not already abandoned the
effort to its apparent folly—it is necessary to ask why the political
philosophers thus rendered natural man far-flung and for the most part
alone. The obvious answer is that the sages posited nature by a simple
opposition to culture, stripped then of everything artificial, which is
nothing less than society. The residue could only be man in isolation—or
perhaps man in the family, that concord of natural lust, as Hobbes
called it—even if the man in question was really the rugged individual
become now so common in society that he claimed to be only natural.
(“L’état de nature, c’est le bourgeois sans société.”) But beyond the
obvious, this conception of a scattered distribution was also a logical
and functionalist deduction, a reflection upon the necessary deployment
of men supposing the natural rather than the political state were in
effect. Where the right to proceed by force is held generally rather
than monopolized politically, there discretion is the better part of
valor and space the surest principle of security. Minimizing conflict
over resources, goods, and women, dispersal is the best protector of
persons and possessions. In other words, this division of force that the
philosophers imagined forced them also to imagine a humanity divided,
putting the greatest distance between one another just as a kind of
functional precaution.

I am at the most abstract, the most hypothetical, in brief, the wildest
point of speculation: that the deeper structure of the economy, the
domestic mode of production, is like the state of nature, and the
characteristic movement of the latter is also its own. Left to its own
devices, the DMP is inclined toward a maximum dispersion of homesteads,
because maximum dispersion is the absence of interdependence and a
common authority, and these are by and large the way production is
organized. If within the domestic circle the decisive motions are
centripetal, between households they are centrifugal, spinning off into
the thinnest probable distribution—an effect proceeding in reality to
the extent it is not checked by greater institutions of order and
equilibrium.

This is so extreme that I must cite some possibility of its ethnographic
relevance, even at the cost of recapitulating known facts and
anticipating later arguments. Carneiro, as we had seen earlier, took
some care to show that villages of the Amazon Tropical Forest are
typically inferior to the 1,000 or even 2,000 inhabitants they might
sustain on existing agricultural practices. He rejects, therefore, the
usual explanation of small village size, to wit, that it is due to
shifting cultivation:

I would like to argue that a factor of greater importance has been the
ease and frequency of village fissioning for reasons not related to
subsistence [that is, to techniques of subsistence]. . .. The facility
with which this phenomenon occurs suggests that villages may seldom get
a chance to increase in population to the point at which they begin to
press hard on the carrying capacity of the land. The centrifugal forces
that cause villages to break apart seem to reach a critical point well
before this happens. What the forces are that lead to village fission
falls outside the present discussion. Suffice it to say that many things
may give rise to factional disputes within a society, and that the
larger the community the more frequent these disputes are likely to be.
By the time a village in the Tropical Forest attains a population of 500
or 600 the stresses and strains within it are probably such that an open
schism, leading to the hiving off of a dissident faction, may easily
occur. If internal political controls were strong, a large community
might succeed in remaining intact despite factionalism. But
chieftainship was notoriously weak among most Amazonian villages, so
that the political mechanisms for holding a growing community together
in the face of increasingly strong divisive forces were all but lacking.

(Carneiro, 1968, p. 136)

My point is that primitive society is founded on an economic
disconformity, a segmentary fragility that lends itself to and
reverberates particular local causes of dispute, and in the absence of
“mechanisms for holding a growing community together” realizes and
resolves the crisis by fission. We have noticed that the domestic mode
of production is discontinuous in time; here we see it is also
discontinuous in space. And as the former discontinuity accounts for a
certain underuse of labor, the latter implies a persistent
underexploitation of resources. Our very roundabout and theoretical tour
of the domestic mode of production thus comes back to its empirical
point of departure. Constituted on an uncertain household base, which is
in any case restrained in material objectives, stinted in its use of
labor power and cloistered in relation to other groups, the domestic
mode of production is not organized to give a brilliant performance.



3 THE DOMESTIC MODE OF PRODUCTION: INTENSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION


Clearly the domestic mode of production can only be “a disarray lurking
in the background,” always present and never happening. It never really
happens that the household by itself manages the economy, for by itself
the domestic stranglehold on production could only arrange for the
expiration of society. Almost every family living solely by its own
means sooner or later discovers it has not the means to live. And while
the household is thus periodically failing to provision itself, it makes
no provision (surplus) either for a public economy: for the support of
social institutions beyond the family or of collective activities such
as warfare, ceremony, or the construction of large technical
apparatus—perhaps just as urgent for survival as the daily food supply.
Besides, the inherent underproduction and underpopulation posed by the
DMP can easily condemn the community to the role of victim in the
political arena. The economic defects of the domestic system are
overcome, or else the society is overcome.

The total empirical process of production is organized then as a
hierarchy of contradictions. At base, and internal to the domestic
system, is a primitive opposition between “the relations” and “the
forces”: domestic control becomes an impediment to development of the
productive means. But this contradiction is reduced by imposing upon it
another: between the household economy and the society at large, the
domestic system and the greater institutions in which it is inscribed.
Kinship, chieftainship, even the ritual order, whatever else they may
be, appear in the primitive societies as economic forces. The grand
strategy of economic intensification enlists social structures beyond
the family and cultural superstructures beyond the productive practice.
In the event, the final material product of this hierarchy of
contradictions, if still below the technological capacity, is above the
domestic propensity.¹

The foregoing announces the overall theoretical line of our inquiry, the
perspectives opened up by analysis of the DMP. At the same time, it
suggests the course of further discussion: the play of kinship and
politics on production. But to avoid a sustained discourse on
generalities, to give some promise of applicability and verification, it
is necessary first to attempt some measure of the impact of concrete
social systems upon domestic production.


On a Method for Investigating the Social Inflection of Domestic Production

Given a system of household production for use, theory says that the
intensity of labor per worker will increase in direct relation to the
domestic ratio of consumers to workers (Chayanov’s rule).² The greater
the relative number of consumers, the more each producer (on average)
will have to work to provide an acceptable per capita output for the
household as a whole. Fact, however, has already suggested certain
violations of the rule, if only because domestic groups with relatively
few workers are especially liable to falter. In these households, labor
intensity falls below the theoretical expectation. Yet more
important—because it accounts for some of the domestic default, or at
least for its acceptability—the real and overall social structure of the
community does not for its own part envision a Chayanov slope of
intensity, if only because kin and political relations between
households, and the interest in others’ welfare these relations entail,
must impel production above the norm in certain houses in a position to
do so. That is to say, a social system has a specific structure and
inflection of household labor intensity, deviating in a characteristic
way and extent from the Chayanov line of normal intensity.

I offer two extended illustrations, from two quite different societies,
to suggest that the Chayanov deviation can be depicted graphically and
calculated numerically. In principle, with a few statistical data not
difficult to collect in the field, it should be possible to construct an
intensity profile for the community of households, a profile that
indicates notably the amount and distribution of surplus labor. In other
words, by the variation in domestic production, it should be possible to
determine the economic coefficient of a given social system.

The first example returns to Thayer Scudder’s study of cereal production
in the Valley Tonga village of Mazulu. This study was considered earlier
in connection with domestic differences in subsistence production
(Chapter 2). Table 3.1 presents the Mazulu materials in fuller form and
in a different arrangement now including the number of consumers and
gardeners by household and the domestic indices of labor composition
(consumers/gardeners) and labor intensity (acres/ gardener). The Mazulu
data offer no direct measure of labor intensity, such as the actual
hours people work; intensity has to be understood indirectly by the
surface cultivated per worker. Immediately an error of some unknown
degree is introduced, since the effort expended/acre is probably not the
same for all gardeners. Moreover, in the attempt to account for the
fractional dietary requirements and labor contributions of different sex
and age classes, some estimates had to be made, as a detailed census is
not available and the population breakdown in Scudder’s production
tables (1962, Appendix B) is not entirely specific. Insofar as possible,
I apply the following rough and apparently reasonable formula for
assessing consumption requirements: taking the adult male as standard
(1.00), preadolescent children are computed as 0.50 consumers and adult
women as 0.80 consumers.³ (This is why the consumer column yields a
figure less than the total household size, and usually not a whole
number.) Finally, adjustments had to be made for calculation of the
domestic labor force. A few very small plots appearing in Scudder’s
table were evidently the work of

Table 3.1 Household variations in intensity of labor: Mazulu Village,
Valley Tonga, 1956-57 (after Scudder, 1962, pp. 258-261)

[]

[]

quite young persons; probably these were training plots in the charge of
younger adolescents. Gardeners listed by Scudder as cultivating less
than 0.50 acres and belonging to the youngest generation of the family
are thus counted as 0.50 workers.

Manifestly, I must insist on the illustrative character of the Mazulu
example. In addition to the several errors potentially introduced by
one’s own manipulations, the very small numbers involved—there are only
20 households in the community—cannot inspire a grand statistical
confidence. But as the aim is merely to suggest a feasibility and not to
prove a point, these several deficiencies, while surely regrettable, do
not seem fatal.⁴

What then do the Mazulu materials illustrate? For one, that Chayanov’s
rule holds—in a general way. That the rule holds in general, although
not in detail, is evident by inspection of the final columns of Table
3.1. The acreage cultivated/gardener mounts in rough relation to the
domestic index of consumers/gardener. A procedure like Chayanov’s own
would show the same, with a little more exactness. Following Chayanov’s
methods, Table 3.2 groups the variation in acreage/worker by regular
intervals of the consumer/worker index:

Table 3.2 Household variations in acreage/gardener: Mazulu^(*)

[]

The results are fairly comparable to those Chayanov and his coworkers
found for peasant Russia. Yet the Mazulu table also betrays the rule.
Clearly the relation between labor intensity and the household ratio of
workers is neither consistent nor proportionate over the entire range.
Individual houses deviate more or less radically, but not altogether
randomly, from the general trend. And the trend itself does not develop
evenly: it takes on an irregular curvature, a specific pattern of rise
and fall.

[Figure 3.1 Mazulu: Trend and Variation in Household Labor Intensity]

Figure 3.1 Mazulu: Trend and Variation in Household Labor Intensity

All this trend and variation can be plotted on a single graph. The
scatter of points in Figure 3.1 represents the distribution of household
differences in labor intensity. Each house is fixed relative to the
horizontal (X) axis by its ratio of consumers/gardener, and along the
vertical (Y) axis by the acreage cultivated/gardener (cf. Table 3.1). A
midpoint to this variation, a kind of average household, can be
determined at X = 1.52 (c/w), Y = 2.16 (a/w). The overall average
tendency of household differences in intensity is then calculable by
deviations from this mean, that is, as a linear regression computed
according to standard formula.⁵ The result for Mazulu, the real
intensity slope of the community, amounts to an increase of 0.52
acres/worker (Y) for each additional 1.00 in the ratio of consumers to
workers (X), but artificially so. The broken line (D) of Figure 3.1
seeks out the truer course of variation, the important propensity to
depart from a linear relation between intensity and composition. This
line, the real intensity curve, is constructed after the mean
intensities (columnar means) of 0.20 intervals in the consumers/worker
ratio. Note that the curve would have taken a somewhat different path if
plotted from the values of Table 3.2. But with so few cases at hand, 20
households, it is difficult to say which version is more valid.
Statistical intuition might hold that with more instances the Mazulu
curve would be sigmoidal (an [] curve), or perhaps concave upward to the
right in exponential fashion. Both of these patterns, and others
besides, occur in Chayanov's own tables. What seems more important,
however, and consistent with accomplished understandings, is that the
variation in labor intensity increases toward both extremes of the c/w
range, disturbing or even reversing the more regular incline of the
medial section. For at the extremes of household composition, Chayanov's
rule becomes vulnerable to contradiction. On one side are households
weak in manpower and subject to one or another crippling malchance.
(Household J in the Mazulu series, represented by the point furthest
right, is an instance in question: a woman widowed at the beginning of
the cultivation period and left to support three preadolescent
children.) On the other side, the decline of the intensity curve to the
left is arrested at some moment because certain domestic groups well
endowed in workers are functioning beyond their own necessity. From that
point of view (that is, of their own customary requirements), they are
working at surplus intensities.

But the surplus output is not exactly indicated by the foregoing
procedure. For this it is necessary to construct a slope of normal
intensity, drawn as much from theory as from reality: a slope describing
the variation in labor that would be required to supply each household
the customary livelihood, supposing each were left to provision itself.
It is necessary, in other words, to project the domestic mode of
production as if unimpeded by the larger structures of society. The
performance to which the DMP as such is disposed, this line of normal
intensity might also then be deemed the true Chayanov slope, for it
represents the most rigorous statement of the Chayanov rule. Insofar as
it is predicated on production to a definite and customary goal,
Chayanov’s rule does not admit just any proportionate relation between
intensity and relative working capacity. In principle it stipulates
strictly the slope of this relation: the domestic intensity of labor
must increase by a factor of the customary consumption requirement for
every increase of 1.00 in the domestic ratio of consumers to workers.
Only in that event will the same (normal) output per capita be achieved
by each household, regardless of its particular composition. This, then,
is the intensity function that conforms to the theory of domestic
production—as the deviation from it in actual practice conforms to the
character of the larger society.

How do we determine the true Chayanov slope for Mazulu? According to
Scudder, 1.00 acres under cultivation per capita should yield an
acceptable subsistence. But “per capita” here applies indiscriminately
to men, women and children. As by our earlier computation the village
population of 123 reduces to 86.20 full consumers (adult male standard),
each consumer of account will demand 1.43 acres for a normal
subsistence. The true Chayanov slope is therefore a straight line
departing from the origin of both dimensions and rising 1.43
acres/gardener for every increase of 1.00 in the domestic ratio of
consumers to workers.

Before proceeding to measure real deviations from this slope, some
decision has to be taken between alternative formulations of the
Chayanov rule, as this has a practical bearing on the representation of
normal intensity. Most of the preceding discussion has been content to
refer to intensity rising with the relative number of consumers. Yet the
law of Chayanov is just as well expressed as an inverse relation between
domestic intensity and the relative number of producers; that is, the
fewer the producers to consumers, the more each will have to work.
Logically, the two propositions are symmetrical. But sociologically,
perhaps not. The first seems to better express the operative
constraints, the burdens imposed upon able-bodied producers by the
dependents they must feed. Probably that is why Chayanov in effect
preferred the direct formulation, and I shall continue to do so.⁶

In Figure 3.2, then, the Chayanov line (C) rises upward to the right,
intensity increasing with the relative number of consumers by the
calculated factor of 1.43 a/w per 1.00 c/w. The line threads its way
through a scatter of points. Once more these stand for the de facto
household differences in labor intensity. But in juxtaposition to the
true Chayanov slope, their meaning is transformed: They tell now of the
modification imparted to domestic production by the greater organization
of society. This modification is summarized also by the deviation of the
real intensity slope (I) from the Chayanov, insofar as the former—0.52
a/w for each 1.00 c/w from the means of intensity and
composition—represents a reduction of household production differences
to their main drift. The positioning of these lines, their manner of
intersection within the range of known domestic variations, makes a
profile specific to that community of the societal transformation of
domestic production (Figure 3.2).

The Mazulu profile can be sharpened and certain of its configurations
measured. The empirical production slope (I) passes upward to the left
of the Chayanov intensity (C), to an important extent because certain
households, among them many with favorable manpower resources, are
cultivating above their own requirements. They are working at surplus
intensities, not simply for their own use, because they are included in
a social system of production, not simply a domestic system. They
contribute to the larger system surplus domestic labor.

[Figure 3.2 Mazulu: Empirical and Chayanov Slopes of Labor Intensity]

Figure 3.2 Mazulu: Empirical and Chayanov Slopes of Labor Intensity

Eight of the 20 Mazulu producing groups are so engaged in extraordinary
efforts, as shown in Table 3.3. Their own average manpower structure is
1.36 consumers/worker, and their mean intensity 2.40 acres/gardener. Let
us mark this point of mean surplus labor, point S, on the Mazulu profile
(Figure 3.2). Its coordinates express the Mazulu strategy of economic
intensification. The vertical distance of S over the slope of normal
intensity (segment ES) constitutes the mean impulse to surplus labor
among productive houses: 0.46 acres/worker or 23.60 percent (as normal
intensity at 1.36 c/w is 1.94 a/w). There are 20.50 effective producers
in these houses, or 35.60 of the village labor force. Thus 40 percent of
the domestic producing groups, comprising 35.60 percent of the working
force, are functioning at a mean of 23.60 percent above the normal
intensity of labor. So for the Y-value of S.

The X coordinate of the surplus impulse (S) will by its relation to mean
household composition (M) provide an indication of how the
intensification tendency is distributed in the community (Figure 3.2).
The further S falls to the left of the mean composition (X = 1.52 c/w),
the more surplus labor is a function of higher proportions of workers in
the domestic group. A position of S nearer the mean, however, indicates
a more general participation in surplus labor: further still to the
right, S would imply an unusual economic activity in households of
lesser labor capacity. For Mazulu, the mean surplus impulse (S) is
clearly left of the village mean. Six of the eight houses functioning at
surplus intensities are below average in their ratios of consumers/
worker. For all eight, the mean composition is lower than the community
average by 0.16 c/w or 10.50 percent.

Finally it is possible from the materials on hand (Tables 3.1 and 3.3)
to compute the contribution of surplus (domestic) labor to the total
village product. This is done by first calculating the sum of surplus
acreage in the several houses producing above normal intensity (number
of workers multiplied by the rate of surplus labor for the eight
relevant cases). The output thus attributable to surplus labor is 9.21
acres. The total cultivations of Mazulu amount to 120.24 acres. Hence,
7.67 percent of the total village output is the product of surplus
labor.

It has to be emphasized that “surplus labor” applies strictly to the
domestic groups, and that it is “surplus” in relation to their normal
consumption quota. Mazulu village as a whole does not show a surplus
expenditure of labor. It is testimony rather to the character and
relative ineffectiveness of the existing social strategy that the total
acreage cultivated falls slightly below village requirements. (Thus at
the point of mean household composition [1.52 c/w],the empirical
inflection

of production [I] passes under the true Chayanov slope [C].) A
nonproductive class could not live on the output of the Mazulu
villagers— at least not without substantial contradiction and potential
conflict.

The mathematical reason for village underproduction is obvious. If some
domestic groups are functioning above normal intensity, others are
working below, to the extent that village output is on balance slightly
negative. But this distribution is not accidental. On the contrary, the
entire production profile should be understood as an integrated social
system in its projection of normal domestic intensity as well as its
empirical labor slope, in its dimension of domestic underproduction as
well as domestic surplus. The subintensive output of some houses is not
independent of the surplus labor of others. True that (as far as our
information goes) household economic failures seem attributable to
circumstances external to the organization of production: illness,
death, European influence. Yet it would be misleading to contemplate
these failures in isolation from the successes, as if certain families
simply proved unable to make it for reasons entirely their own. Some may
not have made it precisely because it was clear in advance they could
depend on others. And even the underproduction due to unforeseen
circumstances is acceptable to society, these vulnerable households
tolerable, by virtue of a surplus intensity elsewhere, which in a sense
had anticipated in its own dynamic a certain social incidence of
domestic tragedy. In an intensity profile such as Figure 3.3, we have to
deal with an interrelated distribution of household economic
variations—that is, with a social system of domestic production.

The Kapauku of western New Guinea have another system, very different in
its pattern, much more pronounced in its strategy of intensification.
But then, Kapauku is another political system, capable of harnessing
domestic economic efforts to the accumulation of exchangeable products,
pigs and sweet potatoes primarily, whose sale and distribution are main
tactics of an open competition for status (Pospisil, 1963).

Sweet potato cultivation is the key sector of production. The Kapauku to
a very large extent, and their pigs to a lesser extent, live by sweet
potato. It accounts for over 90 percent of the agricultural land use and
seven-eighths of the agricultural labor. Yet the domestic differences in
sweet potato production are extraordinary: a tenfold range of variation
in output/household as recorded by Pospisil for the 16 houses of
Botukebo village over an eight-month period (Table 3.4).

Again for Kapauku we know the intensity of labor only by its product.
The intensity column of Table 3.4 is presented as kilograms of sweet
potato produced per worker—probably introducing an error analogous to
the corresponding Mazulu figures, insofar as different workers expend
unequal efforts per unit weight of output. I have taken the liberty,
moreover, of revising the ethnographer’s household consumer counts,
bringing them closer in line with other Melanesian societies by
assessing adult women at 0.80 of the adult male requirement,

Table 3.4 Household variation in sweet potato cultivation: Botukebo
village, Kapauku (New Guinea), 1955 (after Pospisil, 1963)

[]

[Figure 3.3 Botukebo Village, Kapauku: Domestic Variations in Labor
Intensity (1955)]

Figure 3.3 Botukebo Village, Kapauku: Domestic Variations in Labor
Intensity (1955)

rather than the 0.60 Pospisil had computed from a brief dietary study.
(For the other members of the household, children were figured at 0.50
consumers, adolescents at 1.00 and elders of both sexes at 0.80.)
Adolescents were calculated at 0.50 workers, following the
ethnographer’s usage.

Domestic differences in labor intensity compose a very distinctive
pattern. No clear Chayanov trend is evident on inspection of Table 3.4.
But the apparent irregularity polarizes, or, rather, resolves itself
into two regularities once the household variations are plotted in graph
(Figure 3.3). Everything appears as if the Kapauku village were divided
into two populations, each adhering singularly to its own economic
inclination in one case, something of a Chayanov trend, intensity
increasing with the relative number of consumers, yet in the other
“population” just the reverse. And not only are houses of the latter
series industrious in proportion to their working capacity, the group as
a whole stands at a distinctly higher level than the households of the
first series. But then the Kapauku have a big-man system of the Classic
Melanesian type (see below, “The Economic Intensity of the Social
Order”), a political organization that typically polarizes people’s
relations to the productive process: grouping on one side the big-men or
would-be big-men and their followers, whose production they are able to
galvanize, and on the other side those content to praise and live off
the ambition of others.⁷ The idea seems worth a prediction: that this
bifurcate, “fish-tail” distribution of domestic labor intensity will be
found generally in the Melanesian big-man systems.

Although not evident to inspection, a light Chayanov trend does actually
inhere in the scatter of household intensity variations. It has to be
picked up mathematically (again as a linear regression of deviations
from the means). On balance, the slope of domestic labor intensity moves
upward to the right at the rate of 1,007 kilograms of sweet
potato/gardener for each increase (from the mean) of 1.00 in the
consumers/gardener ratio. Considered by their respective standard
deviations, however, this Kapauku inflection is flatter than the Mazulu
empirical slope. (In z-units, b_(y'x') = 0.62 for Mazulu, 0.28 for
Botukebo.) Yet more interesting, the Kapauku real inflection stands in
an entirely different relation to its slope of normal intensity (Figure
3.4).

I have plotted the slope of normal intensity (the true Chayanov cline)
from Pospisil’s brief dietary study covering 20 people over six days.
The average adult male ration was 2.89 kilograms of sweet
potatoes/day—693.60 kilograms, then, for an eight-month period matching
the duration of the production study. An inflection of 694
kilograms/worker for each 1.00 in c/w passes substantially underneath
the empirical intensity slope; indeed, it does not intersect the latter
through the range of real variations in domestic production. The profile
is altogether different from Mazulu, and as different in its indicative
measures.⁸

Nine of the 16 Botukebo households are operating at surplus intensities
(Table 3.5, p.108). These nine houses include 61.50 gardeners, or 59
percent of the total working force. Their average composition is 1.40
consumers/gardener, their mean labor intensity 1,731 kilograms/gardener.
Hence the point of mean surplus labor, S, falls slightly to the right of
the average household composition—by two percent of the c/w ratio. In
fact, six of the nine houses are below average composition, but not
dramatically so. The impulse to surplus labor thus appears more
generally distributed in Kapauku than in Mazulu. At the same time, the
strength of this impulse is definitely superior. As expressed by the Y
coordinate of S, the mean tendency of surplus intensity, at 1,731
kilograms/worker, is 971 kilograms above the normal tendency (segment
SE). In other words, 69 percent of the Kapauku domestic units,
comprising 59 percent of the labor force, are working at an average of
82 percent above normal intensity.

[Figure 3.4 Botukebo, Kapauku: Social Deviation of Labor Intensity from
the Chayanov Slope]

Figure 3.4 Botukebo, Kapauku: Social Deviation of Labor Intensity from
the Chayanov Slope

The collective surplus labor of these Kapauku units accounts for 47,109
kilograms of sweet potato. Botukebo total village output is 133,172
kilograms. Thus, 35.37 percent of the social product is the contribution
of surplus domestic labor. Taken in comparison with Mazulu (7.67
percent), this figure makes us aware of something heretofore left out of
account: the customary household structure is also part of the society’s
intensification strategy. Botukebo’s advantage over Mazulu does not
consist solely in a higher rate or more general distribution of surplus
labor. Botukebo houses have on average more than twice as many workers,
so multiply by that difference their superiority in rate of intensity.

Finally, as the Kapauku intensity profile shows, the effect of surplus
labor is to displace real domestic output upward by a sizable amount
over the normal. At mean household composition, the empirical inflection
of intensity is 309 kilograms/worker (29 percent) higher

than the Chayanov slope (segment M–M' of Figure 3.4). In terms of the
people’s own consumption requirements (pigs excluded), Botukebo village
as a whole has a surplus output.⁹

Table 3.6 summarizes the differences in production intensity between
Mazulu and Botukebo. These differences are the measure of two different
social organizations of domestic production.

But clearly the task of research is not finished by the drawing of an
intensity profile; it is only thus posed. Before us stretches a work of
difficulty and complexity matched only by its promise of an
anthropological economics, and consisting not merely in the accumulation
of production profiles, but of their interpretation in social terms. For
Mazulu and Botukebo this interpretation would dwell on political
differences—on the contrast between the big-man system of the Kapauku
and traditional political institutions described by the ethnographer of
Tonga as “embryonic,” “largely egalitarian” and generally

Table 3.6 Indices of domestic production: Mazulu and Botukebo

disengaged from the domestic economy (Colson, 1960, pp. 161 f ). It
remains to specify such relations between political form and economic
intensification; and also, the less dramatic economic impact of the
kinship system, almost imperceptible for its prosaic, everyday character
but perhaps not less powerful in the determination of everyday
production.


Kinship and Economic Intensity

The kinship relations prevailing between households must affect their
economic behavior. Descent groups and marital alliances of different
structure, even interpersonal kin networks of different pattern, should
differentially encourage surplus domestic labor. And with varying
success, too, kinship relations counter the centrifugal movement of the
DMP, to determine a more or less intensive exploitation of local
resources. Here then is an idea in some ways banal, in others
outrageous, but nevertheless indicative of the kind of problem worth
further research: all else being equal, Hawaiian kinship is a more
intensive economic system than Eskimo kinship. Because, simply, the
Hawaiian system has a greater degree of classification in the Morganian
sense: a more extensive identification of collateral with lineal
relatives.

Where Eskimo kinship categorically isolates the immediate family,
placing others in a social space definitely outside, Hawaiian extends
familial relations indefinitely along collateral lines. The Hawaiian
household economy risks an analogous integration in the community of
households. Everything depends on the strength and spread of solidarity
in the kinship system. Hawaiian kinship is in these respects superior to
Eskimo. Specifying in this way a wider cooperation, the Hawaiian system
should develop more social pressure on households of greater labor
resources, especially those of the highest c/w ratios. All other things
equal, then, Hawaiian kinship will generate a greater surplus tendency
than Eskimo. It will be able also to sustain a higher norm of domestic
welfare for the community as a whole. Finally, the same argument implies
a greater variation in domestic per capita output for Hawaiian, and a
smaller overall variation in intensity per worker.

Besides, the Hawaiian system probably exploits a given territory at a
higher level, closer to the technical capacity. For kinship is opposed
to the underproduction of the DMP in another way, not just to the
centripetal domestic concern for livelihood but to the centrifugal
tendency of household dispersion, hence not only to the domestic
underuse of labor but to the collective underuse of territory. Against
the constituted dispersion of the DMP the system of kinship erects a
peace of greater or less effect; so, a corresponding concentration of
households and exploitation of resources. The Fijians, who as we have
seen conceive a nonrelative as a stranger, hence as a potential enemy
and victim, understand by their term “to be acquainted” (veikilai) also
the meaning “to be related” (veiweikani); and they have no more common
word for “peace” than “to live as kinsmen” (tiko vakaveiweikani). Here
is one of several primitive versions of that contract lacking in the
DMP, a modus vivendi where the means of force and production remain
segmentary and unalienated. But again different kinship systems, varying
in their powers of attraction, must permit varying degrees of spatial
concentration. They overcome the fragmentation of domestic production in
different measure, and to that extent determine capacities of
territorial occupation and exploitation.

Still, the kinship solidarities of primitive societies cannot be
undifferentiated, given the inherent cleavages of the domestic mode of
production. Even Hawaiian kinship is only formally a universal
familiarity; in practice it continually knows invidious distinctions of
social distance. The household is never entirely submerged in the larger
community, nor are domestic ties ever free from conflict with wider kin
relationships. This is a permanent contradiction of primitive society
and economy. But it is not an apparent contradiction. Normally it is
obscured, repressed by sentiments of sociability that extend to the far
reaches of kinship, mystified by an uncritical ideology of reciprocity,
above all dissimulated by a continuity of social principles from the
family to the larger community, a harmony of organization that makes the
lineage seem the household writ large and the chief father to his
people. The discovery of the contradiction in the normal course of
primitive society therefore takes an act of ethnographic will. Only
occasionally comes a crisis, a crise révélatrice, to lay bare the
structural opposition beyond any possibility of mistaking it. In the
absence of that rare chance—or of close observation of the nuances of
“reciprocity” (see Chapter 5)—one has recourse at first to certain
ethnographic curiosities, proverbs for example, whose elliptical sagesse
may put a construction of paradoxes on what seems otherwise a broad
sociability.

Thus the same Bemba who define a relative as someone to whom you give
food also define a witch as someone “who comes and sits in your house
and says, ‘I expect you are going to cook soon. What a fine lot of meat
you have today,’ or ‘I expect the beer will be ready this afternoon,’ or
some such remark” (Richards, 1939, p. 202). Richards reports the artful
dodges often employed by Bemba housewives to avoid obligations to share:
the concealment of beer upon the appearance of an elderly visiting
relative, then met with an, “Alas, Sir, we poor wretches. We have
nothing to eat” (ibid.).¹⁰

For the Maori, the conflict between the household and larger interests
was current byword: a “squarely-faced opposition,” Firth wrote in an
early article on the Maori proverbs, a “direct contradiction between
sayings which inculcate hospitality and the reverse, liberality and its
opposite” (1926, p. 252). On one hand, hospitality “was one of the
highest virtues of the native . . . inculcated into all and gained the
greatest approval. On the practice of it depended to a large extent
reputation and prestige” (p. 247). But Firth was also quick to note a
whole set of popular dicta to the contrary. Here were proverbs that
privileged an enlightened self-interest over concern for others, the
retention of food over its distribution. “Raw food is still possessed,”
went the adage, “cooked it goes to another”—advising that food be eaten
underdone on pain of being obliged to share it out. Or again, “Broil
your rat [a favorite Maori dish] with its fur on, lest you be disturbed
by someone.” One proverb recognizes in the noble act of sharing a large
residue of discontent:

Haere ana a Manawa yeka
Noho ana a Manawa kuwa

Glad heart went away,
Bitter mind remained.

Another says this of the irksome cadging of relatives:

He huanga ki Matiti
He tama ki Tokerau

A relative in winter,
A son in autumn.

—the man who during the winter planting season is only a distant
relative suddenly becomes a son at the autumn harvest.

These contradictions of the Maori proverbial wisdom translate a real
conflict of society—“two diametrically opposed principals of conduct
working side by side. . . .” Firth, however, did not pause to analyze
them as such in their capacity as social facts. He adopted instead that
kind of “naive anthropology”¹¹ conventional to Economic Science: it was
at base an opposition between human nature and culture, between the
“impulse of the individual to seek his own advantage” and “the expressed
morality of the social group.” Perhaps Lèvi-Strauss would say the model
is after all the Maori’s own, for proverb does hold that raw is to
cooked as possession is to sharing—that is, nature is to culture as the
refusal to share is to reciprocity. In any event, Firth’s later detailed
analysis of Maori economy (1959a) makes it clear why the opposition of
principle was drawn specifically along the line distant relative/son. It
was a conflict between extended kinship and the homebred self-interest
of the whanau, the household, “the basic unit of the Maori economy”:

The whanau held group-ownership of certain types of property, and also
as a body exercised rights to land and its products. Tasks requiring a
small body of workers and co-operation of a not very complex order were
performed by the whanau, and the apportionment of food was largely
managed on this basis. Each family group was a cohesive, self-contained
unit, managing its own affairs, both social and economic, except as
these affected village or tribal policy. Members of a whanau, on the
whole, ate, and dwelt together in a distinct group.

(Firth, 1959a, p. 139)¹²

The position of the household in these primitive societies is one of
constant dilemma and continuous maneuver, temporizing always between
domestic welfare and broader obligations toward kinsmen in the hope of
satisfying the latter without menacing the former. Apart from the
paradoxes of the proverbial wisdom, this tug of war does receive one
general expression: in the nuances of traditional “reciprocity.” For
despite the connotation of equivalence, ordinary reciprocal exchanges
are often unbalanced; that is, on the strictly material plane.
Repayments are only more or less equal to the initial gifts, and they
are only more or less direct in time. The variation is correlated
notably with kinship distance. Balance is the material relation of
distant kinship; closer to home, exchange becomes more disinterested;
there is tolerance of delays or even of complete failure to reciprocate.
To observe that kinship plays out in social force as it moves out in
social distance is not a sufficient explanation or even a very logical
one considering the wide extension of familial categories. More
pertinent is the segmentary separation of economic interests. What gives
this dissipation of kinship solidarity function and definition, makes
meaningful such distinctions as “distant relative”/“son,” is the
economic determination of home as the place where charity begins. The
first premise of “kinship distance” is the DMP. Thus, all the discussion
of Chapter 5 on the tactical play of reciprocity can be taken as a case
in present point.

Despite the constituted contradiction between the household and the
larger kindred, instances of structural breakdown that reveal the
conflict are few in the primitive societies. All the more valuable,
then, Firth’s succeeding work on Tikopia, especially the restudy (with
Spillius) of 1953–54, when he chanced upon this people celebrated for
their hospitality during a trial of famine (Firth, 1959b). Nature had
dealt Tikopia a double blow: hurricanes struck in January 1952 and March
1953, doing great damage to houses, trees and standing crops. Food
shortages followed, in severity varying from district to district and
time to time; generally, the worst occurred between September and
November 1953, a period the ethnographers describe as “famine.” Still,
the people on the whole survived, as did the social system. Yet the
first was not entirely due to the second. Kinship beyond the household
held on in the formal code, but the code was being systematically
honored in the breach, so that even as Tikopian society managed a kind
of moral continuity it showed itself founded on a basic discontinuity.
It was a revelatory crisis. Firth and Spillius speak of “atomization,”
of the fragmentation of larger kin groups and “closer integration” of
the household. “What the famine did,” Firth wrote, “was to reveal the
solidarity of the elementary family” (1959b, p. 84; emphasis mine).

Economic decomposition set in on several fronts, in property and
distribution most notably. Even in planning for recovery after the first
hurricane, it was (apart from the chiefs) every household for itself:
“the use of resources was nearly in every case intended to safeguard
family interests. . . . The range of calculation rarely went beyond
this” (p. 64). Attempts were made to abrogate traditional kinship
privileges of access to family garden areas (p. 70). Land held in common
by close kinsmen became a cause of proprietary contention, sometimes
pitting brother against brother, sometimes resulting in a definitive
division and precise bounding of fraternal claims (Firth, 1959b;
Spillius, 1957, p. 13).

The movement in the sphere of food distribution was more complicated.
Exchange showed a predictable pulsation between an expansion of
sociability and generosity under trial, and a reversion to domestic
isolation as the trial turned into disaster.¹³ At those times and in the
places food shortage was less severe, the household economy would even
efface itself: closely related families suspended their separate
existences to pool supplies in a collective oven. But as the crisis
deepened, an opposed tendency set in, made up of two complementary
trends: decrease in sharing and increase of theft.¹⁴ Firth estimated
that theft reached a level fivefold higher than its incidence during his
first visit twenty-five years earlier, and where formerly it was
restricted mainly to “semi-luxuries” now it was largely theft of
staples—nor were ritual crops immune, or members of chiefly houses
guiltless. “Nearly everyone was stealing and nearly everyone was robbed”
(Spillius, 1957, p. 12). Meanwhile, after the initial wave of
sociability, the frequency and social range of sharing progressively
declined. Instead of food, visitors got only apologies, perhaps
disingenuous. Supplies were hidden from kinsmen, even locked up in boxes
and someone left in the house to guard them. Firth describes such
un-Tikopian behavior as this:

In some cases the kinsman would suspect there was food in his host’s
house; he would sit and chat and wait, hoping that the host would give
way and use it. But nearly always the host would hold out until the
guest had gone before unlocking the box and taking out the food.

(Firth, 1959b, p. 83)

Not that there was a war of every family against every family. The
Tikopians remained polite. As Firth wrote, manners continued if morals
degenerated. But the crisis did test certain structural tolerances. It
exposed the weakness of that celebrated “We, the Tikopia” by the
strength of the private household. The household proved a fortress of
self-interest which in the crisis cut itself apart, raised its social
drawbridges—when it was not engaged in sallies against the gardens of
kith and kin.

The DMP has to be counteracted and transcended. This not simply for
technical reasons of cooperation, but because the domestic economy is as
unreliable as it is apparently functional, a private nuisance and a
public menace. The greater kinship system is one important way it is
counteracted. But the continuing hold of the domestic economy then
leaves its mark on the whole society: a contradiction between the
infrastructure and the superstructure of kinship that is never entirely
suppressed but continues in subtle ways to influence the everyday
disposition of goods, and under stress may surface to put the whole
economy in a state of segmentary collapse.


The Economic Intensity of the Political Order

Two words are used for feasts [among the Sa’a], ngäuhe and houlaa: the
meaning of the first is “eating,” of the second “fame.”

(Ivens, 1927, p. 60)

“Without feasts” [a Wogeo man] said, “we would not collect all our
chestnuts nor plant so many trees. We would perhaps have enough to eat,
but we would never have any really big meals.”

(Hogbin, 1938–39, p. 324)

In the course of primitive social evolution, main control over the
domestic economy seems to pass from the formal solidarity of the kinship
structure to its political aspect. As the structure is politicized,
especially as it is centralized in ruling chiefs, the household economy
is mobilized in a larger social cause. This impulse transmitted by
polity to production is often attested ethnographically. For although
the primitive headman or chief may be himself driven by personal
ambition, he incarnates the collective finalities; he personifies a
public economic principle in opposition to the private ends and petty
self-concerns of the household economy. Tribal powers that be and
would-be powers encroach upon the domestic system to undermine its
autonomy, curb its anarchy, and unleash its productivity. “The pace of
life in a given Manus village” Margaret Mead observed, “the amount of
goods in circulation, and therefore the actual amount of goods in
existence depend on the number of leaders in that village. It varies
with their enterprise, intelligence, and aggressiveness, and the number
of their kin whose cooperation they can enlist” (1937a, pp. 216–217).

Conversely, but to the same rule, Mary Douglas introduces her major
monograph on the Lele of Kasai as a study in the failure of authority.
And she notes immediately the economic consequence: “Those who have had
anything to do with the Lele must have noticed the absence of anyone who
could give orders with a reasonable hope of being obeyed. . . . The lack
of authority goes a long way to explain their poverty” (1963, p. 1).
This negative effect we have seen before, especially in relation to
underuse of subsistence resources. As Cam-eiro perceived it for the
Kuikuru, and Izikowitz advances a similar appreciation of Lamet, the
issue is between a chronic tendency to divide and disperse the
community, and, on the other side, the development of political controls
which would check this fission and effect an economic dynamic more
appropriate to the society’s technical capacity.

I discuss this aspect of the primitive political economy only briefly
and schematically.

Everything depends on the political negation of the centrifugal tendency
to which the DMP is naturally inclined. Otherwise said (and other
factors being equal), the approximation to productive capacity
accomplished by any given society is a vector of two contending
political principles: on one hand, the centrifugal dispersion inscribed
in the DMP—already a kind of reflexive mechanism of peace; on the other
hand, the accord that can be installed by prevailing institutions of
hierarchy and alliance, whose success is measurable rather by the
concentration of population. Of course, more than just the tribal
authorities are at issue, and more than their intervention against the
primitive reflex of fission. The regional intensity of occupation
depends too on relations between communities, relations possibly carried
on as much by marriages and lineages as by constituted authorities. My
concern here is merely to indicate the problématique: each political
organization harbors a coefficient of population density, thus in
conjunction with the ecological givens, a determinate intensity of land
use.

The second aspect of the general problem, the effect of polity upon
household labor, I discuss in greater detail. This in part because more
ethnographic detail is available. It is even possible to isolate certain
formal qualities of leadership structure that imply different degrees of
domestic productivity, so hold out the hope of analysis in terms of a
social intensity profile. Before these flights of typology, however, we
should first consider the structural and ideological means by which
power in the primitive societies is realized in production.

The impact of the political system upon domestic production is not
unlike the impact of the kinship system. But then, the organization of
authority is not differentiated from the kinship order, and its economic
effect is best understood as a radicalization of the kinship function.
Even many of the greatest African chiefs, and all those of Polynesia,
were not disengaged from the kinship nexus, and it is this which renders
comprehensible the economics of their political acts— as well as the
politics of their economics. Thus I specifically exclude from this
discussion true kings and states, to speak only of societies where
kinship is king and the “king” only a superior kinsman. At the most we
have to deal with “chiefs” properly so-called, and chieftainship is a
political differentiation of a kinship order—as kingship is usually a
kinship differentiation of a political order (State). Moreover, what is
true of the most advanced form, chieftainship, is à plus forte raison
true of all other kinds of tribal leaders: they hold positions in and of
a network of kinship. And as it is structurally, so ideologically and in
practice the economic role of the headman is only a differentiation of
kinship morality. Leadership is here a higher form of kinship, hence a
higher form of reciprocity and liberality. This repeats itself in
ethnographic descriptions from all over the primitive world, even to the
dilemmas posed by chiefly obligations of generosity:

The [Nambikwara] chief must not merely do well: he must try, and his
group will expect him to try, to do better than the others. How does the
chief fulfill these obligations? The first and main instrument of his
power is his generosity. Generosity is among most primitive peoples, and
above all in America, an essential attribute of power. It has a role to
play even in those rudimentary cultures where the notion of property
consists merely in a handful of rudely fashioned objects. Although the
chief does not seem to be in a privileged position, from the material
point of view, he must have under his control surplus quantities of
food, tools, weapons, and ornaments which, however trifling in
themselves, are nonetheless considerable in relation to the prevailing
poverty. When an individual, a family, or the band as a whole, wishes or
needs something, it is to the chief that an appeal must be made.
Generosity is, therefore, the first attribute to be expected of a new
chief. It is a note which will be struck almost continuously; and from
the nature, discordant or otherwise, of the sound which results the
chief can judge of his standing with the band. His “subjects” make the
most of all this.. . . The chiefs were my best informers; and as I knew
the difficulties of their position I liked to reward them liberally.
Rarely, however, did any of my presents remain in their hands for more
than a day or two. And when I moved on, after sharing for several weeks
the life of any particular band, its members rejoiced in the acquisition
of axes, knives, pearls, and so forth from my stores. The chief, by
contrast, was generally as poor, in material terms, as he had been when
I arrived. His share, which was very much larger than the average
allowance, had all been extorted from him.

(Lévi-Strauss, 1961, p. 304)

The same refrain appears in the complaint of the Tahitian priest-chief,
Ha’amanimani, to the Duff missionaries:

“You give me,” says he, “much parow [talk] and much prayers to the
Eatora [God], but very few axes, knives, scissars, or cloth.” The case
is, that whatever he receives he immediately distributes among his
friends and dependents; so that for all the numerous presents he had
received, he had nothing now to shew, except a glazed hat, a pair of
breeches, and an old black coat, which he had fringed with red feathers.
And this prodigal behaviour he excuses by saying that, were he not to do
so, he should never be a king (sic), nor even remain a chief of any
consequence.

(Duff Missionaries, 1799, pp. 224–225)

This benevolent interest of the headman in the process of distribution,
and the political energy he accumulates therefrom, are generated by the
field of kinship in which he moves. In one respect it is a matter of
prestige. Insofar as the society is socially committed to kin
relationships, morally it is commited to generosity; whoever, therefore,
is liberal automatically merits the general esteem. Generous, the chief
is a paragon among kinsmen. But more profoundly, his generosity is a
kind of constraint. “Gifts make slaves,” the Eskimo say, “as whips make
dogs.” Common in any society, this constraint gains in force where the
norms of kinship are dominant. Because kinship is a social relation of
reciprocity, of mutual aid; hence, generosity is a manifest imposition
of debt, putting the recipient in a circumspect and responsive relation
to the donor during all that period the gift is unrequited. The economic
relation of giver-receiver is the political relation of
leader-follower.¹⁵ This is the working principle. More exactly, it is
the operative ideology.

“Ideology” that is revealed as such from the beginning by its
contradiction with the larger ideal in which it is fixed, that is, with
reciprocity. Always the rank relation, faithful to the qualities of a
society it would not abolish, is compensatory. It is conceived in terms
of balance, a “mutual helpfulness,” a “continual reciprocity.”¹⁶ But in
strictly material terms the relation cannot be both “reciprocal” and
“gener-ous,” the exchange at once equivalent and more so. “Ideology,”
then, because “chiefly liberality” must ignore the contrary flow of
goods from people to chief—perhaps by categorizing this as the chief’s
due—on pain of canceling out the generosity; or else, or in addition,
the relation conceals a material unbalance—perhaps rationalized by other
kinds of compensation—on pain of negating the reciprocity. We shall find
that material unbalances in fact exist; depending on the system, they
are borne by one or the other side, headman or people. Yet the
conjunction of a norm of reciprocity with a reality of exploitation
would not distinguish the primitive political economy from any other:
everywhere in the world the indigenous category for exploitation is
“reciprocity.”¹⁷

Considered at a more abstract level, the ideological ambiguity of the
chiefly office, at once generous and reciprocal, expresses perfectly the
contradiction of a primitive nobility: between power and kinship,
inequality in a society of amicability. The only reconciliation, of
course, is an inequality that is generally beneficial, the only
justification of power its disinterestedness; which is to say,
economically, a distribution of goods from the chiefs to the people that
deepens at the same time it offsets the latter’s dependence—and leaves
no interpretation of the distribution from people to chiefs but as a
moment in a cycle of reciprocity. The ideological ambiguity is
functional. On the one hand, the ethic of chiefly generosity blesses the
inequality; on the other, the ideal of reciprocity denies that it makes
any difference.¹⁸

However it is realized, one thing the ideology of headmanship does not
admit: the economic introversion of the DMP. The “liberality” of the
chief must stimulate production beyond the usual aims of domestic
livelihood, if only in the chief’s own household; reciprocity between
the ranks will do the same on a more or less general scale. The
political economy cannot survive on that restrained use of resources
which for the domestic economy is a satisfactory existence.

We return thus to the original point: the political life is a stimulus
to production. But it is so to varying degrees. The following paragraphs
trace some of the variations in political form that seem to connote
differing domestic productivities, beginning with the Melanesian bigman
orders.

Open systems of status competition, such as prevail in Melanesia,
develop economic impact in the first place from the ambition of aspiring
big-men. Intensification appears in their own work and the labors of
their own household. The New Guinea Busama clubhouse leader, as Hogbin
reports,

has to work harder than anyone else to keep up his stocks of food. The
aspirant for honours cannot rest on his laurels but must go on holding
large feasts and piling up credits. It is acknowledged that he has to
toil early and late—“His hands are never free from earth, and his
forehead continually drips with sweat.”

(Hogbin, 1951, p. 131)¹⁹

To this end of accumulation and generosity, the Melanesian leader
typically attempts to enlarge his domestic working force, perhaps by
polygyny: “Another woman go garden, another woman go take firewood,
another woman go catch fish, another woman cook him—husband he sing out
plenty people come kaikai [eat]” (Landtman, 1927, p. 168). Clearly the
Chayanov slope begins to suffer a political deviation; against the rule,
certain of the most effective groups are working the most. But the
big-man would quickly surpass the narrow base of autoexploitation.
Deploying his resources carefully, the emerging leader uses wealth to
place others in his debt. Moving beyond his household, he constructs a
following whose production may be harnassed to his ambition. The process
of intensification in production is thus coupled to reciprocity in
exchange. So the Lakalai big-man, with a view toward sponsoring memorial
festivals and participating successfully in external trade,

must not only show personal industry but also be able to call on the
industry of others. He must have a following. If he is blessed with many
junior kinsmen whose labor he actually commands, he is under less
pressure to build up a following. If he is not so blessed, he must
acquire his following by assuming responsibility for the welfare of
remoter kinsmen. By displaying all of the necessary attributes of a
responsible leader, by dutifully sponsoring festivals on behalf of his
children, by being ready with wealth to meet his obligations to his
in-laws, by buying magic and dances for his children, by assuming
whatever burdens he can feasibly carry, he makes himself attractive to
older and younger kinsmen alike. . .. His younger kinsmen court his
support by volunteering to help him in his undertakings, by cheerfully
obeying his calls to work, and by catering to his wishes. They tend
increasingly to entrust their wealth to him as trustee in preference to
some senior relative.

(Chowning and Goodenough, 1965–66, p. 457)

Drawing then from a local group of followers economically engaged to his
cause, the big-man opens the final and socially most expansive phase of
his ambition. He sponsors or contributes heavily to great public feasts
and distributions that reach outside his own circle to establish his
dignity, “build his name” Melanesians say, in society at large. For

the purpose in owning pigs and pig-wealth is not to store them nor to
put them on recurrent display: it is to use them. The aggregate effect
is a vast circulating flow of pigs, plumes and shells. The motive force
of the flow is the reputation men can gain from ostentatious
participation in it.. . . The Kuma “big men” or “men of strength” . ..
who command much wealth, are entrepreneurs in the sense they control the
flow of valuables between clans by making fresh presentations on their
own account and choosing whether or not to contribute to others. Their
profit in these transactions is incremental reputation.. . . The aim is
not simply to be wealthy, nor even to act as only the wealthy can act:
it is to be known to be wealthy.

(Reay, 1959, p. 96)

The big-man’s personal career has a general political significance. The
big-man and his consuming ambition are means whereby a segmentary
society, “acephalous” and fragmented into small autonomous communities,
overcomes these cleavages, at least provisionally, to fashion larger
fields of relation and higher levels of cooperation. Through concern for
his own reputation, the Melanesian big-man becomes a point of
articulation in a tribal structure.

It should not be supposed that the big-man of Melanesian type is a
necessary condition of the segmentary societies. Chiefs of the Northwest
Coast Indian villages achieve the same sort of articulation, and if in
their potlatches it is by external feasting similar to the prestige
quest of many Melanesian leaders, the chief has an entirely different
relation to the internal economy. A Northwest Coast chieftain is a
lineage head, and in this capacity is necessarily accorded a certain
right to group resources. He is not obliged to establish a personal
claim by the dynamic of an autoexploitation put at the others’ disposal.
Of even greater contrast, a segmentary society may dispense with all but
minimal ties between its constituent parts; or else, as in the
celebrated case of the Nuer segmentary lineage system, the relations
between local groups are fixed mainly and automatically by descent,
without recourse to a differentiation among men.

The Nuer pose an alternative to the segmentary politics of personal
power and renown: the anonymous and silent government of structure. In
classic segmentary lineage systems, headmen have to be content with a
local importance at best, and perhaps proven by attributes other than
their generosity. The interesting deduction is that the segmentary
lineage system has a lower coefficient of intensity than the Melanesian
polity.

The Melanesian system can be put to another speculative purpose. Beyond
the contrast it suggests between tribes with and without rulers, in its
successive phases of generous autoexploitation and an accumulation
funded by reciprocity, the career of the Melanesian bigman makes a
transition between two forms of economic authority that elsewhere appear
separately and appear to have an unequal economic potential.
Autoexploitation is a kind of original and underdeveloped economics of
respect. It is often encountered in the autonomous local groups of
tribal societies—the Nambikwara “chief” is an example of the genre—and
most commonly in the camps of hunters and gatherers:

No Bushman wants prominence, but Toma went further than most in avoiding
prominence; he had almost no possessions and gave away everything that
came into his hands. He was diplomatic, for in exchange for his
self-imposed impoverty he won the respect and following of all the
people there.

(Thomas, 1959, p. 183)

Authority of this kind has obvious limitations, both economic and
political—and the modesty of each sets limits to the other. Only the
domestic labor immediately under the control of the headman is
politically engaged. While his own household labor pool is expandable to
a degree, as by polygyny, neither through structure nor gratitude does
the headman gain significant command over the output of other domestic
groups. The surplus of one house put to the benefit of others, this
politique is closest to the ideal of noble liberality—and the weakest
economics of leadership. Its principal force is attraction rather than
compulsion, and the field of this force is principally restricted to
people in direct personal contact with the leader. For under the simple
and often capricious technical circumstances, with the labor of so few
provisioning it, the headman’s “fund of power” (as Malinowski called it)
is meagre and rapidly exhausted. Furthermore, it is necessarily diluted
in political efficacy, the influence to be had by its distribution, as
this distribution is stretched out in social space. The greatest
dividends of influence, then, are accrued in the local cohort, and in
the form of the respect due a self-effacing generosity. But no one is
thereby rendered dependent, and this respect will have to compete with
all the other kinds of deference that can be accorded in face-to-face
relations. Hence the economic is not necessarily the dominant basis of
authority in the simpler societies: by comparison with generational
status, or with personal attributes and capacities from the mystical to
the oratorical, it may be politically negligible.

At the other extreme is chieftainship properly so-called, as it
developed, for example, in high islands of Polynesia, among nomads of
interior Asia, and many central and southern African peoples. The
contrast of economic and political form seems complete: from
autoexploitation—by the sweat of the leader’s brow—to tribute,
accompanied sometimes by the idea that even to shoulder a burden is
beneath the chiefly dignity: for that matter, dignity may require that
he be carried; from a respect personally accorded to a command
structurally bestowed; and from a liberality something less than
reciprocal to a reciprocity less than liberal. The difference is
institutional. It lies in the formation of hierarchical relations within
and between local groups, a regional political frame maintained by a
system of chiefs, major and minor, holding sway over segments of greater
and lesser order and subordinate all to the one paramount. The
integration of parochial groups tenuously broached by Melanesian
big-men, if unimaginable to prestigious hunters, is achieved in these
pyramidal societies. They are still primitive. The political armature is
provided by kinship groups. But these groups make positions of official
authority a condition of their organization. Now men do not personally
construct their power over others; they come to power. Power resides in
the office, in an organized acquiesence to chiefly privileges and
organized means of upholding them. Included is a specific control over
the goods and the services of the underlying population. The people owe
in advance their labor and their products. And with these funds of
power, the chief indulges in grandiose gestures of generosity ranging
from personal aid to massive support of collective ceremonial or
economic enterprise. The flow of goods between chiefs and people then
becomes cyclical and continual:

The prestige of a [Maori] chief was bound up with his free use of
wealth, particularly food. This in turn tended to secure for him a
larger revenue from which to display his hospitality, since his
followers and relatives brought him choice gifts.. . . Apart from lavish
entertainment of strangers and visitors, the chief also disbursed wealth
freely as presents among his followers. By this means their allegiance
was secured and he repaid them for the gifts and personal services
rendered to him.. . . There was thus a continual reciprocity between
chief and people.. . . It was by his accumulation and possession of
wealth, and his subsequent lavish distribution of it, that such a man
was able to give the spur to . .. important tribal enterprises. He was a
kind of channel through which wealth flowed, concentrating it only to
pour it out freely again.

(Firth, 1959a, p. 133)

In advanced forms of chieftainship, of which the Maori is not
particularly an illustration, this redistribution is not without
material benefit to the chief. If an historical metaphor be permitted:
what begins with the would-be headman putting his production to others’
benefit, ends, to some degree, with others putting their production to
the chief’s benefit.

Eventually the ideals of reciprocity and chiefly liberality serve as
mystification of the people’s dependence. Liberal, the chief only
returns to the community what he has received from the community.
Reciprocal then? Perhaps he did not return all of that. The cycle has
all the reciprocity of the Christmas present the small child gives his
father, bought with the money his father had given him. Still this
familial exchange is effective socially, and so is chiefly
redistribution. Besides, when the timing and diversity of the goods
redistributed are taken into consideration, the people may appreciate
concrete benefits otherwise unobtainable. In any case, the material
residue that sometimes falls to the chief is not the main sense of the
institution. The sense is the power residing with the chief from the
wealth he has let fall to the people. And in a larger vantage, by thus
supporting communal welfare and organizing communal activities, the
chief creates a collective good beyond the conception and capacity of
the society’s domestic groups taken separately. He institutes a public
economy greater than the sum of its household parts.

This collective good is also won at the expense of the household parts.
Too frequently and mechanically anthropologists attribute the appearance
of chieftainship to the production of surplus (for example, Sahlins,
1958). In the historic process, however, the relation has been at least
mutual, and in the functioning of primitive society it is rather the
other way around. Leadership continually generates domestic surplus. The
development of rank and chieftainship becomes, pari passu, development
of the productive forces.

In brief testimony, the remarkable ability of certain political orders
distinguished by advanced ideas of chieftainship to augment and
diversify production. Again I use Polynesian examples, partly for the
reason that in earlier work I had argued the exceptional productivity of
this polity by comparison with the Melanesian (Sahlins, 1963); partly
also because a few of the Polynesian societies, Hawaii particularly,
take the primitive contradiction between the domestic and public
economies to an ultimate crisis—revelatory it seems not only of this
disconformity but of the economic and political limits of kinship
society.

Comparison with Melanesia would not only compliment the Polynesian
achievement in overall production, but for the occupation and
improvement of once-marginal areas effected under the aegis of ruling
chiefs. To this process the chronic struggles between neighboring
chiefdoms often supplied decisive force. Competition probably accounts
for a remarkable tendency to invert by culture the ecology of nature:
many of the poorer regions of Polynesian high islands were the more
intensively exploited. The contrast in this respect between the
southeast peninsula of Tahiti and the fertile northwest moved one of
Captain Cook’s officers, Anderson, to reflect positively Toynbeean: “It
shows,” he said, “that even the defects of nature . . . have their use
in promoting man to industry and art” (cited in Lewthwaite, 1964, p.
33). The Tahitian group is even better known for the integration of
offshore atolls in mainland chiefdoms. Here was a political combination
of economies so different as to constitute in Melanesia, and even other
parts of Polynesia, the basis of entirely different cultural systems.
Tetiaroa is the most celebrated example: “the Palm Beach of the South
Seas,” a complex of thirteen “spit-of-land” coral islets 26 miles north
of Tahiti, occupied for marine and coconut production by men of the Pau
district chief and as a watering place of the Tahitian nobility. By
forbidding all cultivation except coconut and taro on Tetiaroa, the Pau
chief forced a continuous exchange with Tahiti. In a punitive action
against the chief, Cook once seized 25 canoes en route from Tetiaroa
with a cargo of cured fish. “Even in stormy weather, the missionaries
[of the Duff] counted 100 canoes on the beach [of Tetiaroa], for there
the aristocracy went to feast and fatten, and their flotillas returned
‘rich as a fleet of galleons’ ” (Lewthwaite, 1966, p. 49).

Then again, one might consider the impressive development of taro
cultivation in the Hawaiian Islands, notable for its extent, diversity
and intensity: the 250–350 different varieties, often recognized for
suitability in different microenvironments; the large irrigation
networks (as in the Waipio Valley, island of Hawaii, site of a single
complex three miles by three-fourths to one mile); irrigation remarkable
for the complexity of ditching and protective works (a canal in Waimea,
Kauai runs 400 feet around a cliff and up to 20 feet above level, while
in the Kalalau Valley a sloping sea wall built of great boulders
shelters a broad stretch of shoreward flats); irrigation remarkable
again for the utilization of tiny pockets of soil interspersed through
rocky lava, and for the terracing of narrow gorges deep into the
mountains, “where the least available space has been won.” Nor is this
to catalogue the manifold ecological specialization of agricultural
techniques, the several types of forest as well as wet taro cultivation,
and in the swamps a form of chinampa, the “muddyback method.”²⁰

The relationship between Polynesian chieftainship and the
intensification of production can be given historic depth. In Hawaii, at
least, the political transformation of marginal areas knows legendary
depth: a chief who used his authority to squeeze water out of rocks. On
the western side of the Keanae valley, Maui, is a peninsula that stands
a mile out to sea and a much longer distance beyond ecological reason:
fundamentally barren and rocky, without natural soil, but covered
nevertheless with famous acres of taro. Tradition lays the miracle to an
old chief, his name now forgotten,

. .. who was constantly at war with the people of Wailua and determined
that he must have more good land under cultivation, more food, and more
people. So he set all his people to work (they were then living within
the valley and going down to the peninsula only for fishing), carrying
soil in baskets from the valley down to the lava point. The soil and the
banks enclosing the patches were thus, in the course of many years, all
transplanted and packed into place. Thus did the watered flats of Keanae
originate.

(Handy, 1940, p. 110)

Perhaps the Hawaiian tradition is not truly historical. Still it is the
true history of Polynesia: a kind of paradigm of which the entire
archaeological sequence of the Marquesas as presented by Suggs, for
example, is only another version. All Marquesan prehistory recounts the
same dialogue between intervalley competition, the exercise of chiefly
power, and the occupation and development of marginal areas of the
islands (Suggs, 1961).

Is there evidence in Hawaii or Tahiti of political crises comparable to
the episode Firth and Spillius described for Tikopia? Do we discover,
that is to say, analogous crises révélatrices, here exposing the
vertical contradiction between the household economy and the
chieftainship, as the Tikopian exposed the horizontal contradiction
between household and kindred? But then, the Tikopian famine is not
irrelevant either to the first question, for the same hurricanes of 1953
and 1954 that shook the kinship structure also almost brought down the
chiefs. As the supply of food diminished, economic relations between
chiefs and people deteriorated. Customary dues to the clan leaders were
neglected; while, to the contrary, stealing from chiefly gardens “became
almost barefaced.” Said Pa Ngarumea: “When the land is firm people pay
respect to the things of the chief, but when there is a famine people go
and make sport of them” (Firth, 1959b, p. 92). Moreover, reciprocity in
goods is only the concrete mode of the Tikopian political dialogue; its
breakdown meant the whole system of political communication was in
question. The Tikopian polity had begun to unhinge. An uncommon rift
appeared between chiefs and the underlying population. Somber traditions
were resurrected— “myths,” Spillius considers them—telling how certain
chiefs of old, when pressure on the local food supply became
unsupportable, drove the commoners en masse off the island. To the
present chiefs the idea seemed fantastic, but one private meeting of
notables unwittingly provoked a mass mobilization of the people of the
Faea district, forewarned by a spirit medium and forearmed to resist a
chiefly conspiracy to expel them (Firth, 1959b, p. 93; Spillius, 1957,
pp. 16–17). Still the antagonism remained incomplete, the commoners in
an undeveloped stage of political consciousness and the chiefs in
command throughout. Battle was not given. Indeed, it was never even
conceived by Tikopians in the classic form of a popular uprising against
the powers that be. On the contrary, it was the chiefs who constituted
the danger to the commoners. And to the last, everyone continued to
concede the chiefs’ traditional privilege of survival, whoever else
might have to die—and however much food was being stolen from them. The
Tikopian political crisis was thus aborted.²¹

Let us then consider Hawaii, where one can follow conflicts of the same
general type to the conclusion of a successful rebellion. Conflicts “of
the same general type” in the sense they brought forth the opposition
between the chieftainship and domestic interests, but the differences
are also important. In Tikopia the political stress was externally
induced. It did not unfold from the normal working of Tikopian society,
which normally does work, but in the wake of a natural catastrophe. And
it could have happened any structural time, at any phase in the
development of the system. The political upset in Tikopia was exogenic,
abnormal and historically indeterminate. But the rebellions with which
Hawaiian traditional history fascinated itself, Hawaiian history had
made. They were produced in the normal course of Hawaiian society, and
more than endogenic, they were recurrent. These troubles, besides, seem
incapable of realization at just any historic stage. They mark rather
the maturity of the Polynesian system, the working through of its
contradictions to the point of denouement. They reveal the structural
limits.

The paramount chiefs of old Hawaii reigned each and independently over a
single island, a section of one of the larger islands, sometimes over
districts of neighboring islands. The variation is already part of the
problem: the tendency, on which traditions discourse at length, for
chiefly domains to enlarge and contract, extended once by conquest only
to be partitioned again by rebellion. And this cycle was geared to a
second, such that the rotation of one would set off the other. Ruling
chiefs showed a propensity to “eat the power of the government too
much”; that is, to oppress the people economically, which the chiefs
found themselves forced to do when the political domain was enlarged,
despite their obligations as kinsmen and chiefs to consider the people’s
welfare, which they nevertheless found difficult to do even when the
polity was reduced.

For the administration of merely an ordinary domain would bite deeply
into the labor and goods of the common people. The population was
dispersed over a wide area; the means of transportation and
communication were rudimentary. The chieftainship besides enjoyed no
monopoly of force. It had to meet its diverse problems of rule
organizationally then, by a certain administrative formation: a bloated
political establishment that sought to cope with a proliferation of
tasks by a multiplication of personnel, at the same time economizing its
scarce real force by an awesome display of conspicuous consumption as
intimidating to the people as it was glorifying to the chiefs. But the
material weight of this chiefly retinue and the sumptuary airs it
affected fell, of course, on the ordinary people. It fell especially on
those nearest the paramount, within a range that made transport
worthwhile and the threat of sanctions effective. Conscious, it seems,
of the logistic burdens they were obliged to impose, the Hawaiian chiefs
conceived several means to relieve the pressure, notably including a
career of conquest with a view toward enlarging the tributary base. In
the successful event, however, with the realm now stretched over distant
and lately subdued hinterlands, the bureaucratic costs of rule
apparently rose higher than the increases in revenue, so that the
victorious chief merely succeeded in adding enemies abroad to a worse
unrest at home. The cycles of centralization and exaction are now at
their zenith.

At this point, Hawaiian traditions will hint of intrigue and conspiracy
mounted against the ruling chief by local followers, perhaps in
collusion with distant subjects.²² The rebellion is launched always by
important chiefs, who of course had their own reasons for challenging
the paramount, but had their power to do so as personifications of a
more general discontent. The revolt takes form as a court assassination,
an armed struggle, or both. And then, as one ethnological bard said, the
Hawaiians sat cross-legged upon the ground and told sad stories of the
death of kings:

Many kings have been put to death by the people because of their
oppression of the makaainana [the commoners]. The following kings lost
their lives on account of their cruel exactions on the commoners:
Koihala was put to death in Kau, for which reason the district of Kau
was called the Wier. Koka-i-ka-lani was an alii [chief] who was
violently put to death in Kau . .. Enu-nui-kai-malino was an alii who
was secretly put out of the way by the fishermen in Keahuolu in Kona .
.. King Hakau was put to death by the hand of Umi at Waipio valley in
Hamakua, Hawaii.²³ Lono-i-ka-makahiki was a king who was banished by the
people of Kona.. . . It was for this reason that some of the ancient
kings had a wholesome fear of the people.

(Malo, 1951, p. 195)

It is important that the death of tyrants was taken in charge by men of
authority and chiefs themselves. The rebellion was not then a
revolution; the chieftainship if overthrown was replaced by a
chieftainship. Delivering itself of oppressive rulers, the system did
not consequently rid itself of basic contradictions, transcend and
transform itself, but continued instead to cycle within the confines of
existing institutions. In the object of replacing a bad (exacting) chief
by a good (generous) one, the rebellion would have a fair chance of
success. In its aftermath, the enlarged political domain would probably
fragment, as recalcitrant outdistricts regained their independence. The
chieftainship thus decentralized, its economic weight was reduced. Power
and oppression returned to the nadir—for the time being.

The epic quality of Hawaiian traditions conceals a more mundane
causality. Manifestly, the political cycle had an economic base. The
great struggles between powerful chiefs and their respective districts
were transposed forms of the more essential struggle over domestic
labor: whether it was to be more modestly employed in household
livelihood or more intensively deployed to political organization. That
the chiefs had the right to levy the domestic economy was not contested.
The problem was, on one hand, the customary limit to this right, as
established by the existing structure, and on the other hand, the
regular abuse of it set off by a structural exigency. Hawaiian
chieftainship had distanced itself from the people, yet it had never
definitively severed the kinship relation. This primitive bond between
ruler and ruled remained in force, and with it the usual ethics of
reciprocity and chiefly generosity.²⁴ Malo says of the great storehouses
maintained by ruling chiefs that they were “means of keeping the people
contented, so they would not desert the king”—this in a passage
otherwise remarkable for its political cynicism: “as the rat will not
desert the pantry . . . where he thinks food is, so the people will not
desert the king while they think there is food in his storehouse” (Malo,
1951, p. 195).

In other words, the chiefly toll on the household economy had a moral
limit consistent with the kinship configuration of the society. Up to a
point it was the chief’s due, but beyond that, highhandedness. The
organization set an acceptable proportion between the allocation of
labor to the chiefly and domestic sectors. It set a fitting proportion
also between retention of the people’s goods by the chief and
redistribution to the people. It could tolerate only a certain unbalance
in these matters. Besides, some propriety ought to be observed. Exaction
by force is no customary gift, nor is pillage the chief’s due. The
chiefs had their own lands, set aside for their support, and received
many gifts regularly from the people. When a ruling chief’s men seized
the people’s pigs and plundered their farms, the “makaainana were not
pleased with this conduct on the part of the king”—it was “tyranny,”
“abuse of authority” (Malo, 1951, p. 196). Chiefs were too much inclined
to work the makaainana: “It was a life of weariness . . . they were
compelled at frequent intervals to go here and there to do this and that
work for the lord of the land” (p. 64). But then let the leader beware:
“The people made war on bad kings in old times.” Thus did the system
define and maintain a ceiling on the intensification of domestic
production by political means and for public purposes.

Malo, Kamakau and the other custodians of Hawaiian tradition refer
habitually to the paramount chiefs as “kings.” But the trouble was
precisely that they were not kings. They had not broken structurally
with the people at large, so they might dishonor the kinship morality
only on pain of a mass disaffection. And without a monopoly of force,
the probability was that the general discontent would come down on their
particular heads. In a comparative perspective, the great disadvantage
of the Hawaiian organization was its primitiveness: it was not a state.
Its further advance could only have been secured by an evolution in that
direction. If Hawaiian society discovered limits to its ability to
augment production and polity, this threshold which it had reached but
could not cross was the boundary of primitive society itself.



4 THE SPIRIT OF THE GIFT


Marcel Mauss’s famous Essay on the Gift becomes his own gift to the
ages. Apparently completely lucid, with no secrets even for the novice,
it remains a source of an unending ponderation for the anthropologist du
métier, compelled as if by the hau of the thing to come back to it again
and again, perhaps to discover some new and unsuspected value, perhaps
to enter into a dialogue which seems to impute some meaning of the
reader’s but in fact only renders the due of the original. This chapter
is an idiosyncratic venture of the latter kind, unjustified moreover by
any special study of the Maori or of the philosophers (Hobbes and
Rousseau especially) invoked along the way. Yet in thinking the
particular thesis of the Maori hau and the general theme of social
contract reiterated throughout the Essay, one appreciates in another
light certain fundamental qualities of primitive economy and polity,
mention of which may forgive the following overextended commentary.


"Explication De Texte"

The master concept of the Essai sur le don is the indigenous Maori idea
hau, introduced by Mauss as “the spirit of things and in particular of
the forest and the game it contains . . .” (1966, p. 158).¹ The Maori
before any other archaic society, and the idea of hau above all similar
notions, responded to the central question of the Essay, the only one
Mauss proposed to examine “à fond”: “ What is the principle of right and
interest which, in societies of primitive or archaic type, requires that
the gift received must be repaid? What force is there in the thing given
which compels the recipient to make a return?” (p. 148). The hau is that
force. Not only is it the spirit of the foyer, but of the donor of the
gift; so that even as it seeks to return to its origin unless replaced,
it gives the donor a mystic and dangerous hold over the recipient.

Logically, the hau explains only why gifts are repaid. It does not of
itself address the other imperatives into which Mauss decomposed the
process of reciprocity: the obligation to give in the first place, and
the obligation to receive. Yet by comparison with the obligation to
reciprocate, these aspects Mauss treated only summarily, and even then
in ways not always detached from the hau: “This rigorous combination of
symmetrical and opposed rights and duties ceases to appear contradictory
if one realizes that it consists above all of a melange of spiritual
bonds between things which are in some degree souls, and individuals and
groups which interact in some degree as things” (p. 163).

Meanwhile, the Maori hau is raised to the status of a general
explanation: the prototypical principle of reciprocity in Melanesia,
Polynesia, and the American northwest coast, the binding quality of the
Roman traditio, the key to gifts of cattle in Hindu India—“What you are,
I am; become on this day of your essence, in giving you I give myself”
(p. 248).

Everything depends then on the “texte capitale” collected by Elsdon Best
(1909) from the Maori sage, Tamati Ranapiri of the Ngati-Raukawa tribe.
The great role played by the hau in the Essay on the Gift—and the repute
it has enjoyed since in anthropological economics—stems almost entirely
from this passage. Here Ranapiri explained the hau of taonga, that is,
goods of the higher spheres of exchange, valuables. I append Best’s
translation of the Maori text (which he also published in the original),
as well as Mauss’s rendering in French.

  Best, 1909, p. 439                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mauss, 1966, pp. 158–159

  I will now speak of the hau, and the ceremony of whangai hau. That hau is not the hau (wind) that blows—not at all. I will carefully explain to you. Suppose that you possess a certain article, and you give that article to me, without price. We make no bargain over it. Now, I give that article to a third person, who, after some time has elapsed, decides to make some return for it, and so he makes me a present of some article. Now, that article that he gives me is the hau of the article I first received from you and then gave to him. The goods that I received for that item I must hand over to you. It would not be right for me to keep such goods for myself, whether they be desirable items or otherwise. I must hand them over to you, because they are a hau of the article you gave me. Were I to keep such an equivalent for myself, then some serious evil would befall me, even death. Such is the hau, the hau of personal property, or the forest hau. Enough on these points.   Je vais vous parler du hau.. . . Le hau n'est pas le vent qui souffle. Pas du tout. Supposez que vous possédez un article détermine (taonga) et que vous me donnez cet article; vous me le donnez sans prix fixe. Nous ne faisons pas de marché à ce propos. Or, je donne cet article à une troisième personne qui, après qu'un certain temps s'est écoulé, décide de rendre quelque chose en paiement (utu), il me fait présent de quelque chose (taonga). Or, ce taonga qui'il me donne est l'esprit (hau) du taonga que j'ai reçu de vous et que je lui ai donnés à lui. Les taonga que j'ai reçus pour ces taonga (venus de vous) il faut que je vous les rende. Il ne serait pas juste (tika) de ma part de garder ces taonga pour moi, qu'ils soient désirables (rawe), ou désagréables (kino). Je dois vous les donner car ils sont un hau du taonga que vous m'avez donné. Si je conservais ce deuxième taonga pour moi, il pourrait m'en venir du mal, sérieusement, même la mort. Tel est le hau, le hau de la propriété personnelle, le hau des taonga, le hau de la forêt. Kati ena. (Assez sur ce sujet.)

Mauss complained about Best’s abbreviation of a certain portion of the
original Maori. To make sure that we would miss nothing of this critical
document, and in the hope further meanings might be gleaned from it, I
asked Professor Bruce Biggs, distinguished student of the Maori, to
prepare a new interlinear translation, leaving the term “hau,” however,
in the original. To this request he responded most kindly and promptly
with the following version, undertaken without consulting Best’s
translation:²

Na, mo te hau o te ngaaherehere. Taua mea te hau, ehara i te mea Now,
concerning the hau of the forest. This hau is not the hau ko te hau e
pupuhi nei. Kaaore. Maaku e aata whaka maarama ki a koe. that blows (the
wind). No. I will explain it carefully to you. Na, he taonga toou ka
hoomai e koe mooku. Kaaore aa taaua whakaritenga Now, you have something
valuable which you give to me. We have no uto mo too taonga. Na, ka
hoatu hoki e ahau mo teetehi atu tangata, aa, agreement about payment.
Now, I give it to someone else, and, ka roa peaa te waa, aa, ka mahara
taua tangata kei a ia raa taug taonga a long time passes, and that man
thinks he has the valuable, kia hoomai he utu ki a au, aa, ka hoomai e
ia. Na, ko taua taonga he should give some repayment to me, and so he
does so. Now, that i hoomai nei ki a au, ko te hau teenaa o te taonga i
hoomai ra ki a au valuable which was given to me, that is the hau of the
valuable which was i mua. Ko taua taonga me hoatu e ahau ki a koe. E
kore given to me before. I must give it to you. It would not rawa e tika
kia kaiponutia e ahau mooku; ahakoa taonga pai rawa, taonga be correct
for me to keep it for myself, whether it be something very good, kino
raanei, me tae rawa taua taonga i a au ki a koe. No te mea he hau or
bad, that valuable must be given to you from me. Because that valuable

no te taonga teenaa taonga na. Ki te mea kai kaiponutia e ahau taua
taonga

is a hau of the other valuable. If I should hang onto that valuable

mooku, ka mate ahau. Koina te hau, hau taonga for myself, I will become
mate. So that is the hau—hau of valuables,

hau ngaaherehere. Kaata eenaa. hau of the forest. So much for that.

Concerning the text as Best recorded it, Mauss commented that— despite
marks of that “esprit théologique et juridique encore imprécis”
characteristic of Maori—“it offers but one obscurity: the intervention
of a third person.” But even this difficulty he forthwith clarified with
a light gloss:

But in order to rightly understand this Maori jurist, it suffices to
say: “Taonga and all strictly personal property have a hau, a spiritual
power. You give me a taonga, I give it to a third party, the latter
gives me another in return, because he is forced to do so by the hau of
my present; and I am obliged to give you this thing, for I must give
back to you what is in reality the product of the hau of your taonga.

(1966, p. 159)

Embodying the person of its giver and the hau of its forest, the gift
itself, on Mauss’s reading, obliges repayment. The receiver is beholden
by the spirit of the donor; the hau of a taonga seeks always to return
to its homeland, inexorably, even after being transferred hand to hand
through a series of transactions. Upon repaying, the original recipient
assumes power in turn over the first donor; hence, “la circulation
obligatoire des richesses, tributs et dons” in Samoa and New Zealand. In
sum:

. .. it is clear that in Maori custom, the bond of law, bond by way of
things, is a bond of souls, because the thing itself has a soul, is
soul. From this it follows that to present something to someone is to
present something of oneself. . .. It is clear that in this system of
ideas it is necessary to return unto another what is in reality part of
his nature and substance; for, to accept something from someone is to
accept something of his spiritual essence, of his soul; the retention of
this thing would be dangerous and mortal, not simply because it would be
illicit, but also because this thing which comes from a person, not only
morally but physically and spiritually—this essence, this food, these
goods, movable or immovable, these women or these offspring, these rites
or these communions—give a magical and religious hold over you. Finally,
this thing given is not inert. Animate, often personified, it seeks to
return to what Hertz called its “foyer d’origine”or to produce for the
clan and the earth from which it came some equivalent to take its place.

(op. cit., p. 161)


The Commentaries of Lévi-Strauss, Firth and Johansen

Mauss’s interpretation of the hau has been attacked by three scholars of
authority, two of them experts on the Maori and one an expert on Mauss.
Their critiques are surely learned, but none I think arrives at the true
meaning of the Ranapiri text or of the hau.

Lévi-Strauss debates principles. He does not presume to criticize Mauss
on Maori ethnography. He does, however, question the reliance on an
indigenous rationalization: “Are we not faced here with one of those
instances (not altogether rare) in which the ethnologist allows himself
to be mystified by the native?” (Lévi-Strauss, 1966, p. 38). The hau is
not the reason for exchange, only what one people happen to believe is
the reason, the way they represent to themselves an unconscious
necessity whose reason lies elsewhere. And behind Mauss’s fixation on
the hau, Lévi-Strauss perceived a general conceptual error that
regretably arrested his illustrious predecessor short of the full
structuralist comprehension of exchange that the Essay on the Gift had
itself so brilliantly prefigured: “like Moses leading his people to a
promised land of which he would never contemplate the splendor” (p. 37).
For Mauss had been the first in the history of ethnology to go beyond
the empirical to a deeper reality, to abandon the sensible and discrete
for the system of relations; in a unique manner he had perceived the
operation of reciprocity across its diverse and multiple modalities.
But, alas, Mauss could not completely escape from positivism. He
continued to understand exchange in the way it is presented to
experience—fragmented, that is to say, into the separate acts of giving,
receiving, and repaying. Considering it thus in pieces, instead of as a
unified and integral principle, he could do nothing better than to try
to glue it back again with this “mystic cement,” the hau.

Firth likewise has his own views on reciprocity, and in making them he
scores Mauss repeatedly on points of Maori ethnography (1959a, pp.
418–421). Mauss, according to Firth, simply misunderstood the hau, which
is a difficult and amorphous concept, but in any event a more passive
spiritual principle than Mauss believed. The Ranapiri text in fact gives
no evidence that the hau passionately strives to return to its source.
Nor did the Maori generally rely on the hau acting by itself to punish
economic delinquency. Normally in the event of a failure to reciprocate,
and invariably for theft, the established procedure of retribution or
restitution was witchcraft (makutu): witchcraft initiated by the person
who had been bilked, usually involving the services of a “priest”
(tohu-nga), if operating through the vehicle of the goods detained.³
Furthermore, adds Firth, Mauss confused types of hau that in the Maori
view are quite distinct—the hau of persons, that of lands and forests,
and that of taonga—and on the strength of this confusion he formulated a
serious error. Mauss simply had no warrant to gloss the hau of the
taonga as the hau of the person who gives it. The whole idea that the
exchange of gifts is an exchange of persons is sequitur to a basic
misinterpretation. Ranapiri had merely said that the good given by the
third person to the second was the hau of the thing received by the
second from the first.⁴ The hau of persons was not at issue. In
supposing it was, Mauss put his own intellectual refinements on Maori
mysticism.⁵ In other words, and Lévi-Strauss notwithstanding, it was not
a native rationalization after all; it was a kind of French one. But as
the Maori proverb says, “the troubles of other lands are their own”
(Best, 1922, p. 30).

Firth for his part prefers secular to spiritual explanations of
reciprocity. He would emphasize certain other sanctions of repayment,
sanctions noted by Mauss in the course of the Essay:

The fear of punishment sent through the hau of goods is indeed a
supernatural sanction, and a valuable one, for enforcing repayment of a
gift. But to attribute the scrupulousness in settling one’s obligations
to a belief in an active, detached fragment of personality of the donor,
charged with nostalgia and vengeful impulses, is an entirely different
matter. It is an abstraction which receives no support from native
evidence. The main emphasis of the fulfillment of obligation lies, as
the work of Mauss himself has suggested, in the social sanctions—the
desire to continue useful economic relations, the maintenance of
prestige and power—which do not require any hypothesis of recondite
beliefs to explain.

(1959a, p. 421)⁶

The latest to apply for entrance to the Maori “house of learning,” J.
Prytz Johansen (1954), makes certain clear advances over his
predecessors in the reading of the Ranapiri text. He at least is the
first to doubt that the old Maori had anything particularly spiritual in
mind when he spoke of the hau of a gift. Unfortunately, Johansen’s
discussion is even more labyrinthal than Tamati Ranapiri’s, and once
having reached the point he seems to let go, searches a mythical rather
than a logical explanation of the famous exchange à trois, and ends
finally on a note of scholarly despair.

After rendering due tribute and support to Firth’s critique of Mauss,
Johansen observes that the word hau has a very wide semantic field.
Probably several homonyms are involved. For the series of meanings
usually understood as “life principle” or something of the sort,
Johansen prefers as a general definition, “a part of life (for example,
an object) which is used ritually in order to influence the whole,” the
thing serving as hau varying according to the ritual context. He then
makes a point that hitherto had escaped everyone’s notice—including, I
think, Best’s. Tamati Ranapiri’s discourse on gifts was by way of
introduction to and explanation of a certain ceremony, a sacrificial
repayment to the forest for the game birds taken by Maori fowlers.⁷ Thus
the informant’s purpose in this expositing passage was merely to
establish the principle of reciprocity, and “hau” there merely signified
“countergift”—“the Maori in question undoubtedly thought that hau means
countergift, simply what is otherwise called utu”(Johansen, 1954, p.
118).

We shall see momentarily that the notion of “equivalent return” (utu) is
inadequate for the hau in question; moreover, the issues posed by
Ranapiri transcend reciprocity as such. In any event, Johansen, upon
taking up again the three-party transaction, dissipated the advance he
had made. Unaccountably, he credited the received understanding that the
original donor performs magic on the second party through the goods the
latter received from the third, goods that become hau in this context.
But since the explication is “not obvious,” Johansen found himself
compelled to invoke a special unknown tradition, “to the effect that
when three persons exchanged gifts and the intermediary party failed,
the counter-gift which had stopped with him might be hau, i.e., might be
used to bewitch him.” He then finished gloomily: “However a certain
uncertainty is involved in all these considerations and it seems
doubtful whether we shall ever attain to actual certainty as regards the
meaning of the hau” (ibid., p. 118).

The True Meaning of The Hau of Valuables

I am not a linguist, a student of primitive religions, an expert on the
Maori, or even a Talmudic scholar. The “certainty” I see in the disputed
text of Tamati Ranapiri is therefore suggested with due reservations.
Still, to adopt the current structuralist incantation, “everything
happens as if” the Maori was trying to explain a religious concept by an
economic principle, which Mauss promptly understood the other way around
and thereupon proceeded to develop the economic principle by the
religious concept. The hau in question really means something on the
order of “return on” or “product of,” and the principle expressed in the
text on taonga is that any such yield on a gift ought to be handed over
to the original donor.

The disputed text absolutely should be restored to its position as an
explanatory gloss to the description of a sacrifical rite.⁸ Tamata
Ranapiri was trying to make Best understand by this example of gift
exchange— example so ordinary that anybody (or any Maori) ought to be
able to grasp it immediately—why certain game birds are ceremoniously
returned to the hau of the forest, to the source of their abundance. In
other words, he adduced a transaction among men parallel to the ritual
transaction he was about to relate, such that the former would serve as
paradigm for the latter. As a matter of fact, the secular transaction
does not prove directly comprehensible to us, and the best way to
understand it is to work backwards from the exchange logic of the
ceremony.

This logic, as presented by Tamati Ranapiri, is perfectly
straightforward. It is necessary only to observe the sage’s use of
“mauri” as the physical embodiment of the forest hau, the power of
increase—a mode of conceiving the mauri that is not at all
idiosyncratic, to judge from other writings of Best. The mauri, housing
the hau, is placed in the forest by the priests (tohunga) to make game
birds abound. Here then is the passage that followed that on the gift
exchange—in the intention of the informant, as night follows day:⁹

I will explain something to you about the forest hau. The mauri was
placed or implanted in the forest by the tohunga [priests]. It is the
mauri that causes birds to be abundant in the forest, that they may be
slain and taken by man. These birds are the property of, or belong to,
the mauri, the tohunga, and the forest: that is to say, they are an
equivalent for that important item, the mauri. Hence it is said that
offerings should be made to the hau of the forest. The tohunga (priests,
adepts) eat the offering because the mauri is theirs: it was they who
located it in the forest, who caused it to be. That is why some of the
birds cooked at the sacred fire are set apart to be eaten by the priests
only, in order that the hau of the forest-products, and the mauri, may
return again to the forest—that is, to the mauri. Enough of these
matters.

(Best, 1909, p. 439)

In other words, and essentially: the mauri that holds the increase-power
(hau) is placed in the forest by the priests (tohunga); the mauri causes
game birds to abound; accordingly, some of the captured birds should be
ceremoniously returned to the priests who placed the mauri; the
consumption of these birds by the priests in effect restores the
fertility (hau) of the forest (hence the name of the ceremony, whangai
hau, “nourishing hau”).¹⁰ Immediately then, the ceremonial transaction
presents a familiar appearance: a three-party game, with the priests in
the position of an initiating donor to whom should be rendered the
returns on an original gift. The cycle of exchange is shown in Figure
4.1.

[Figure 4.1]

Figure 4.1

Now, in the light of this transaction, reconsider the text, just
preceding, on gifts among men. Everything becomes transparent. The
secular exchange of taonga is only slightly different in form from the
ceremonial offering of birds, while in principle it is exactly the same—
thus the didactic value of its position in Ranapiri’s discourse. A gives
a gift to B who transforms it into something else in an exchange with C,
but since the taonga given by C to B is the product (hau) of A’s
original gift, this benefit ought to be surrendered to A. The cycle is
shown in Figure 4.2.

[Figure 4.2]

Figure 4.2

The meaning of hau one disengages from the exchange of taonga is as
secular as the exchange itself. If the second gift is the hau of the
first, then the hau of a good is its yield, just as the hau of a forest
is its productiveness. Actually, to suppose Tamati Ranapiri meant to say
the gift has a spirit which forces repayment seems to slight the old
gentleman’s obvious intelligence. To illustrate such a spirit needs only
a game of two persons: you give something to me; your spirit (hau) in
that thing obliges me to reciprocate. Simple enough. The introduction of
a third party could only unduly complicate and obscure the point. But if
the point is neither spiritual nor reciprocity as such, if it is rather
that one man’s gift should not be another man’s capital, and therefore
the fruits of a gift ought to be passed back to the original holder,
then the introduction of a third party is necessary. It is necessary
precisely to show a turnover: the gift has had issue; the recipient has
used it to advantage. Ranapiri was careful to prepare this notion of
advantage beforehand by stipulating¹¹ the absence of equivalence in the
first instance, as if A had given B a free gift. He implies the same,
moreover, in stressing the delay between the reception of the gift by
the third person and the repayment—“a long time passes, and that man
thinks that he has the valuable, he should give some repayment to me.”
As Firth observes, delayed repayments among Maori are customarily larger
than the initial gift (1959a, p. 422); indeed, it is a general rule of
Maori gift exchange that, “the payment must if possible be somewhat in
excess of what the principle of equivalence demanded” (ibid., p. 423).
Finally, observe just where the term hau enters into the discussion. Not
with the initial transfer from the first to the second party, as well it
could if it were the spirit in the gift, but upon the exchange between
the second and third parties, as logically it would if it were the yield
on the gift.¹² The term “profit” is economically and historically
inappropriate to the Maori, but it would have been a better translation
than “spirit” for the hau in question.

Best provides one other example of exchange in which hau figures.
Significantly, the little scene is again a transaction à trois:

I was having a flax shoulder-cape made by a native woman at Rua-tahuna.
One of the troopers wished to buy it from the weaver, but she firmly
refused, lest the horrors of hau whitia descend upon her. The term hau
whitia means “averted hau.”

(1900–1901, p. 198)

Only slightly different from the model elaborated by Tamati Ranapiri,
this anecdote offers no particular difficulty. Having commissioned the
cape, Best had the prior claim on it. Had the weaver accepted the
trooper’s offer, she would have turned this thing to her own advantage,
leaving Best with nothing. She appropriates the product of Best’s cape;
she becomes subject to the evils of a gain unrightfully turned aside,
“the horrors of hau whitia.” ¹³ Otherwise said, she is guilty of eating
hau—kai hau—for in the introduction to this incident Best had explained,

Should I dispose of some article belonging to another person and not
hand over to him any return or payment I may have received for that
article, that is a hau whitia and my act is a kai hau, and death awaits,
for the dread terrors of makutu [witchcraft] will be turned upon me.

(1900–1901, pp. 197–98)¹⁴

So as Firth observed, the hau (even if it were a spirit) does not cause
harm on its own initiative; the distinct procedure of witchcraft
(makutu) has to be set in motion. It is not even implied by this
incident that such witchcraft would work through the passive medium of
hau, since Best, who was potentially the deceived party, had apparently
put nothing tangible into circulation. Taken together, the different
texts on the hau of gifts suggest something else entirely: not that the
goods withheld are dangerous, but that withholding goods is immoral—and
therefore dangerous in the sense the deceiver is open to justifiable
attack. “It would not be correct to keep it for myself,” said Ranapiri,
“I will become mate (ill, or die).”

We have to deal with a society in which freedom to gain at others’
expense is not envisioned by the relations and forms of exchange.
Therein lies the moral of the old Maori’s economic fable. The issue he
posed went beyond reciprocity: not merely that gifts must be suitably
returned, but that returns rightfully should be given back. This
interpretation it is possible to sustain by a judicious selection among
the many meanings of hau entered in H. Williams’s (1921) Maori
dictionary. Hau is a verb meaning to “exceed, be in excess,” as
exemplified in the phrase kei te hau te wharika nei (“this mat is longer
than necessary”); likewise, hau is the substantive, “excess, parts,
fraction over any complete measurement.” Hau is also “property, spoils.”
Then there is haumi, a derivative meaning to “join,” to “lengthen by
addition,” to “receive or lay aside”; it is also, as a noun, “the piece
of wood by which the body of a canoe is lengthened.” The following is
the true meaning of Tamati Ranapiri’s famous and enigmatic discourse on
the hau of taonga:

I will explain it carefully to you. Now, you have something valuable
which you give to me. We have no agreement about payment. Now, I give it
to someone else, and, a long time passes, and that man thinks he has the
valuable, he should give some repayment to me, and so he does so. Now,
that valuable which was given to me, that is the product of [hau] the
valuable which was given to me [by you] before. I must give it to you.
It would not be right for me to keep it for myself, whether it be
something good, or bad, that valuable must be given to you from me.
Because that valuable is a return on [hau] the other valuable. If I
should hang onto that valuable for myself, I will become ill

[or die].

Aside on The Maori Sorcerer's Apprentice

But this understanding of the hau of things still risks criticism on its
own grounds—of omission, of failure to consider the total context. Both
passages, on gifts and on sacrifice, are parts of a yet larger whole,
preceeded by still another disquisition on mauri as taken by Best from
the lips of Ranapiri (1909, pp. 440–441). True, there may be good reason
for leaving this particular prelude aside. Highly obscure, esoteric,
concerned mainly with the nature and teaching of death-dealing spells,
it seems to have no great bearing on exchange:

The mauri is a spell which is recited over a certain object, of stone,
or of wood, or something else approved of by the tohunga [priest] as a
“clinging place,” a “holding-fast-place,” a “dwelling-place” for the
mauri. Such an object is subjected to the “cause-to-be-split” ritual,
and left in a hidden part of the forest to lie there. The mauri is not
tapu-less. Also it is not the case that all of the forest is as tapu as
the part where the mauri lies. Concerning the causing-to-be-split, it is
a shattering. If a man is taught by a priest certain spells, say
witchcraft spells, or spells for placing mauri, and the other Maori
spells, and he learns them, then the priest says to that man, “Now,
there, ‘cause-to-be-split’ your spells!” That is, be-spell the stone so
that it is shattered, the man so that he dies, or whatever. If the stone
is smashed, or the man dies, the spells of that pupil have become very
mana. If the stone does not burst (shatter), or the man die, which has
been “caused-to-be-split,” his spells are not mana. They will return and
kill him, the pupil. If the priest is very old and near to death, that
priest will say, to his pupil to “cause-to-be-split” his spells against
him, that is, the priest. The priest dies, so his spells are “split”
(shattered) which he taught, and are mana. Then the pupil lives, and, in
due time, he will want to place a mauri. Now, he is able to place (it)
in the forest, or in the water, or on the post of the eel-weir which is
called pou-reinga. It would not be good for the spells of that pupil to
remain within him, to be not split, that is shattered forth, and, it is
the shattering forth, which is the same as shatter the stone. If the
stone shatters completely, that is good. That is the “causing-to-split.”

(Bigg’s translation)

No question that the previous examination of gift and ceremonial
exchange leaves us merely unprepared to understand the profondeurs of
this section. Yet the text again speaks of an exchange, which even
superficial study will recognize as formally analogous to the
transactions of taonga and “nourishing hau.” The spell passed by priest
to student returns to the former enhanced in value and by way of a third
party. It may very well be that the three sections of the Ranapiri text
are variations on the same theme, unified not only in content but by a
triple replication of the same transactional structure.¹⁵

The case is strengthened by a precious datum, again explicated by Firth
(1959a, pp. 272–273), apparently from materials supplied by Best (1925a,
pp. 1101–1104). Comparing Maori custom with common Melanesian practice
in regard to the transmission of magic, Firth was struck by the virtual
absence among Maori of any obligation to repay the teacher. In the Maori
view, such recompense would degrade the spell, even defile and render it
null—with a single exception. The Maori teacher of the most tapu black
magic was repaid—by a victim! The apprentice would have to kill a near
relative, an act of sacrifice to the gods that empowered the spell even
as it restored the gift (Best, 1925a, p. 1063). Or perhaps, as the
tohunga grew old the death-dealing knowledge would be directed back upon
him—proving, incidentally, that scholarly cults are the same all over.
Best’s description of these customs has exactly the transactional
cadence of the passage on gifts, beginning on the same note of
nonreturn:

The old men of Tuhoe and Awa explain it this way: The priest teacher was
not paid for his services. If he were, then the arts of magic, etc.,
acquired by the pupil would not be effectual. He would not be able to
slay a person by means of magical spells. But, if you are taught by me,
then I will tell you what to do in order to reveal your powers. I will
tell you the price that you must pay for your initiation, as—“The
equivalent for your knowledge acquired, the disclosing of your powers,
must be your own father,” or your mother, or some other near relative.
Then such powers will be effective. The teacher mentions the price the
pupil must pay. He selects a near relative of the pupil as the greatest
sacrifice he can pay for his acquirements. A near relative, possibly his
own mother, is brought before him, that he may slay her by means of his
magical powers. In some cases the teacher would direct his pupil to so
slay him, the teacher. Ere long he would be dead.. . . “The payment made
by the pupil was the loss of a near relative. As to a payment in
goods—what would be the good of that. Hai aha!”

(Best, 1925a, p. 1103)

[Figure 4.3]

Figure 4.3

This detail in hand, the morphological resemblance between all three
parts of the Ranapiri text becomes unmistakable. In the transmission of
tapu magic, as in the exchange of valuables or the sacrifice of birds, a
direct return on the initial gift is excluded. In each instance,
reciprocation passes by way of a third party. This mediation in every
case brings issue to the original gift: by the transfer from the second
party to the third, some value or effect is added to the thing given by
the first party to the second. And one way or another, the first
recipient (middle term) is menaced by destruction (mate) if the cycle is
not completed. Concretely in the text on magic: the tohunga gives the
spell to the apprentice; the apprentice turns it upon the victim, so
enhancing it if he is successful—“the spells of that pupil have become
very mana ”—or dying himself if he fails; the victim belongs to the
tohunga as compensation for his teaching; alternatively, the apprentice
returns his now powerful spell to the aged tohunga, that is, he kills
him. The cycle is shown in Figure 4.3.

The Larger Significance of Hau

Returning now to the hau, it is clear we cannot leave the term merely
with secular connotations. If the hau of valuables in circulation means
the yield thereby accrued, a concrete product of a concrete good, still
there is a hau of the forest, and of man, and these do have spiritual
quality. What kind of spiritual quality? Many of Best’s remarks on the
subject suggest that the hau-as-spirit is not unrelated to the
hau-as-material-returns. Taking the two together, one is able to reach a
larger understanding of that mysterious hau.

Immediately it is clear that hau is not a spirit in the common animistic
sense. Best is explicit about this. The hau of a man is a quite
different thing from his wairua, or sentient spirit—the “soul” of
ordinary anthropological usage. I cite from one of Best’s most
comprehensive discussions of wairua:

In the term wairua (soul) we have the Maori term for what
anthropologists style the soul, that is the spirit that quits the body
at death, and proceeds to the spirit world, or hovers about its former
home here on earth. The word wairua denotes a shadow, any unsubstantial
image; occasionally it is applied to a reflection, thus it was adopted
as a name for the animating spirit of man.. . . The wairua can leave the
sheltering body during life; it does so when a person dreams of seeing
distant places or people.. . . The wairua is held to be a sentient
spirit; it leaves the body during sleep, and warns its physical basis of
impending dangers, of ominous signs, by means of the visions we term
dreams. It was taught by high-grade native priests that all things
possess a wairua, even what we term inanimate objects, as trees and
stones.

(Best, 1924, vol. 1, pp. 299–301)¹⁶

Hau, on the other hand, belongs more to the realm of animatism than
animism. As such it is bound up with mauri, in fact, in the writings of
the ethnographic experts, it is virtually impossible to distinguish one
from the other. Firth despairs of definitively separating the two on the
basis of Best’s overlapping and often corresponding definitions—“the
blurred outline of the distinction drawn between hau and mauri by our
most eminent ethnographic authority allows one to conclude that these
concepts in their immaterial sense are almost synonymous” (Firth, 1959a,
p. 281). As Firth notices, certain contrasts sometimes appear. In
reference to man, the mauri is the more active principle, “the activity
that moves within us.” In relation to land or the forest, “mauri” is
frequently used for the tangible representation of an incorporeal hau.
Yet is is clear that “mauri” too may refer to a purely spiritual quality
of land, and, on the other hand, the hau of a person may have concrete
form—for example, hair, nail clippings, and the like used in witchcraft.
It is not for me to unscramble these linguistic and religious mysteries,
so characteristic of that Maori “esprit théologique et juridique encore
imprécis.” Rather, I would emphasize a more apparent and gross contrast
between hau and mauri, on one side, and wairua on the other, a contrast
that also seems to clarify the learned words of Tamati Ranapiri.

Hau and mauri as spiritual qualities are uniquely associated with
fecundity. Best often spoke of both as the “vital principle.” It is
evident from many of his observations that fertility and productivity
were the essential attributes of this “vitality.” For example (the
italics in the following statements are mine):

The hau of land is its vitality, fertility and so forth, and also a
quality which we can only, I think, express by the word prestige.

(Best, 1900–1901, p. 193)

The ahi taitai is a sacred fire at which rites are performed that have
for their purpose the protection of the life principle and fruitfulness
of man, the land, forests, birds, etc. It is said to be the mauri or hau
of the home.

(p. 194)

. .. when Hape went off on his expedition to the south, he took with him
the hau of the kumara [sweet potato], or, as some say, he took the mauri
of the same. The visible form of this mauri was the stalk of a kumara
plant, it represented the hau, that is to say, the vitality and
fertility of the kumara.

(p. 196; cf. Best, 1925b, pp. 106–107)

The forest mauri has already received our attention. We have shown that
its function was to protect the productiveness of the forest.

(p. 6)

Material mauri were utilized in connection with agriculture; they were
placed in the field where crops were planted, and it was a firm belief
that they had a highly beneficial effect on the growing crops.

(1922, p. 38)

Now, the hau and mauri pertain not only to man, but also to animals,
land, forests and even to a village home. Thus the hau or vitality, or
productiveness, of a forest has to be very carefully protected by means
of certain very peculiar rites . .. For fecundity cannot exist without
the essential hau.

(1909, p. 436)

Everything animate and inanimate possesses this life principle (mauri):
without it naught could flourish.

(1924, vol. 1, p. 306)

So, as we had in fact already suspected, the hau of the forest is its
fecundity, as the hau of a gift is its material yield. Just as in the
mundane context of exchange hau is the return on a good, so as a
spiritual quality hau is the principle of fertility. In the one equally
as in the other, the benefits taken by man ought to be returned to their
source, that it may be maintained as a source. Such was the total wisdom
of Tamati Ranapiri.

“Everything happens as if” the Maori people knew a broad concept, a
general principle of productiveness, hau. It was a category that made no
distinctions, of itself belonging neither to the domain we call
“spiritual” nor that of the “material,” yet applicable to either.
Speaking of valuables, the Maori could conceive hau as the concrete
product of exchange. Speaking of the forest, hau was what made the game
birds abound, a force unseen but clearly appreciated by the Maori. But
would the Maori in any case need to so distinguish the “spiritual” and
the “material”? Does not the apparent “imprecision” of the term hau
perfectly accord with a society in which “economic,” “social,”
“political” and “religious” are indiscriminately organized by the same
relations and intermixed in the same activities? And if so, are we not
obliged once more to reverse ourselves on Mauss’s interpretation?
Concerning the spiritual specifics of the hau, he was very likely
mistaken. But in another sense, more profound, he was right. “Everything
happens as if ” hau were a total concept. Kaati eenaa.


Political Philosophy of the Essay on the Gift

For the war of every man against every man, Mauss substitutes the
exchange of everything between everybody. The hau, spirit of the donor
in the gift, was not the ultimate explanation of reciprocity, only a
special proposition set in the context of an historic conception. Here
was a new version of the dialogue between chaos and covenant, transposed
from the explication of political society to the reconciliation of
segmentary society. The Essai sur le don is a kind of social contract
for the primitives.

Like famous philosophical predecessors, Mauss debates from an original
condition of disorder, in some sense given and pristine, but then
overcome dialectically. As against war, exchange. The transfer of things
that are in some degree persons and of persons in some degree treated as
things, such is the consent at the base of organized society. The gift
is alliance, solidarity, communion—in brief, peace, the great virtue
that earlier philosophers, Hobbes notably, had discovered in the State.
But the originality and the verity of Mauss was exactly that he refused
the discourse in political terms. The first consent is not to authority,
or even to unity. It would be too literal an interpretation of the older
contract theory to discover its verification in nascent institutions of
chieftainship. The primitive analogue of social contract is not the
State, but the gift.

The gift is the primitive way of achieving the peace that in civil
society is secured by the State. Where in the traditional view the
contract was a form of political exchange, Mauss saw exchange as a form
of political contract. The famous “total prestation” is a “total
contract,” described to just this effect in the Manuel d’Ethnographie:

We shall differentiate contracts into those of total prestation and
contracts in which the prestation is only partial. The former already
appear in Australia; they are found in a large part of the Polynesian
world . .. and in North America. For two clans, total prestation is
manifest by the fact that to be in a condition of perpetual contract,
everyone owes everything to all the others of his clan and to all those
of the opposed clan. The permanent and collective character of such a
contract makes it a veritable traite, with the necessary display of
wealth vis-a-vis the other party. The prestation is extended to
everything, to everyone, at all times.. . .

(1967, p. 188)

But as gift exchange, the contract would have a completely new political
realization, unforeseen and unimagined in the received philosophy and
constituting neither society nor State. For Rousseau, Locke, Spinoza,
Hobbes, the social contract had been first of all a pact of society. It
was an agreement of incorporation: to form a community out of previously
separate and antagonistic parts, a superperson of the individual
persons, that would exercise the power subtracted from each in the
benefit of all. But then, a certain political formation had to be
stipulated. The purpose of the unification was to put an end to the
strife born of private justice. Consequently, even if the covenant was
not as such a contract of government, between ruler and ruled, as in
medieval and earlier versions, and whatever the differences between the
sages over the locus of sovereignty, all had to imply by the contract of
society the institution of State. That is to say, all had to insist on
the alienation by agreement of one right in particular: private force.
This was the essential clause, despite that the philosophers went on to
debate its comprehensiveness: the surrender of private force in favor of
a Public Power.

The gift, however, would not organize society in a corporate sense, only
in a segmentary sense. Reciprocity is a “between” relation. It does not
dissolve the separate parties within a higher unity, but on the
contrary, in correlating their opposition, perpetuates it. Neither does
the gift specify a third party standing over and above the separate
interests of those who contract. Most important, it does not withdraw
their force, for the gift affects only will and not right. Thus the
condition of peace as understood by Mauss—and as in fact it exists in
the primitive societies—has to differ politically from that envisioned
by the classic contract, which is always a structure of submission, and
sometimes of terror. Except for the honor accorded to generosity, the
gift is no sacrifice of equality and never of liberty. The groups allied
by exchange each retain their strength, if not the inclination to use
it.

Although I opened with Hobbes (and it is especially in comparison with
Leviathan¹⁷ that I would discuss The Gift), it is clear that in
sentiment Mauss is much closer to Rousseau. By its segmentary
morphology, Mauss’s primitive society rather returns to the third stage
of the Discourse on Inequality than to the radical individualism of a
Hobbesian state of nature (cf. Cazaneuvc, 1968). And as Mauss and
Rousseau had similarly seen the oppositions as social, so equally their
resolutions would be sociable. That is, for Mauss, an exchange that
“extends to everything, to everyone, to all time.” What is more, if in
giving one gives himself (hau), then everyone spiritually becomes a
member of everyone else. In other words, the gift approaches even in its
enigmas that celebrated contract in which, “Chacun de nous met en commun
sa personne et toute sa puissance sous la suprême direction de la
volonté générale; et nous recevons en corps chaque membre comme partie
indivisible du tout.”

But if Mauss is a spiritual descendant of Rousseau, as a political
philosopher he is akin to Hobbes. Not to claim a close historic relation
with the Englishman, of course, but only to detect a strong convergence
in the analysis: a basic agreement on the natural political state as a
generalized distribution of force, on the possibility of escaping from
this condition by the aid of reason, and on the advantages realized
thereby in cultural progress. The comparison with Hobbes seems to best
bring out the almost concealed scheme of The Gift. Still, the exercise
would have little interest were it not that this “problématique”
precisely at the point it makes juncture with Hobbes arrives at a
fundamental discovery of the primitive polity, and where it differs from
Hobbes it makes a fundamental advance in understanding social evolution.

Political Aspects of The Gift and Leviathan

In the perspective of Mauss, as it was for Hobbes, the understructure of
society is war. This in a special sense, which is sociological.

The “war of every man against every man,” spectacular phrase, conceals
an ambiguity; or at least in its insistence on the nature of man it
ignores an equally striking structure of society. The state of nature
described by Hobbes was also a political order. True that Hobbes was
preoccupied with the human thirst for power and disposition to violence,
but he wrote too of an allocation of force among men and of their
liberty to employ it. The transition in Leviathan from the psychology of
man to the pristine condition seems therefore at the same time
continuous and disjunctive. The state of nature was sequitur to human
nature, but it also announced a new level of reality that as polity was
not even describable in the terms of psychology. This war of each
against all is not just the disposition to use force but the right to do
so, not merely certain inclinations but certain relations of power, not
simply a passion for supremacy but a sociology of dominance, not only
the instinct of competition but the legitimacy of the confrontation. The
state of nature is already a kind of society.¹⁸

What kind? According to Hobbes, it is a society without a sovereign,
without “a common Power to keep them all in awe.” Said positively, a
society in which the right to give battle is retained by the people in
severalty. But this must be underlined: it is the right which endures,
not the battle. The emphasis is Hobbes’s own, in a very important
passage that carried the war of nature beyond human violence to the
level of structure, where rather than fighting it appears as a period of
time, during which there is no assurance to contrary, and the will to
contend is sufficiently known:

For warre, consisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but
in a tract of time, wherein the Will to contend by Battell is
sufficiently known: and therefore the notion of Time, is to be
considered in the nature of Warre; as it is in the nature of Weather.
For as the nature of Foule weather, lyeth not in a shower or two of
rain; but in an inclination thereto of many dayes together; So the
nature of Warre, consisteth not in actual fighting; but in the known
disposition thereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the
contrary. All other time is peace.

(Part I, Chapter 13)

Happily, Hobbes frequently used the archaic spelling, “Warre,” which
gives us the opportunity of taking it to mean something else, a
determinate political form. To repeat, the critical characteristic of
Warre is free recourse to force: everyone reserves that option in
pursuit of his greater gain or glory, and in defense of his person and
possessions. Unless and until this partite strength was rendered to a
collective authority, Hobbes argued, there would never be assurance of
peace; and though Mauss discovered that assurance in the gift, both
agreed that the primitive order is an absence of law; which is the same
as saying that everyone can take the law into his own hands, so that man
and society stand in continuous danger of a violent end.

Of course, Hobbes did not seriously consider the state of nature as ever
a general empirical fact, an authentic historic stage—although there are
some people who “live to this day in that brutish manner,” as the
savages of many places in America, ignorant of all government beyond the
lustful concord of the small family. But if not historical, in what
sense was the state of nature intended?

In the sense of Galilean logic, it is sometimes said: a thinking away of
the distorting factors in a complex appearance to the ideal course of a
body moving without resistance. The analogy is close, but insofar as it
slights the tension and the stratification of the complex appearance, it
perhaps does not do justice, neither to Hobbes nor to the parallel in
Mauss. This “Warre” does exist, if it is only that people “lock their
doors behind” and princes are in “constant jealousy.” Yet though it
exists, it has to be imagined because all appearance is designed to
repress it, to overlay and deny it as an insupportable menace. So it is
imagined in a way that seems more like psychoanalysis than physics: by
probing for a hidden substructure that in outward behavior is disguised
and transfigured into its opposite. In that event, the deduction of the
pristine state is not a direct extension of experimental approximations,
still consistent with the empirical even as it is projected beyond the
observable. The real is here counterposed to the empirical, and we are
forced to understand the appearance of things as the negation rather
than the expression of their truer character.

In just this manner, it seems to me, Mauss posited his general theory of
the gift on a certain nature of primitive society, nature not always
evident—but that exactly because it is contradicted by the gift. It was,
moreover, a society of the same nature: Warre. The primitive order is a
contrived agreement to deny its inherent fragility, its division at base
into groups of distinct interest and matched strength, clanic groups
“like the savage people in many places of America,” that can join only
in conflict or else must withdraw to avoid it. Of course, Mauss did not
begin from Hobbesian principles of psychology. His view of human nature
is certainly more nuanced than that “perpetuall and restless desire of
Power after power, that ceaseth only in Death.”¹⁹ But his view of social
nature was an anarchy of group poised against group with a will to
contend by battle that is sufficiently known, and a disposition thereto
during all that time there is no assurance to the contrary. In the
context of this argument, the hau is only a dependent proposition. That
supposed adoption by the ethnologist of a native rationalization is
itself, by the scheme of The Gift, the rationalization of a deeper
necessity to reciprocate whose reason lies elsewhere: in threat of war.
The compulsion to reciprocate built into the hau responds to the
repulsion of groups built into the society. The force of attraction in
things thus dominates the attractions of force among men.

Less spectacular and sustained than the argument from hau, that from
Warre nevertheless reappears persistently in The Gift. For Warre is
contained in the premises, constructed by Mauss in the very definition
of “total prestation”: those exchanges, “undertaken in seemingly
voluntary guise . . . but in essence strictly obligatory, on pain of
private or open warfare” (1966, p. 151; emphasis mine). Similarly: “To
refuse to give or to fail to invite is, like refusing to accept,
equivalent to a declaration of war; it is to refuse alliance and
communion” (pp. 162–163).

Perhaps it strains the point to insist on Mauss’s appreciation of the
potlatch as a sort of sublimated warfare. Let us pass on to the
concluding paragraphs of the essay, where the opposition between Warre
and exchange is developed with progressive amplitude and clarity, first
in the metaphor of the Pine Mountain Corroboree, finally in a general
statement that begins . . .

All the societies we have described above, except our own European, are
segmentary societies. Even the Indo-Europeans, the Romans before the
Twelve Tables, the Germanic societies until very late—up to the
Edda—Irish society until the time of its principal literature, all were
still based on clans, or at the least great families, more or less
undivided internally and isolated from one another externally. All these
societies are or were far removed from our own degree of unification, as
well as from that unity with which they are endowed by inadequate
historical study.

(1966, p. 277)

From this organization, a time of exaggerated fear and hostility,
appears an equally exaggerated generosity:

When, during tribal feasts and ceremonies of rival clans and of families
that intermarry or initiate reciprocally, groups visit each other; even
when, among more advanced societies—with a developed law of
“hospitality”—the law of friendship and contracts with the gods have
come to assure the “peace” of the “market” and the towns; for a very
long period of time and in a considerable number of societies, men
confront each other in a curious frame of mind, of exaggerated fear and
hostility and of generosity equally exaggerated, which is however mad in
no one’s eyes but our own.

(p. 277)

So the people “come to terms” (traiter), happy phrase whose double
meaning of peace and exchange perfectly epitomizes the primitive
contract:

In all the societies that have immediately preceeded ours and that still
surround us, and even in numerous usages of our own popular morality,
there is no middle way: either complete trust or complete mistrust. One
lays down one’s arms, renounces magics and gives everything away from
casual hospitality to one’s daughters and goods. It is in conditions of
this kind that men put aside their self-concern and learnt to engage in
giving and returning. But then they had no choice. Two groups of men
that meet can only withdraw—or in case of mistrust or defiance,
battle—or else come to terms.

(p. 277)

By the end of the essay, Mauss had left far behind the mystic forests of
Polynesia. The obscure forces of hau were forgotten for a different
explanation of reciprocity, consequent on the more general theory, and
the opposite of all mystery and particularity: Reason. The gift is
Reason. It is the triumph of human rationality over the folly of war—

It is by opposing reason to emotion, by setting up the will for peace
against rash follies of this kind, that peoples succeed in substituting
alliance, gift and commerce for war, isolation and stagnation.

(p. 278)

I stress not only this“reason,” but the “isolation” and “stagnation.”
Composing society, the gift was the liberation of culture. Oscillating
permanently between confrontation and dispersion, the segmentary society
is otherwise brutish and static. But the gift is progress. That is its
supreme advantage—and Mauss’s final appeal:

Societies have progressed in the measure that they themselves, their
subgroups and finally their individuals have been able to stabilize
their relations, to give, receive, and to repay. In order to trade it
was necessary first to lay down the spear. It is then that one succeeded
in exchanging goods and persons, not only between clan and clan, but
between tribe and tribe, nation and nation, and, above all, between
individuals. It is only consequently that people became capable of
mutually creating and satisfying their interests, and finally of
defending them without recourse to arms. It is thus that clans, tribes,
peoples have learned—and it is thus that tomorrow in our world called
civilized the classes, nations, and also individuals must learn—how to
oppose without massacring one another, and how to give without
sacrificing one to another.

(pp. 278–279)

The “incommodities” of the Hobbesian state of nature had been likewise a
lack of progress. And society was similarly condemned to stagnation.
Here Hobbes brilliantly anticipated a later ethnology. Without the State
(commonwealth) he is saying, lacking special institutions of integration
and control, culture must remain primitive and uncomplicated—just as, in
the biological realm, the organism had to remain relatively
undifferentiated until the appearance of a central nervous system. In
some degree, Hobbes even went beyond modern ethnology, which still only
in an unconscious way, and without serious attempt to justify its
decision, is content to see in the formation of the state the great
evolutionary divide between “primitive” and “civilized,” while in the
meantime subjecting that famous passage of Hobbes’s where it is
explained just why the criterion is good, to nasty, brutish and short
burlesques. Hobbes at least gave a functional justification of the
evolutionary distinction, and an indication that qualitative change
would alter the quantity:

The incommodities of such a Warre. Whatsoever therefore is consequent to
a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is
consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than
what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them
withall. In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the
fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no Culture of the Earth, no
Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no
commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things
as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account
of Time, no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all,
continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man,
solitary, poore, nasty, brutish and short.

(Part I, Chapter 13)

But to pursue the resemblance to Mauss, from this insecurity and poverty
man seeks to escape: for reasons largely of emotion, according to
Hobbes, but by means strictly of reason. Menaced by material deprivation
and haunted by fear of violent death, men would incline to reason, which
“suggesteth certain convenient Articles of Peace, upon which men may be
drawn to agreement.” Thus Hobbes’s well-known Laws of Nature, which are
counsels of reason in the interest of preservation, and of which the
first and fundamental is “to seek Peace, and follow it.”

And because the condition of Man, (as hath been declared in the
precedent Chapter) is a condition of Warre of every one against
everyone; in which case every one is governed by his own Reason; and
there is nothing he can make use of, that may not be a help unto him, in
preserving his life against his enemyes; It followeth, that in such a
condition, every man has a Right to every thing; even to one another’s
body, And therefore, as long as this naturall Right of every man to
every thing endureth, there can be no security to any man, (how strong
or wise soever he be,) of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily
alloweth men to live. And consequently it is a precept, or generall rule
of Reason, That every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has
hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek,
and use, all helps, and advantages of Warre. The first branch of which
Rule, containeth the first, and Fundamentall Law of Nature; which is, to
seek Peace, and follow it.

(Part I, Chapter 14)

That Hobbes had even foreseen the peace of the gift is too strong a
claim. But this first law of nature was followed by eighteen others, all
in effect designed to realize the injunction that men seek peace, and
the second through fifth in particular founded on the same principle of
reconciliation of which the gift is merely the most tangible
expression—founded also, that is to say, on reciprocity. So in structure
the argument unites with Mauss’s. To this point, at least, Hobbes
understands the suppression of Warre neither through the victory of one
nor by the submission of all, but in a mutual surrender. (The ethical
importance is obvious, and Mauss would duly emphasize it, but
theoretically too the point is in opposition to the cult of power and
organization that was to mark a later evolutionism—and to which Hobbes
went on to contribute.)

On the deeper analogy of reciprocity, one may thus juxtapose to gift
exchange Hobbes’s second law of nature, “That a man be willing, when
others are so too, as farre-forth, as for Peace, and defence of himselfe
he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and
be contented with as much liberty against other men, as he would allow
other men against himselfe”; and the third law, “That men performe their
Covenants made”; and again, the fifth, “That every man strive to
accomodate himselfe to the rest.” But of all these apposite precepts,
the fourth law of nature touches nearest the gift:

The fourth law of nature, gratitude. As Justice dependeth on Antecedent
Covenant; so does GRATITUDE depend on Antecedent Grace, that is to say,
Antecedent Free-gift: and is the fourth Law of Nature; which may be
conceived in this Forme, That a man which receiveth Benefit from another
of meer Grace, Endeavour that he which giveth it, have no reasonable
cause to repent him of his good will. For no man giveth, but with
intention of Good to himselfe; because Gift is Voluntary; and of all
Voluntary Acts, the Object is to every man his own Good; of which if men
see they shall be frustrated, there will be no beginning of benevolence,
or trust; nor consequently of mutuall help; nor of reconciliation of one
man to another; and therefore they are to remain still in the condition
of War; which is contrary to the first and Fundamentall Law of Nature,
which commandeth men to Seek Peace.

(Part I, Chapter 15)

Thus the close correspondance between the two philosophers: including,
if not exactly the gift, at least a similar appreciation of reciprocity
as the primitive mode of peace; and also, if this more marked in Hobbes
than in Mauss, a common respect for the rationality of the undertaking.
Furthermore, the convergence continues with a negative parallel. Neither
Mauss nor Hobbes could trust in the efficacy of reason alone. Both
concede, Hobbes the more explicitly, that reason against the force of an
imprinted rivalry is insufficient to guarantee the contract. Because,
says Hobbes, the laws of nature, even if they be reason itself, are
contrary to our natural passions, and men cannot be expected unfailingly
to obey unless they are generally coerced to do so. On the other hand,
to honor the laws of nature without the assurance that others do
likewise is unreasonable; for then the good become prey, and the strong
arrogant. Men, says Hobbes, are not bees. Men are driven constantly to
compete for honor and dignity, out of which arises hate, envy and
finally, war. And “covenants without the sword, are but words, and of no
strength to secure a man at all.” Hobbes consequently is led to this
paradox: that the laws of nature cannot succeed outside the frame of a
contrived organization, outside the commonwealth. Natural law is
established only by artificial Power, and Reason enfranchised only by
Authority.

I stress again the political character of Hobbes’s argument. The
commonwealth put an end to the state of nature but not to the nature of
man. Men agreed to surrender their right to force (except in
self-defense), and to put all their strength at the disposal of a
sovereign, who would bear their person and save their lives. In this
conception of state formation, Hobbes once more rings very modern. What
more fundamental sense has since been made of the state than that it is
a differentiation of the generalized primitive order: structurally, the
separation of a public authority out of the society at large;
functionally; the special reservation to that authority of coercive
force (monopoly control of force)?

The only way to erect such a Common Power, as may be able to defend them
from the invasion of Forraigners, and the injuries of one another, and
thereby to secure them in such sort, as that by their owne industry, and
by the fruités of the Earth, they may nourish themselves and live
contentedly; is, to conferre all their power and strength upon one Man,
or upon one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills, by
plurality of voices, unto one Will: which is as much as to say, to
appoint one Man, or Assembly of men, to beare their Person; and every
one to owne, and acknowledge himselfe to be the Author of whatsoever
that he that so beareth their Person, shall Act, or cause to be Acted,
in those things which conem the Common Peace and safetie; and therein to
submit their Wills, every one to his Will, and their Judgements, to his
Judgement.

(Part II, Chapter 17)

But Mauss’s resolution of Warre also had historic merit: it corrected
just this simplified progression from chaos to commonwealth, savagery to
civilization, that had been the work of classical contract theory.²⁰
Here in the primitive world Mauss displayed a whole array of
intermediate forms, not only of a certain stability, but that did not
make coercion the price of order. Still, Mauss too was not confident
that reason alone had been responsible. Or perhaps it was just an
afterthought, upon looking back over the peace of the gift, that he saw
in it the signs of an original wisdom. For the rationality of the gift
contradicted everthing he had said before on the subject of hau.
Hobbes’s paradox was to realize the natural (reason) in the artifical;
for Mauss, reason took the form of the irrational. Exchange is the
triumph of reason, but lacking the embodied spirit of the donor (hau),
the gift is not requited.

A few last words about the fate of The Gift. Since Mauss, and in part by
way of rapprochment with modern economics, anthropology has become more
consistently rational in its treatment of exchange. Reciprocity is
contract pure and mainly secular, sanctioned perhaps by a mixture of
considerations of which a carefully calculated self-interest is not the
least (cf. Firth, 1967). Mauss seems in this regard much more like Marx
in the first chapter of Capital: if it can be said without disrespect,
more animistic. One quarter of corn is exchangeable for X hundredweight
iron. What is it in these things, so obviously different, that yet is
equal? Precisely, the question was, for Marx, what in these things
brings them into agreement?—and not what is it about these parties to
the exchange? Similarly, for Mauss; “What force is there in the thing
given that makes the beneficiary reciprocate?” And the same kind of
answer, from “intrinsic” properties: here the hau, if there the socially
necessary labor time. Yet “animistic” is manifestly an improper
characterization of the thought involved. If Mauss, like Marx,
concentrated singularly on the anthropomorphic qualities of the things
exchanged, rather than the (thinglike?) qualities of the people, it was
because each saw in the transactions respectively at issue a determinate
form and epoch of alienation: mystic alienation of the donor in
primitive reciprocity, alienation of human social labor in commodity
production (cf. Godelier, 1966, p. 143). They thus share the supreme
merit, unknown to most “Economic Anthropology,” of taking exchange as it
is historically presented, not as a natural category explicable by a
certain eternal disposition of humanity.

In the total prestations between clan and clan, said Mauss, things are
related in some degree as persons and persons in some degree as things.
More than irrational, it exaggerates only slightly to say that the
process approaches clinical definitions of neurosis: persons are treated
as objects; people confuse themselves with the external world. But even
beyond the desire to affirm the rationality of exchange, a large section
of Anglo-American anthropology has seemed instinctively repelled by the
commercialization of persons apparently implied in the Maussian formula.

Nothing could be farther apart than the initial Anglo-Saxon and French
responses to this generalized idea of prestation. Here was Mauss
decrying the inhumanity of modem abstract distinctions between real and
personal law, calling for a return to the archaic relation between men
and things, while the Anglo-Saxons could only congratulate the ancestors
for having finally liberated men from a debasing confusion with material
objects. And especially for thus liberating women. For when Lévi-Strauss
parleyed the “total prestation” into a grand system of marital
exchanges, an interesting number of British and American ethnologists
recoiled at once from the idea, refusing for their part to “treat women
as commodities.”

Without wanting to decide the issue, not at least in these terms, I do
wonder whether the Anglo-American reaction of distrust was ethnocentric.
It seems to presume an eternal separation of the economic, having to do
with getting and spending, and besides always a little off-color, from
the social sphere of moral relationships. For if it is decided in
advance that the world in general is differentiated as is ours in
particular, economic relations being one thing and social (kinship)
another, then to speak of groups exchanging women does appear an immoral
extension of business to marriage and a slander of all those engaged in
the traffic. Still, the conclusion forgets the great lesson of “total
prestation,” both for the study of primitive economics and of marriage.

The primitive order is generalized. A clear differentiation of spheres
into social and economic does not there appear. As for marriage, it is
not that commercial operations are applied to social relations, but the
two were never completely separated in the first place. We must think
here in the same way we do now about classificatory kinship: not that
the term for “father” is “extended” to father’s brother, phrasing that
smuggles in the priority of the nuclear family, but rather that we are
in the presence of a broad kinship category that knows no such
genealogical distinctions. And as for economics, we are similarly in the
presence of a generalized organization for which the supposition that
kinship is “exogenous” betrays any hope of understanding.

I mention a final positive contribution of The Gift, related to this
point but more specific. At the end of the essay, Mauss in effect
recapitulated his thesis by two Melanesian examples of tenuous relations
between villages and peoples: of how, menaced always by deterioration
into war, primitive groups are nevertheless reconciled by festival and
exchange. This theme too was later amplified by Lévi-Strauss. “There is
a link,” he wrote, “a continuity, between hostile relations and the
provision of reciprocal prestations. Exchanges are peacefully resolved
wars and wars are the result of unsuccessful transactions” (1969, p. 67;
cf. 1943, p. 136). But this implication of The Gift is, I think, even
broader than external relations and transactions. In posing the internal
fragility of the segmentary societies, their constituted decomposition,
The Gift transposes the classic alternatives of war and trade from the
periphery to the very center of social life, and from the occasional
episode to the continuous presence. This is the supreme importance of
Mauss’s return to nature, from which it follows that primitive society
is at war with Warre, and that all their dealings are treaties of peace.
All the exchanges, that is to say, must bear in their material design
some political burden of reconciliation. Or, as the Bushman said, “The
worse thing is not giving presents. If people do not like each other but
one gives a gift and the other must accept, this brings a peace between
them. We give what we have. That is the way we live together” (Marshall,
1961, p. 245).

And from this comes in turn all the basic principles of an economics
properly anthropological, including the one in particular at the heart
of succeeding chapters: that every exchange, as it embodies some
coefficient of sociability, cannot be understood in its material terms
apart from its social terms.



5  ON THE SOCIOLOGY OF PRIMITIVE EXCHANGE


In a discussion that has anthropological pretensions, “provisional
generalization” is no doubt a redundant phrase. Yet the present venture
needs a doubly cautious introduction. Its generalizations have developed
out of a dialogue with ethnographic materials—many of these are appended
Tylorian fashion as “illustrative materials”—but no rigorous tests have
been applied. Perhaps the conclusions may be offered as a plea to
enthnography rather than a contribution to theory, if these are not
again the same thing. At any rate, there follow some suggestions about
the interplay in primitive communities between forms, material
conditions, and social relations of exchange.


Material Flow and Social Relations

What are in the received wisdom “noneconomic” or “exogenous” conditions
are in the primitive reality the very organization of economy.¹ A
material transaction is usually a momentary episode in a continuous
social relation. The social relation exerts governance: the flow of
goods is constrained by, is part of, a status etiquette. “One cannot
treat Nuer economic relations by themselves, for they always form part
of direct social relations of a general kind,” Evans-Pritchard writes:
“. . . there is always between them a general social relationship of one
kind or another, and their economic relations, if such they may be
called, must conform to this general pattern of behavior” (1940, pp.
90–91). The dictum is broadly applicable (cf. White, 1959, pp. 242–245).

Yet the connection between material flow and social relations is
reciprocal. A specific social relation may constrain a given movement of
goods, but a specific transaction—“by the same token”—suggests a
particular social relation. If friends make gifts, gifts make friends. A
great proportion of primitive exchange, much more than our own traffic,
has as its decisive function this latter, instrumental one: the material
flow underwrites or initiates social relations. Thus do primitive
peoples transcend the Hobbesian chaos. For the indicative condition of
primitive society is the absence of a public and sovereign power:
persons and (especially) groups confront each other not merely as
distinct interests but with the possible inclination and certain right
to physically prosecute these interests. Force is decentralized,
legitimately held in severalty, the social compact has yet to be drawn,
the state nonexistent. So peacemaking is not a sporadic intersocietal
event, it is a continuous process going on within society itself. Groups
must “come to terms”—the phrase notably connotes a material exchange
satisfactory on both sides.²

Even on its strictly practical side, exchange in primitive communities
has not the same role as the economic flow in modern industrial
communities. The place of transaction in the total economy is different:
under primitive conditions it is more detached from production, less
firmly hinged to production in an organic way. Typically, it is less
involved than modern exchange in the acquisition of means of production,
more involved with the redistribution of finished goods through the
community. The bias is that of an economy in which food holds a
commanding position, and in which day-to-day output does not depend on a
massive technological complex nor a complex division of labor. It is the
bias also of a domestic mode of production: of household producing
units, division of labor by sex and age dominant, production that looks
to familial requirements, and direct access by domestic groups to
strategic resources. It is the bias of a social order in which rights to
control returns go along with rights to use resources of production, and
in which there is very limited traffic in titles or income privileges in
resources. It is the bias, finally, of societies ordered in the main by
kinship. Such characteristics of primitive economies as these, so
broadly stated, are of course subject to qualification in specific
instances. They are offered only as a guide to the detailed analysis of
distribution that follows. It is also advisable to repeat that
“primitive” shall refer to cultures lacking a political state, and it
applies only insofar as economy and social relations have not been
modified by the historic penetration of states.

On a very general view, the array of economic transactions in the
ethnographic record may be resolved into two types.³ First, those
"vice-versa" movements between two parties known familiarly as
"reciprocity" (A⇄B). The second, centralized movements: collection from
members of a group, often under one hand, and redivision within this
group:

[]

[]

[]

This is “pooling” or “redistribution.” On an even more general view, the
two types merge. For pooling is an organization of reciprocities, a
system of reciprocities—a fact of central bearing upon the genesis of
large-scale redistribution under chiefly aegis. But this most general
understanding merely suggests concentration in the first place on
reciprocity; it remains the course of analytic wisdom to separate the
two.

Their social organizations are very different. True, pooling and
reciprocity may occur in the same social contexts—the same close kinsmen
that pool their resources in household commensality, for instance, also
as individuals share things with one another—but the precise social
relations of pooling and reciprocity are not the same. Pooling is
socially a within relation, the collective action of a group.
Reciprocity is a between relation, the action and reaction of two
parties. Thus pooling is the complement of social unity and, in
Polanyi’s term, “centricity”; whereas, reciprocity is social duality and
“symmetry.” Pooling stipulates a social center where goods meet and
thence flow outwards, and a social boundary too, within which persons
(or subgroups) are cooperatively related. But reciprocity stipulates two
sides, two distinct social-economic interests. Reciprocity can establish
solidary relations, insofar as the material flow suggests assistance or
mutual benefit, yet the social fact of sides is inescapable.

Considering the established contributions of Malinowski and Firth,
Gluckman, Richards, and Polanyi, it does not seem too sanguine to say
that we know fairly well the material and social concomitants of
pooling. Also, what is known fits the argument that pooling is the
material side of “collectivity” and “centricity.” Cooperative food
production, rank and chieftainship, collective political and ceremonial
action, these are some of the ordinary contexts of pooling in primitive
communities. To review very briefly:

The everyday, workaday variety of redistribution is familial pooling of
food. The principle suggested by it is that products of collective
effort in provisioning are pooled, especially should the cooperation
entail division of labor. Stated so, the rule applies not only to
house-holding but to higher-level cooperation as well, to groups larger
than households that develop about some task of procurement—say, buffalo
impounding in the Northern Plains or netting fish in a Polynesian
lagoon. With qualifications—such as the special shares locally accorded
special contributions to the group endeavor—the principle remains at the
higher, as at the lower, household level: “goods collectively procured
are distributed through the collectivity.”

Rights of call on the produce of the underlying population, as well as
obligations of generosity, are everywhere associated with chieftainship.
The organized exercise of these rights and obligations is
redistribution:

I think that throughout the world we would find that the relations
between economics and politics are of the same type. The chief,
everywhere, acts as a tribal banker, collecting food, storing it, and
protecting it, and then using it for the benefit of the whole community.
His functions are the prototype of the public finance system and the
organization of State treasuries of to-day. Deprive the chief of his
privileges and financial benefits and who suffers most but the whole
tribe?

(Malinowski, 1937, pp. 232–233)

This use “for the benefit of the whole community” takes various forms:
subsidizing religious ceremony, social pageantry, or war; underwriting
craft production, trade, the construction of technical apparatus and of
public and religious edifices; redistributing diverse local products;
hospitality and succor of the community (in severalty or in general)
during shortage. Speaking more broadly, redistribution by powers-that-be
serves two purposes, either of which may be dominant in a given
instance. The practical, logistic function—redistribution—sustains the
community, or community effort, in a material sense. At the same time,
or alternatively, it has an instrumental function: as a ritual of
communion and of subordination to central authority, redistribution
sustains the corporate structure itself, that is in a social sense. The
practical benefits may be critical, but, whatever the practical
benefits, chiefly pooling generates the spirit of unity and centricity,
codifies the structure, stipulates the centralized organization of
social order and social action—

. .. every person who takes part in the aηa [feast organized by a
Tikopia chief] is impelled to participate in forms of cooperation which
for the time being go far beyond his personal interests and those of his
family and reach the bounds of the whole community. Such a feast gathers
together chiefs and their clansfolk who at other times are rivals ready
to criticize and slander each other, but who assemble here with an
outward show of amity.. . . In addition, such purposive activity
subserves certain wider social ends, which are common in the sense that
every person or nearly every person knowingly or unknowingly promotes
them. For instance, attendance at the aηa and participation in the
economic contributions does in fact help to support the Tikopia system
of authority.

(Firth, 1950, pp. 230–231)

So we have at least the outline of a functional theory of
redistribution. The central issues are now likely to be developmental
ones, the specification by comparison or phylogenetic study of selective
circumstances. The economic anthropology of reciprocity, however, is not
at the same stage. One reason, perhaps, is a popular tendency to view
reciprocity as balance, as unconditional one-for-one exchange.
Considered as a material transfer, reciprocity is often not that at all.
Indeed, it is precisely through scrutiny of departures from balanced
exchange that one glimpses the interplay between reciprocity, social
relations and material circumstances.

Reciprocity is a whole class of exchanges, a continuum of forms. This is
specially true in the narrow context of material transactions— as
opposed to a broadly conceived social principle or moral norm of
give-and-take. At one end of the spectrum stands the assistance freely
given, the small currency of everyday kinship, friendship, and
neighborly relations, the “pure gift” Malinowski called it, regarding
which an open stipulation of return would be unthinkable and unsociable.
At the other pole, self-interested seizure, appropriation by chicanery
or force requited only by an equal and opposite effort on the principle
of lex talionis, “negative reciprocity” as Gouldner phrases it. The
extremes are notably positive and negative in a moral sense. The
intervals between them are not merely so many gradations of material
balance in exchange, they are intervals of sociability. The distance
between poles of reciprocity is, among other things, social distance:

Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou
shalt not lend usury.

(Deuteronomy xxiii, 21)

Native [Siuai] moralists assert that neighbors should be friendly and
mutually trustful, whereas people from far-off are dangerous and
unworthy of morally just consideration. For example, natives lay great
stress on honesty involving neighbors while holding that trade with
strangers may be guided by caveat emptor.

(Oliver, 1955, p. 82)

Gain at the cost of other communities, particularly communities at a
distance, and more especially such as are felt to be aliens, is not
obnoxious to the standards of homebred use and wont.

(Veblen, 1915, p. 46)

A trader always cheats people. For this reason intra-regional trade is
rather frowned upon while inter-tribal trade gives to the (Kapauku)

A Scheme of Reciprocities

A purely formal typology of reciprocities is possible, one based
exclusively on immediacy of returns, equivalence of returns, and like
material and mechanical dimensions of exchange. The classification thus
in hand, one might proceed to correlate subtypes of reciprocity with
diverse “variables” such as kinship distance of parties to the
transaction. The virtue of this manner of exposition is that it is
“scientific,” or so it would seem. Among the defects is that it is a
conventional metaphor of exposition, not a true history of experiment.
It ought to be recognized from the beginning that the distinction of one
type of reciprocity from another is more than formal. A feature such as
the expectation of returns says something about the spirit of exchange,
about its disinterestedness or its interestedness, the impersonality,
the compassion. Any seeming formal classification conveys these
meanings: it is as much a moral as a mechanical scheme. (That the
recognition of the moral quality prejudges the relation of exchange to
social “variables,” in the sense that the latter are then logically
connected to variations in exchange, is not contested. This is a sign
that the classification is good.)

The actual kinds of reciprocity are many in any primitive society, let
alone in the primitive world taken as a whole. “Vice-versa movements”
may include sharing and counter-sharing of unprocessed food, informal
hospitality, ceremonious affinal exchanges, loaning and repaying,
compensation of specialized or ceremonial services, the transfer that
seals a peace agreement, impersonal haggle, and so on and on. We have
several ethnographic attempts to cope typologically with the empirical
diversity, notably Douglas Oliver’s scheme of Siuai transactions (1955,
pp. 229–231; cf. Price, 1962, p. 37 f; Spencer, 1959, p. 194 f;
Marshall, 1961, and others). In Crime and Custom, Malinowski wrote
rather broadly and unconditionally about reciprocity; in the Argonauts,
however, he developed a classification of Trobriand exchanges out of
manifold variations in balance and equivalence (Malinowski, 1922, pp.
176–194). It was from this vantage point, looking to the directness of
returns, that the continuum which is reciprocity was revealed:

I have on purpose spoken of forms of exchange, of gifts and
counter-gifts, rather than of barter or trade, because, although there
exist forms of barter pure and simple, there are so many transitions and
gradations between that and simple gift, that it is impossible to draw
any fixed line between trade on the one hand, and the exchange of gifts
on the other. . .. In order to deal with these facts correctly it is
necessary to give a complete survey of all forms of payment or present.
In this survey there will be at one end the extreme cases of pure gift,
that is an offering for which nothing is given in return [but see Firth
1957, pp. 221, 222]. Then, through many customary forms of gift or
payment, partially or conditionally returned, which shade into each
other, there come forms of exchange, where more or less strict
equivalence is observed, arriving finally at real barter.

(Malinowski, 1922, p. 176)

Malinowski’s perspective may be taken beyond the Trobriands and applied
broadly to reciprocal exchange in primitive societies. It seems possible
to lay out in abstract fashion a continuum of reciprocities, based on
the “vice-versa” nature of exchanges, along which empirical instances
encountered in the particular ethnographic case can be placed. The
stipulation of material returns, less elegantly, the “sidedness” of
exchange, would be the critical thing. For this there are obvious
objective criteria, such as the toleration of material unbalance and the
leeway of delay: the initial movement of goods from hand to hand is more
or less requited materially and there are variations too in the time
allowed for reciprocation (again see Firth, 1957, pp. 220–221). Put
another way, the spirit of exchange swings from disinterested concern
for the other party through mutuality to self-interest. So expressed,
the assessment of “sidedness” can be supplemented by empirical criteria
in addition to those of immediacy and material equivalence: the initial
transfer may be voluntary, involuntary, prescribed, contracted; the
return freely bestowed, exacted, or dunned; the exchange haggled or not,
the subject of accounting or not; and so forth.

The spectrum of reciprocities proposed for general use is defined by its
extremes and mid-point:

Generalized reciprocity, the solidary extreme (A[]B)⁴

“Generalized reciprocity” refers to transactions that are putatively
altruistic, transactions on the line of assistance given and, if
possible and necessary, assistance returned. The ideal type is
Malinowski’s “pure gift.” Other indicative ethnographic formulas are
“sharing,” “hospitality,” “free gift,” “help,” and “generosity.” Less
sociable, but tending toward the same pole are “kinship dues,” “chiefly
dues,” and “noblesse oblige.” Price (1962) refers to the genre as “weak
reciprocity” by reason of the vagueness of the obligation to
reciprocate.

At the extreme, say voluntary food-sharing among near kinsmen— or for
its logical value, one might think of the suckling of children in this
context—the expectation of a direct material return is unseemly. At best
it is implicit. The material side of the transaction is repressed by the
social: reckoning of debts outstanding cannot be overt and is typically
left out of account. This is not to say that handing over things in such
form, even to “loved ones,” generates no counter-obligation. But the
counter is not stipulated by time, quantity, or quality: the expectation
of reciprocity is indefinite. It usually works out that the time and
worth of reciprocation are not alone conditional on what was given by
the donor, but also upon what he will need and when, and likewise what
the recipient can afford and when. Receiving goods lays on a diffuse
obligation to reciprocate when necessary to the donor and/or possible
for the recipient. The requital thus may be very soon, but then again it
may be never. There are people who even in the fullness of time are
incapable of helping themselves or others. A good pragmatic indication
of generalized reciprocity is a sustained one-way flow. Failure to
reciprocate does not cause the giver of stuff to stop giving: the goods
move one way, in favor of the have-not, for a very long period.

Balanced reciprocity, the midpoint (A[]B)

“Balanced reciprocity” refers to direct exchange. In precise balance,
the reciprocation is the customary equivalent of the thing received and
is without delay. Perfectly balanced reciprocity, the simultaneous
exchange of the same types of goods to the same amounts, is not only
conceivable but ethnographically attested in certain marital
transactions (e.g., Reay, 1959, pp. 95 f), friendship compacts
(Seligman, 1910, p. 70), and peace agreements (Hogbin, 1939, p. 79;
Loeb, 1926, p. 204; Williamson, 1912, p. 183). “Balanced reciprocity”
may be more loosely applied to transactions which stipulate returns of
commensurate worth or utility within a finite and narrow period. Much
“gift-exchange,” many “pay-ments,” much that goes under the ethnographic
head of “trade” and plenty that is called “buying-selling” and involves
“primitive money” belong in the genre of balanced reciprocity.

Balanced reciprocity is less “personal” than generalized reciprocity.
From our own vantage-point it is “more economic.” The parties confront
each other as distinct economic and social interests. The material side
of the transaction is at least as critical as the social: there is more
or less precise reckoning, as the things given must be covered within
some short term. So the pragmatic test of balanced reciprocity becomes
an inability to tolerate one-way flows; the relations between people are
disrupted by a failure to reciprocate within limited time and
equivalence leeways. It is notable of the main run of generalized
reciprocities that the material flow is sustained by prevailing social
relations; whereas, for the main run of balanced exchange, social
relations hinge on the material flow.

Negative reciprocity, the unsociable extreme (A[]B)

“Negative reciprocity” is the attempt to get something for nothing with
impunity, the several forms of appropriation, transactions opened and
conducted toward net utilitarian advantage. Indicative ethnographic
terms include “haggling” or “barter,” “gambling,” “chi-canery,” “theft,”
and other varieties of seizure.

Negative reciprocity is the most impersonal sort of exchange. In guises
such as “barter” it is from our own point of view the “most economic.”
The participants confront each other as opposed interests, each looking
to maximize utility at the other’s expense. Approaching the transaction
with an eye singular to the main chance, the aim of the opening party,
or of both parties, is the unearned increment. One of the most sociable
forms, leaning toward balance, is haggling conducted in the spirit of
“what the traffic will bear.” From this, negative reciprocity ranges
through various degrees of cunning, guile, stealth, and violence to the
finesse of a well-conducted horse raid. The “reciprocity” is, of course,
conditional again, a matter of defense of self-interest. So the flow may
be one-way once more, reciprocation contingent upon mustering
countervailing pressure or guile.

It is a long way from a suckling child to a Plains Indians’ horse-raid.
Too long, it could be argued, the classification too widely set. Yet
“vice-versa movements” in the ethnographic record do grade into each
other along the whole span. It is well to recall, nevertheless, that
empirical exchanges often fall somewhere along the line, not directly on
the extreme and middle points here outlined. The question is, can one
specify social or economic circumstances that impel reciprocity toward
one or another of the stipulated positions, toward generalized,
balanced, or negative reciprocity? I think so.


Reciprocity and Kinship Distance

The span of social distance between those who exchange conditions the
mode of exchange. Kinship distance, as has already been suggested, is
especially relevant to the form of reciprocity. Reciprocity is inclined
toward the generalized pole by close kinship, toward the negative
extreme in proportion to kinship distance.

The reasoning is nearly syllogistic. The several reciprocities from
freely bestowed gift to chicanery amount to a spectrum of sociability,
from sacrifice in favor of another to self-interested gain at the
expense of another. Take as the minor premise Tylor’s dictum that
kindred goes with kindness, “two words whose common derivation expresses
in the happiest way one of the main principles of social life.” It
follows that close kin tend to share, to enter into generalized
exchanges, and distant and nonkin to deal in equivalents or in guile.
Equivalence becomes compulsory in proportion to kinship distance lest
relations break off entirely, for with distance there can be little
tolerance of gain and loss even as there is little inclination to extend
oneself. To nonkin—“other people”, perhaps not even “people”—no quarter
must needs be given: the manifest inclination may well be “devil take
the hindmost.”

All this seems perfectly applicable to our own society, but it is more
significant in primitive society. Because kinship is more significant in
primitive society. It is, for one thing, the organizing principle or
idiom of most groups and most social relations. Even the category
“nonkin” is ordinarily defined by it, that is, as the negative aspect of
it, the logical extreme of the class—nonbeing as a state of being. There
is something real to this view; it is not logical sophistry. Among
ourselves, “nonkin” denotes specialized status relations of positive
quality: doctor-patient, policeman-citizen, employer-employee,
classmates, neighbors, professional colleagues. But for them,“nonkin”
connotes the negation of community (or tribalism); often it is the
synonym for “enemy” or “stranger.” Likewise the economic relation tends
to be a simple negation of kinship reciprocities: other institutional
norms need not come into play.

Kinship distance, however, has different aspects. It may be organized in
several ways, and what is “close” in one of these ways need not be so in
another. Exchange may be contingent on genealogical distance (as locally
imputed), that is, on interpersonal kinship status. Or it may hinge on
segmentary distance, on descent group status. (One suspects that where
these two do not correspond the closer relation governs the reciprocity
appropriate in dealings between individual parties, but this ought to be
worked out empirically.) For the purpose of creating a general model,
attention should also be given to the power of community in stipulating
distance. It is not only that kinship organizes communities, but
communities kinship, so that a spatial, coresidential term affects the
measure of kinship distance and thus the mode of exchange.

Brothers living together, or a paternal uncle and his nephews living in
the same house were, as far as my observation goes, on much closer terms
with each other than relatives of similar degrees living apart. This was
evident whenever there was a question of borrowing things, of getting
help, of accepting an obligation, or of assuming responsibilities for
each other.

(Malinowski, 1915, p. 532; the reference is to the Mailu)

Mankind [to Siuai] consists of relatives and strangers. Relatives are
usually interlinked by both blood and marital ties; most of them live
nearby, and persons who live nearby are all relatives . . . Transactions
among them should be carried out in a spirit devoid of commerciality—
preferably consisting of sharing [i.e., “pooling” in terms of the
present discussion], nonreciprocable giving, and bequeathing, among
closest relatives, or of lending among more distantly related ones. . .
. Except for a few very distantly related sib-mates, persons who live
far away are not relatives and can only be enemies. Most of their
customs are unsuitable for the Siuai, but a few of their goods and
techniques are desirable. One interacts with them only to buy and
sell—utilizing hard bargaining and deceit to make as much profit from
such transactions as possible (Oliver, 1955, pp. 454–455).

Here is one possible model for analyzing reciprocity: the tribal plan
can be viewed as a series of more and more inclusive kinship-residential
sectors, and reciprocity seen then to vary in character by sectoral
position. The close kinsmen who render assistance are particularly near
kinsmen in a spatial sense: it is in regard to people of the household,
the camp, hamlet, or village that compassion is required, inasmuch as
interaction is intense and peaceable solidarity essential. But the
quality of mercy is strained in peripheral sectors, strained by kinship
distance, so is less likely in exchanges with fellow tribesmen of
another village than among covillagers, and still less likely in the
intertribal sector.

Kinship-residential groupings from this perspective comprise
ever-widening co-membership spheres: the household, the local lineage,
perhaps the village, the subtribe, tribe, other tribes—the particular
plan of course varies. The structure is a hierarchy of levels of
integration, but from the inside and on the ground it is a series of
concentric circles. Social relations of each circle have a specific
quality— household relations, lineage relations, and so on—and except as
the sectoral divisions be cut through by other organizations of kinship
solidarity—say, nonlocalized clans or personal kindreds—relations within
each sphere are more solidary than relations of the next, more inclusive
sector. Reciprocity accordingly inclines toward balance and chicane in
proportion to sectoral distance. In each sector, certain modes of
reciprocity are characteristic or dominant: generalized modes are
dominant in the narrowest spheres and play out in wider spheres,
balanced reciprocity is characteristic of intermediate sectors, chicane
of the most peripheral spheres. In brief, a general model of the play of
reciprocity may be developed by superimposing the society’s sectoral
plan upon the reciprocity continuum. Such a model is shown in Figure
5.1.

The plan does not rest alone upon the two terms of sectoral division and
reciprocity variation. Something is to be said for the embedded third
term, morality. “Far more than we ordinarily suppose,” Firth has
written, “economic relations rest on moral foundations” (1951, p. 144).
Certainly that must be the way the people see it—“Although the Siuai
have separate terms for ‘generosity,’ ‘cooperativeness,’ ‘moral-ity’
(that is, rule abiding), and ‘geniality,’ I believe that they consider
all these to be closely interrelated aspects of the same attribute of
goodness . . .” (Oliver, 1955, p. 78). Another contrast with ourselves
is suggested, a tendency for morality, like reciprocity, to be
sectorally organized in primitive societies. The norms are
characteristically relative and situational rather than absolute and
universal. A given act, that is to say, is not so much in itself good or
bad, it depends on who the “Alter” is. The appropriation of another
man’s goods or his woman, which is a sin (“theft,” “adultery”) in the
bosom of one’s community, may be not merely condoned but positively
rewarded with the admiration of one’s fellows—if it is perpetrated on an
outsider. The contrast with the absolute standards of the
Judeo-Christian tradition is probably overdrawn: no moral system is
exclusively absolute (especially in wartime) and none perhaps is
entirely relative and contextual. But situational standards, defined
often in sectoral terms, do seem to prevail in primitive communities and
this contrasts sufficiently with our own to have drawn repeated comment
from ethnologists. For instance:

[Figure 5.1 Reciprocity and Kinship Residential Sectors]

Figure 5.1 Reciprocity and Kinship Residential Sectors

Navaho morality is . .. contextual rather than absolute.. . . Lying is
not always and everywhere wrong. The rules vary with the situation. To
deceive when trading with foreign tribes is a morally accepted practice.
Acts are not in themselves bad or good. Incest [by its nature, a
contextual sin] is perhaps the only conduct that is condemned without
qualification. It is quite correct to use witchcraft techniques in
trading with members of foreign tribes.. . . There is an almost complete
absence of abstract ideals. Under the circumstances of aboriginal life
Navahos did not need to orient themselves in terms of abstract morality.
. .. In a large, complex society like modern America, where people come
and go and business and other dealings must be carried on by people who
never see each other, it is functionally necessary to have abstract
standards that transcend an immediate concrete situation in which two or
more persons are interacting.

(Kluckhohn, 1959, p. 434)

The scheme with which we deal is at least tripartite: social, moral, and
economic. Reciprocity and morality are sectorally structured—the
structure is that of kinship-tribal groupings.

But the scheme is entirely a hypothetical state of affairs. One can
conceive circumstances that would alter the social-moral-reciprocal
relations postulated by it. Propositions about the external sectors are
particularly vulnerable. (For “external sector” one can generally read
“intertribal sector,” the ethnic peripherae of primitive communities; in
practice it can be set where positive morality fades out or where
intergroup hostility is the normal in-group expectation.) Transactions
in this sphere may be consummated by force and guile, it is true, by
wabuwabu, to use the near-onomatopoeic Dobuan term for sharp practice.
Yet it seems that violent appropriation is a resort born of urgent
requirements that can only, or most easily, be supplied by militant
tactics. Peaceful symbiosis is at least a common alternative.

In these nonviolent confrontations the propensity to wabuwabu no doubt
persists; it is built in to the sectoral plan. So if it can be socially
tolerated—if, that is, countervailing peace-enforcing conditions are
sufficiently strong—hard bargaining is the institutionalized external
relation. We find then gimwali, the mentality of the market place, the
impersonal (no-partnership) exchange of Trobriand commoners of different
villages or of Trobrianders and other peoples. But still gimwali does
suppose special conditions, some sort of social insulation that prevents
the economic friction from kindling a dangerous conflagration. In the
ordinary case, haggling is actually repressed, particularly, it appears,
if the exchange of the border is critical to both sides, as where
different strategic specialties move against each other. Despite the
sectoral distance, the exchange is equitable, utu, balanced: the free
play of wabuwabu and gimwali is checked in the interest of the
symbiosis.

The check is delivered by special and delicate institutional means of
border exchange. The means sometimes look so preposterous as to be
considered by ethnologists some sort of “game” the natives play, but
their design manifestly immunizes an important economic interdependence
against a fundamental social cleavage. (Compare the discussion of the
kula in White, 1959, and Fortune,1932.) Silent trade is a famous case in
point—good relations are maintained by preventing any relations. Most
common are “trade-partnerships” and “trade-friendships.” The important
thing in all varieties is a social suppression of negative reciprocity.
Peace is built in, haggling outlawed, and, conducted as a transfer of
equivalent utilities, the exchange in turn underwrites the peace.
(Trade-partnerships, often developed along lines of classificatory or
affinal kinship, particularly incapsulate external economic transactions
in solidary social relations. Status relations essentially internal are
projected across community and tribal boundaries. The reciprocity then
may lean over backward, in the direction not of wabuwabu but something
to the generalized side. Phrased as gift-giving, the presentation admits
of delay in reciprocation: a direct return may indeed be unseemly.
Hospitality, on another occasion returned in kind, accompanies the
formal exchange of trade goods. For a host to give stuff over and above
the worth of things brought by his partner is not unusual: it both
befits the relation so to treat one’s partner while he is traveling and
stores up credits. On a wider view, this measure of unbalance sustains
the trade partnership, compelling as it does another meeting.)

Intertribal symbiosis, in short, alters the terms of the hypothetical
model. The peripheral sector is breached by more sociable relations than
are normal in this zone. The context of exchange is now a narrower
co-membership sphere, the exchange is peaceful and equitable.
Reciprocity falls near the balance point.

Now the assertions of this essay, as I have said, developed out of a
dialogue with ethnographic materials. It seems worthwhile to append some
of these data to appropriate sections of the argument. Accordingly,
Appendix A sets out materials relevant to the present section,
“Reciprocity and Kinship Distance.” This is not by way of proof, of
course—there are indeed certain exceptions, or seeming exceptions, in
the materials— but by way of exposition or illustration. Moreover, since
the ideas only gradually came over me and the monographs and articles
had been in many instances consulted for other purposes, it is certain
that data pertinent to reciprocity in the works cited have escaped me.
(I hope this is sufficiently apologetic and that the ethnographic notes
of Appendix A are of interest to someone besides myself.)

Whatever the value of these notes as exposition of the asserted relation
between reciprocity and kinship distance, they must also suggest to the
reader certain limitations of the present perspective. Simply to
demonstrate that the character of reciprocity is contingent upon social
distance—even if it could be demonstrated in an incontestable way—is not
to traffic in ultimate explanation, nor yet to specify when exchanges
will in fact take place. A systematic relation between reciprocity and
sociability in itself does not say when, or even to what extent, the
relation will come into play. The supposition here is that the forces of
constraint lie outside the relation itself. The terms of final analysis
are the larger cultural structure and its adaptive response to its
milieu. From this wider view one may be able to stipulate the
significant sectoral lines and kinship categories of the given case, and
to stipulate too the incidence of reciprocity in different sectors.
Supposing it true that close kinsmen would share food, for example, it
need not follow that the transactions occur. The total
(cultural-adaptive) context may render intensive sharing dysfunctional
and predicate in subtle ways the demise of a society that allows itself
the luxury. Permit me to quote in extenso a passage from Fredrik Barth’s
brilliant ecological study of South Persian nomads. It shows so well the
larger considerations that must be brought to the bar of explanation; in
detail it exemplifies a situation that discounts intensive sharing:

The stability of a pastoral population depends on the maintenance of a
balance between pastures, animal population, and human population. The
pastures available by their techniques of herding set a maximal limit to
the total animal population that an area will support; while the
patterns of nomadic production and consumption define a minimal limit to
the size of the herd that will support a human household. In this double
set of balances is summarized the special difficulty in establishing a
population balance in a pastoral economy: the human population must be
sensitive to imbalances between flocks and pastures. Among agricultural,
or hunting and collecting people, a crude Malthusian type of population
control is sufficient. With a growing population, starvation and
death-rate rise, until a balance is reached around which the population
stabilizes. Where pastoral nomadism is the predominant or exclusive
pattern, the nomad population, if subjected to such a form of population
control, would not establish a population balance, but would find its
whole basis for subsistence removed. Quite simply, this is because the
productive capital on which their subsistence is based is not simply
land, it is animals—in other words food. A pastoral economy can only be
maintained so long as there are no pressures on its practitioners to
invade this large store of food. A pastoral population can therefore
only reach a stable level if other effective population controls
intervene before those of starvation and death-rate. A first requirement
in such an adaptation is the presence of the patterns of private
ownership of herds, and individual economic responsibility for each
household. By these patterns, the population becomes fragmented with
respect to economic activities, and economic factors can strike
differentially, eliminating some members of the population [i.e.,
through sedentarization] without affecting other members of the same
population. This would be impossible if the corporate organization with
respect to political life, and pasture rights, were also made relevant
to economic responsibility and survival.

(Barth, 1961, p. 124)

Now, about the incidence of reciprocity in the specific case, here is
something else to consider—the people may be stingy. Nothing has been
said about sanctions of exchange relations nor, more importantly, about
forces that countervail. There are contradictions in primitive
economies: inclinations of self-interest are unleashed that are
incompatible with the high levels of sociability customarily demanded.
Malinowski long ago noticed this and Firth (1926) in an early paper on
Maori proverbs skillfully brought to light the clash, the subtle
interplay, between the moral dictates of sharing and narrow economic
interests. The widespread mode of family production for use, it might be
remarked, acts to brake outputs at comparatively low levels even as it
orients economic concern inward, within the household. The mode of
production thus does not readily lend itself to general economic
solidarity. Suppose sharing is morally called for, say by the
destitution of a near kinsman, all the things that make sharing good and
proper may not evoke in an affluent man the inclination to do it. And
even as there may be little to gain by assisting others, there are no
iron-clad guarantees of such social compacts as kinship. The received
social-moral obligations prescribe an economic course, and the publicity
of primitive life, increasing the risk of evoking jealousy, hostility,
and future economic penalty, tends to keep people on course. But, as is
well known, to observe that a society has a system of morality and
constraints is not to say that everyone acquiesces in it. There may be
biša-baša times, “particularly in the late winter, when the household
would hide its food, even from relatives” (Price, 1962, p. 47).

That biša-baša is the pervasive condition of some peoples is not
embarassing to the present thesis. The Siriono, everyone knows, parley
hostility and crypto-stinginess into a way of life. Interestingly
enough, the Siriono articulate ordinary norms of primitive economic
intercourse. By the norm, for instance, the hunter should not eat the
animal he has killed. But the de facto sector of sharing is not merely
very narrow, “sharing rarely occurs without a certain amount of mutual
mistrust and misunderstanding; a person always feels that it is he who
is being taken advantage of,” so that “The bigger the catch the more
sullen the hunter” (Holmberg,1950, pp. 60, 62; cf. pp. 36, 38–39). The
Siriono are not thereby different in kind from the run of primitive
communities. They simply realize to an extreme the potentiality
elsewhere less often consummated, the possibility that structural
compulsions of generosity are unequal to a test of hardship. But then,
the Siriono are a band of displaced and deculturated persons. The whole
cultural shell, from rules of sharing through institutions of
chieftainship and Crow kinship terminology, is a mockery of their
present miserable state.


Reciprocity and Kinship Rank

It is by now apparent—it is made apparent by the illustrative materials
of Appendix A—that in any actual exchange several circumstances may
simultaneously bear upon the material flow. Kinship distance, while
perhaps significant, is not necessarily decisive. Something may be said
for rank, relative wealth and need, the type of goods whether food or
durables, and still other “factors.” As a tactic of presentation and
interpretation, it is useful to isolate and separately consider these
factors. Accordingly, we move on to the relation between reciprocity and
kinship rank, but with this proviso: propositions about the covariation
of kinship distance or of kinship rank and reciprocity can be argued
separately, even validated separately to the extent to which it is
possible to select instances in which only the factor at issue is in
play—holding “other things constant”—but the propositions do not present
themselves separately in fact. The obvious course of further research is
to work out the power of the several “variables” during combined plays.
At best only the beginnings of this course are suggested here.

Rank difference as much as kinship distance supposes an economic
relation. The vertical, rank axis of exchange—or the implication of
rank—may affect the form of the transaction, just as the horizontal
kinship-distance axis affects it. Rank is to some extent privilege,
droit du seigneur, and it has its responsibilities, noblesse oblige. The
dues and duties fall to both sides, both high and low have their claims,
and feudal terms indeed do not convey the economic equity of kinship
ranking. In its true historic setting noblesse oblige hardly cancelled
out the droits du seigneur. In primitive society social inequality is
more the organization of economic equality. Often, in fact, high rank is
only secured or sustained by o’ercrowing generosity: the material
advantage is on the subordinate’s side. Perhaps it is too much to see
the relation of parent and child as the elemental form of kinship
ranking and its economic ethic. It is true, nevertheless, that
paternalism is a common metaphor of primitive chieftainship.
Chieftainship is ordinarily a relation of higher descent. So it is
singularly appropriate that the chief is their “father,” they his
“children,” and economic dealings between them cannot help but be
affected.

The economic claims of rank and subordination are interdependent. The
exercise of chiefly demand opens the way to solicitation from below, and
vice versa—not uncommonly a moderate exposure to the “larger world” is
enough to evoke native reference to customary chiefly dues as local
banking procedure (cf. Ivens, 1927, p. 32). The word then for the
economic relation between kinship ranks is “reciprocity.” The
reciprocity, moreover, is fairly classed as “generalized.” While not as
sociable as the run of assistance among close kinsmen, it does lean
toward that side of the reciprocity continuum. Goods are in truth
yielded to powers-that-be, perhaps on call and demand, and likewise
goods may have to be humbly solicited from them. Still the rationale is
often assistance and need, and the supposition of returns
correspondingly indefinite. Reciprocation may be left until a need
precipitates it, it bears no necessary equivalence to the initial gift,
and the material flow can be unbalanced in favor of one side or the
other for a long time.

Reciprocity is harnessed to various principles of kinship rank.
Generation-ranking, with the elders the privileged parties, may be of
significance among hunters and gatherers not merely in the life of the
family but in the life of the camp as a whole, and generalized
reciprocity between juniors and seniors a correspondingly broad rule of
social exchange (cf. Radcliffe-Brown,1948, pp. 42–43). The Tro-brianders
have a name for the economic ethic appropriate between parties of
different rank within common descent groups—pokala. It is the rule that
“Junior members of a sub-clan are expected to render gifts and services
to their seniors, who in return are expected to confer assistance and
material benefits on the juniors” (Powell,1960, p. 126). Even where rank
is tied to genealogical seniority and consummated in office
power—chieftainship properly so called—the ethic is the same. Take
Polynesian chiefs, officeholders in large, segmented polities: supported
on the one hand by various chiefly dues, they are freighted, as many
have observed, with perhaps even greater obligations to the underlying
population. Probably always the “economic basis” of primitive politics
is chiefly generosity—at one stroke an act of positive morality and a
laying of indebtedness upon the commonalty. Or, to take a larger view,
the entire political order is sustained by a pivotal flow of goods, up
and down the social hierarchy, with each gift not merely connoting a
status relation but, as a generalized gift not directly requited,
compelling a loyalty.

In communities with established rank orders, generalized reciprocity is
enforced by the received structure, and once in operation the exchange
has redundant effects on the rank system. There is a large range of
societies, however, in which rank and leadership are in the main
achieved; here reciprocity is more or less engaged in the formation of
rank itself, as a “starting mechanism.” The connection between
reciprocity and rank is brought to bear in the first case in the form,
“to be noble is to be generous,” in the second case, “to be generous is
to be noble.” The prevailing rank structure influences economic
relations in the former instance; the reciprocity influences
hierarchical relations in the latter. (An analogous feedback occurs in
the context of kinship distance. Hospitality is frequently employed to
suggest socia-bility—this is discussed later. John Tanner, one of those
“feral Whites” who grew to manhood among the Indians, relates an
anecdote even more to the point: recalling that his Ojibway family was
once saved from starvation by a Muskogean family, he noted that if any
of his own people ever afterwards met any of the latter, “he would call
him ‘brother,’ and treat him as such” [Tanner, 1956, p. 24].)

The term “starting mechanism” is Gouldner’s. He explains in this way how
reciprocity may be considered a starting mechanism:

. .. it helps to initiate social interaction and is functional in the
early phases of certain groups before they have developed a
differentiated and customary set of status duties.. . . Granted that the
question of origins can readily bog down in a metaphysical morass, the
fact is that many concrete social systems [perhaps “relations and
groups” is more apt] do have determinate beginnings. Marriages are not
made in heaven.. . . Similarly, corporations, political parties, and all
manner of groups have their beginnings.. . . People are continually
brought together in new juxtapositions and combinations, bringing with
them the possibilities of new social systems. How are these
possibilities realized? . .. Although this perspective may at first seem
somewhat alien to the functionalist, once it is put to him, he may
suspect that certain kinds of mechanisms, conducive to the
crystallization of social systems out of ephemeral contacts, will in
some measure be institutionalized or otherwise patterned in any society.
At this point he would be considering “starting mechanisms.” In this
way, I suggest, the norm of reciprocity provides one among many starting
mechanisms.

(Gouldner, 1960, pp. 176–177)

Economic imbalance is the key to deployment of generosity, of
generalized reciprocity, as a starting mechanism of rank and leadership.
A gift that is not yet requited in the first place “creates a something
between people”: it engenders continuity in the relation, solidarity—at
least until the obligation to reciprocate is discharged. Secondly,
falling under “the shadow of indebtedness,” the recipient is constrained
in his relations to the giver of things. The one who has benefited is
held in a peaceful, circumspect, and responsive position in relation to
his benefactor. The “norm of reciprocity,” Gouldner remarks, “makes two
interrelated minimal demands: (1) people should help those who have
helped them, and (2) people should not injure those who have helped
them” (1960, p. 171). These demands are as compelling in the highlands
of New Guinea as in the prairies of Peoria—“Gifts [among Gahuka-Gama]
have to be repaid. They constitute a debt, and until discharged the
relationship of the individuals involved is in a state of imbalance. The
debtor has to act circumspectly towards those who have this advantage
over him or otherwise risk ridicule” (Read, 1959, p. 429). The esteem
that accrues to the generous man all to one side, generosity is usefully
enlisted as a starting mechanism of leadership because it creates
followership. “Wealth in this finds him friends,” Denig writes of the
aspiring Assiniboin, “as it does on other occasions everywhere” (Denig,
1928–29, p. 525).

Apart from highly organized chiefdoms and simple hunters and gatherers,
there are many intermediate tribal peoples among whom pivotal local
leaders come to prominence without yet becoming holders of office and
title, of ascribed privilege and of sway over corporate political
groups. They are men who “build a name” as it is said, “big-men” they
may be reckoned, or “men of importance,” “bulls,” who rise above the
common herd, who gather followers and thus achieve authority. The
Melanesian “big-man” is a case in point. So too the Plains Indian
“chief.” The process of gathering a personal following and that of
ascent to the summits of renown is marked by calculated generosity—if
not true compassion. Generalized reciprocity is more or less enlisted as
a starting mechanism.

In diverse ways, then, generalized reciprocity is engaged with the rank
order of the community. Yet we have already characterized the economics
of chieftainship in other transactional terms, as redistribution (or
large-scale pooling). At this juncture the evolutionist question is
posed: “When does one give way then to the other, reciprocity to
redistribution?” This question, however, may mislead. Chiefly
redistribution is not different in principle from kinship-rank
reciprocity. It is, rather, based upon the reciprocity principle, a
highly organized form of that principle. Chiefly redistribution is a
centralized, formal organization of kinship-rank reciprocities, an
extensive social integration of the dues and obligations of leadership.
The real ethnographic world does not present us with the abrupt
“appearance” of redistribution. It presents approximations and kinds of
centricity. The apparent course of wisdom is to hinge our
characterizations—of rank reciprocities versus a system of
redistribution—on formal differences in the centralization process, and
in this way to resolve the evolutionist issue.

A big-man system of reciprocities may be quite centralized and a chiefly
system quite decentralized. A thin line separates them, but it is
perhaps significant. Between centricity in a Melanesian big-man economy
such as Siuai (Oliver, 1955) and centricity in a Northwest Coast
chiefdom such as the Nootka (Drucker, 1951) there is little to choose. A
leader in each case integrates the economic activity of a (more or less)
localized following: he acts as a shunting station for goods flowing
reciprocally between his own and other like groups of society. The
economic relation to followers is also the same: the leader is the
central recipient and bestower of favors. The thin line of difference is
this: the Nootka leader is an officeholder in a lineage (house group),
his following is this corporate group, and his central economic position
is ascribed by right of chiefly due and chiefly obligation. So
centricity is built into the structure. In Siuai, it is a personal
achievement. The following is an achievement—a result of generosity
bestowed— the leadership an achievement, and the whole structure will as
such dissolve with the demise of the pivotal big-man. Now I think that
most of us concerned with “redistributive economies” have come to
include Northwest Coast peoples under this head; whereas assigning Siuai
that status would at least provoke disagreement. This suggests that the
political organization of reciprocities is implicitly recognized as a
decisive step. Where kinship-rank reciprocity is laid down by office and
political grouping, and becomes sui generis by virtue of customary duty,
it takes on a distinctive character. The distinctive character may be
usefully named—chiefly redistribution.

A further difference in economies of chiefly redistribution is worth
remarking. It is another difference in centricity. The flow of goods
both into and out of the hands of powers-that-be is for the most part
unintegrated in certain ethnographic instances. Subordinates in
severalty and on various occasions render stuff to the chief, and often
in severalty receive benefits from him. While there is always some
massive accumulation and large-scale handout—say during rites of
chieftainship—the prevailing flow between chief and people is fragmented
into independent and small transactions: a gift to the chief from here,
some help given out there. So aside from the special occasion, the chief
is continuously turning over petty stocks. This is the ordinary
situation in the smaller Pacific island chiefdoms—e.g., Moala (Sahlins,
1962), apparently Tikopia—and it may be generally true of pastoralist
chiefdoms. On the other hand, chiefs may glory in massive accumulations
and more or less massive dispensations, and at times too in large stores
on hand congealed by pressure on the commonalty. Here the independent
act of homage or noblesse oblige is of less significance. And if, in
addition, the social scale of chiefly redistribution is extensive—the
polity large, dispersed, and segmented—one confronts a measure of
centricity approximating the classical magazine economies of antiquity.

Appendix B presents illustrative ethnographic materials on the relation
between rank and reciprocity. (See the citation from Malo under B.4.2
and from Bartram under B.5.2 on magazine economies of various scale.)


Reciprocity and Wealth

According to their [the Yukaghir] way of thinking, “a man who possesses
provisions must share them with those who do not possess them”
(Jochelson, 1926, p. 43).

This habit of share and share alike is easily understandable in a
community where everyone is likely to find himself in difficulties from
time to time, for it is scarcity and not sufficiency that makes people
generous, since everybody is thereby ensured against hunger. He who is
in need to-day receives help from him who may be in like need tomorrow.

(Evans-Pritchard, 1940, p. 85)

One of the senses of previous remarks on rank and reciprocity is that
rank distinctions, or attempts to promote them, tend to extend
generalized exchange beyond the customary range of sharing. The same
upshot may come of wealth differences between parties, often anyhow
associated with rank differences.

If one is poor and one’s comrade is rich, well, there are certain
constraints on acquisitiveness in our dealings—at least if we are to
remain comrades, or even acquaintances, for very long. There are
particularly restraints on the wealthier, if not a certain richesse
oblige.

That is to say, given some social bond between those who exchange,
differences in fortune between them compel a more altruistic
(generalized) transaction than is otherwise appropriate. A difference in
affluence— or in capacity to replenish wealth—would lower the
sociability content of balanced dealing. As far as the exchange
balances, the side that cannot afford it has sacrificed in favor of the
side that did not need it. The greater the wealth gap, therefore, the
greater the demonstrable assistance from rich to poor that is necessary
just to maintain a given degree of sociability. Reasoning further on the
same line, the inclination toward generalized exchange deepens where the
economic gap amounts to oversupply and undersupply of customary
requirements and, especially, of urgent stuff. The thing to look for is
food-sharing between haves and have-nots. It is one thing to demand
returns on woodpecker scalps, yet one spares a dime—brother!—for even a
hungry stranger.

The “brother” is important. That scarcity and not sufficiency makes
people generous is understandable, functional, “where everyone is likely
to find himself in difficulties from time to time.” It is most
understandable, however, and most likely, where kinship community and
kinship morality prevail. That whole economies are organized by the
combined play of scarcity and differential accumulation is no secret to
Economic Science. But then the societies involved do not wrest a
livelihood as limited and uncertain as the Nuer’s, nor do they meet
hardship as kinship communities. It is such circumstances precisely that
make invidious accumulation of fortune intolerable and dysfunctional.
And if the affluent do not play the game, they ordinarily can be forced
to disgorge, in one way or another:

A Bushman will go to any lengths to avoid making other Bushmen jealous
of him, and for this reason the few possessions the Bushmen have are
constantly circling among members of their groups. No one cares to keep
a particularly good knife too long, even though he may want it
desperately, because he will become the object of envy; as he sits by
himself polishing a fine edge on the blade he will hear the soft voices
of the other men in his band saying: “Look at him there, admiring his
knife while we have nothing.” Soon somebody will ask him for his knife,
for everybody would like to have it, and he will give it away. Their
culture insists that they share with each other, and it has never
happened that a Bushman failed to share objects, food, or water with
other members of his band, for without very rigid co-operation Bushmen
could not survive the famines and droughts that the Kalahari offers
them.

(Thomas, 1959, p. 22)

Should the potential for poverty be extreme, as for food collectors such
as these Bushmen, best that the inclination to share out one’s abundance
be made lawful. Here it is a technical condition that some households
day in and day out will fail to meet their requirements. The
vulnerability to food shortage can be met by instituting continuous
sharing within the local community. I think this the best way to
interpret tabus that prohibit hunters from eating game they bring down,
or the less drastic and more common injunction that certain large
animals be shared through the camp—“the hunter kills, other people have,
say the Yukaghir” (Jochelson, 1926, p. 124). Another way to make
food-sharing the rule, if not a rule, is to freight it heavily with
moral value. If this is the case, incidentally, sharing will break out
not merely in bad times but especially in good. The level of generalized
reciprocity “peaks” on the occasion of a windfall: now everyone can cash
in on the virtues of generosity:

They gathered almost three hundred pounds [of tsi nuts].. . . When the
people had picked all they could find, when every possible bag was full,
they said they were ready to go to Nama, but when we brought the jeep
and began to load it they were already busy with their endless
preoccupation, that of giving and receiving, and had already begun to
give each other presents of tsi. Bushmen feel a great need to give and
receive food, perhaps to cement relationships with each other, perhaps
to prove and strengthen their dependence upon each other; because the
opportunity to do this does not occur unless huge quantities of food are
at hand. Bushmen always exchange presents of foods that come in huge
quantities, these being the meat of game antelope, tsi nuts, and the
nuts of the mangetti trees, which at certain seasons are scattered
abundantly all through the mangetti forests. As we waited by the jeep
Dikai gave a huge sack of tsi to her mother. Her mother gave another
sack to Gao Feet’s first wife, and Gao Feet gave a sack to Dikai. Later,
during the days that followed, the tsi was distributed again, this time
in smaller quantities, small piles or small bagfuls, after that in
handfuls, and, last, in very small quantities of cooked tsi which people
would share as they were eating.. . .

(Thomas, 1959, pp. 214–215)

The bearing of wealth differences upon reciprocity, of course, is not
independent of the play of rank and kinship distance. Real situations
are complicated. For instance, wealth distinctions probably constrain
assistance in some inverse proportion to the kinship distance of the
sides to exchange. It is poverty in the in-group particularly that
engenders compassion. (Conversely, helping people in distress creates
very intense solidarity—on the principle of “a friend in need. . . . ”)
On the other hand, material distinctions between distant relatives or
aliens may not commensurately, or even at all, incline the affluent
party to be charitable. If the interests had been opposed to begin with,
well now the desperate traffic will bear more.

The observation is frequently made that any accumulation of wealth—among
such and such people—is followed hard upon by its disbursement. The
objective of gathering wealth, indeed, is often that of giving it away.
So, for example, Barnett writes of Northwest Coast Indians that
“Accumulation in any quantity by borrowing or otherwise is, in fact,
unthinkable unless it be for the purpose of immediate redistribution”
(1938, p. 353). The general proposition may be allowed that the material
drift in primitive societies tends on the whole away from accumulation
towards insufficiency. Thus: “In general it may be said that no one in a
Nuer village starves unless all are starving” (Evans-Pritchard, 1951, p.
132). But in view of foregoing remarks there must be qualification. The
incline toward have-nots is steeper for more urgently than for less
urgently required goods, and it is steeper within local communities than
between them.

Supposing some tendency to share in favor of need, even if qualified by
community, it is possible to draw further inferences about economic
behavior in general scarcity. During lean food seasons the incidence of
generalized exchange should rise above average, particularly in the
narrower social sectors. Survival depends now on a double-barreled
quickening of social solidarity and economic cooperation (see Appendix
C, e.g., C.1.3). This social and economic consolidation conceivably
could progress to the maximum: normal reciprocal relations between
households are suspended in favor of pooling of resources for the
duration of emergency. The rank structure is perhaps mobilized and
engaged, either in governance of pooling or in the sense that chiefly
food reserves are now put into circulation.

Yet the reaction to depression “all depends”: it depends on the social
structure put to test and on the duration and intensity of the shortage.
For the forces that countervail are strengthened in these biša-baša
times, the tendency to look to household interests especially, and also
the tendency for compassion to be more-than-proportionately expended on
close kin in need than on distant kin in the same straits. Probably
every primitive organization has its breaking-point, or at least its
turning-point. Every one might see the time when cooperation is
overwhelmed by the scale of disaster and chicanery becomes the order of
the day. The range of assistance contracts progressively to the family
level; perhaps even these bonds dissolve and, washed away, reveal an
inhuman, yet most human, self-interest. Moreover, by the same measure
that the circle of charity is compressed that of “negative reciprocity”
is potentially expanded. People who helped each other in normal times
and through the first stages of disaster display now indifference to
each others’ plight, if they do not exacerbate a mutual downfall by
guile, haggle, and theft. Put another way, the whole sectoral scheme of
reciprocities is altered, compressed: sharing is confined to the
innermost sphere of solidarity and all else is devil take the hindmost.

Implicit in these remarks is a plan of analysis of the normal sectoral
system of reciprocities in the given case. The prevailing reciprocity
scheme is some vector of the quality of kin-community relations and the
ordinary stresses developing out of imbalances in production. But it is
the emergency condition that concerns us now. Here and there in the
illustrative materials to this section we see the two predicted
reactions to depressed food supplies, both more sharing and less.
Presumably the governing conditions are the community structure on one
side and the seriousness of shortage on the other.

A final remark under the head of reciprocity and wealth. A community
will, if suitably organized, tighten not only under economic threat but
in the face of other present danger, of external political-military
pressure, for example. In this connection, two notes on the economics of
native war parties are included in the illustrative materials appended
to the present section (Appendix C: C.1.10 and C.2.5). They illustrate
an extraordinary intensity of sharing (generalized reciprocity) between
haves and have-nots during preparations for attack. (Likewise, the
experience of recent wars would show that transactions move a long way
from yesterday’s dice game in the barracks to today’s sharing of rations
or cigarettes on the front line.) The sudden outbreak of compassion is
consistent with what has been said of sociability, sharing, and wealth
differences. Generalized reciprocity is not merely the sole exchange
congruent with the now serious interdependence, it strengthens
interdependence and so the chances of each and all to survive the
noneconomic danger.

Ethnographic data relevant to the propositions of this section may be
found in Appendix C.


Reciprocity and Food

The character of the goods exchanged seems to have an independent effect
on the character of exchange. Staple foodstuffs cannot always be handled
just like anything else. Socially they are not quite like anything else.
Food is life-giving, urgent, ordinarily symbolic of hearth and home, if
not of mother. By comparison with other stuff, food is more readily, or
more necessarily, shared; barkcloth and beads more readily lend
themselves to balanced gift-giving. Direct and equivalent returns for
food are unseemly in most social settings: they impugn the motives both
of the giver and of the recipient. From this several characteristic
qualities of food transfers appear to follow.

Food dealings are a delicate barometer, a ritual statement as it were,
of social relations, and food is thus employed instrumentally as a
starting, a sustaining, or a destroying mechanism of sociability:

Food is something over which relatives have rights, and conversely
relatives are people who provide or take toll on one’s food.

(Richards, 1939, p. 200)

The sharing of food [among the Kuma] symbolizes an identity of
interests.. . . Food is never shared with an enemy.. . . Food is not
shared with strangers, for they are potential enemies. A man may eat
with his cognatic and affinal relatives and also, people say, with the
members of his own clan. Normally, however, only members of the same
subclan have an unequivocal right to share each other’s food. . .. If
two men or the members of two sub-subclans have a serious and lasting
quarrel, neither they nor their descendants may use one another’s fires.
. .. When affinal relatives come together at marriage, the formal
presentation of the bride and the pork and the valuables emphasizes the
separate identity of the two clans, but the people actually
participating in the ceremony share vegetable food informally,
unobtrusively, as they might share it with intimate companions within
the subclan. This is a way of expressing their common interest in
linking the two groups. Symbolically, they belong now to a single group
and so are “brothers,” as affinal relatives should be.

(Reay, 1959, pp. 90–92)

Food offered in a generalized way, notably as hospitality, is good
relations. As Jochelson says, putting it for the Yukaghir with
near-Confucian pith: “hospitality often turns enemies into friends, and
strengthens the amicable relations between groups foreign to one
another” (1926, p. 125). But then, a complementary negative principle is
implied, that food not offered on the suitable occasion or not taken is
bad relations. Thus the Dobuan syndrome of suspicion of everyone save
the nearest kinfolk finds its clearest expression in the social range of
food-sharing and commensality—“Food or tobacco is not accepted except
within a small circle” (Fortune, 1932, p. 170; on rules proscribing
commensality, cf. pp. 74–75; Malinowski, 1915, 545). Finally there is
the principle that one does not exchange things for food, not directly
that is, among friends and relatives. Traffic in food is traffic between
foreign interests. (Look how a novelist quite simply suggests that one
of his characters is a real bastard: “He brought his blankets to the
bare house, took silent supper with the Boss family, insisted on paying
them—he could not understand why they pretended reluctance when he
offered to pay them; food cost money; they were not in the restaurant
business, but food cost money, you could not deny that”— MacKinlay
Kantor.)

In these principles of instrumental food exchange there seems little
variation between peoples. Of course, the extent to which they are
employed, and which of them are employed, vary with the case. Dobuans
proscribe intervillage visiting and hospitality, no doubt for good and
sufficient reasons. Elsewhere, circumstances ranging from economic
interdependence through political strategy enjoin both visiting and the
hospitable entertainment of visitors. A detailed look at the
circumstances would be beyond the present purview: the point is that
where some coming to sociable terms with visitors is desirable,
hospitality is an ordinary way of doing it. And the Dobuan syndrome is
by no means typical. Ordinarily, “Savages pride themselves in being
hospitable to strangers” (Harmon, 1957, p. 43).

Consequently the sphere of generalized exchange in food is sometimes
wider than the sphere of generalized exchange in other things. This
tendency to transcend the sectoral plan is most dramatized in the
hospitality afforded trade partners, or any kinsmen from afar, who make
visits the occasion for exchanging presents (see examples in Appendix
A). Here are people whose dealings in durables are consciously balanced
out—or even potentially run on caveat emptor—by some miracle charitably
supplying one another with food and shelter. But then hospitality
counters the wabuwabu lurking in the background, and provides an
atmosphere in which direct exchange of presents and trade goods can be
equitably consummated.

There is logic in an undue tendency to move food by generalized
reciprocity. Like exchange between rich and poor, or between high and
low, where food is concerned a greater inclination to sacrifice seems
required just to sustain the given degree of sociability. Sharing needs
to be extended to more distant relatives, generalized reciprocity
broadened beyond ordinary sectoral limits. (It might be recalled from
the Appendixes to previous sections that generosity is distinctively
associated with food dealing.)

About the only sociable thing to do with food is to give it away, and
the commensurably sociable return, after an interval of suitable
decency, is the return of hospitality or assistance. The implication is
not only a rather loose or imperfect balance in food dealing, but
specifically a restraint on exchanges of food for other goods. One notes
with interest normative injunctions against the sale of food among
peoples possessed of primitive currencies, among certain Melanesian and
California tribes for instance. Here balanced exchange is run of the
mill. Money tokens serve as more or less general equivalents and are
exchanged against a variety of stuff. But not foodstuff. Within a broad
social sector where money talks for other things, staples are insulated
against pecuniary transactions and food shared perhaps but rarely sold.
Food has too much social value—ultimately because it has too much use
value—to have exchange value.

Food was not sold. It might be given away, but being “wild stuff” should
not be sold, according to Pomo etiquette. Manufactured articles only
were bought and sold, such as baskets, bows and arrows.

(Gifford, 1926, p. 329; cf. Kroeber, 1925, p. 40, on the Yurok—same sort
of thing)

[To the Tolowa-Tututni] food was only edible, not saleable.

(Drucker 1937, p. 241; cf. DuBois, 1936, pp. 50–51)

The staple articles of food, taro, bananas, coconuts, are never sold [by
Lesu], and are given to kindred, friends, and strangers passing through
the village as an act of courtesy.

(Powdermaker, 1933, p. 195)

In a similar way, staple foodstuffs were excluded from balanced trading
among Alaskan Eskimo—“The feeling was present that to trade for food was
reprehensible—and even luxury foods that were exchanged between trade
partners were transferred as presents and apart from the main trading”
(Spencer, 1959, pp. 204–205).

It would seem that common foodstuffs are likely to have an insulated
“circuit of exchange,” separate from durables, particulary wealth. (See
Firth, 1950; Bohannan, 1955; Bohannan and Dalton, 1962, on “spheres of
exchange”.) Morally and socially this should be so. For a wide range of
social relations, balanced and direct food-for-goods transactions
(conversions) would rend the solidary bonds. Distinctive categorizations
of food versus other goods, i.e., “wealth,” express the sociological
disparity and protect food from dysfunctional comparisons of its
worth—as among the Salish:

Food was not classed as “wealth” [i.e. blankets, shell ornaments,
canoes, etc.]. Nor was it treated as wealth . .. “holy food,” a
Semiah-moo informant called it. It should be given freely, he felt, and
could not be refused. Food was evidently not freely exchanged with
wealth. A person in need of food might ask to buy some from another
household in his community, offering wealth for it, but food was not
generally offered for sale.

(Suttles,1960, p. 301; Vayda, 1961)

But an important qualification must in haste be entered. These food and
nonfood spheres are sociologically based and bounded. The immorality of
food-wealth conversions has a sectoral dimension: at a certain socially
peripheral point the circuits merge and thus dissolve. (At this point,
food-for-goods exchange is a “conveyance” in Bohannan and Dalton’s
usage.) Food does not move against money or other stuff within the
community or tribe, yet it may be so exchanged outside these social
contexts, and not merely under duress but as use and wont. The Salish
did customarily take food, “holy food,” to affinal relatives in other
Salish villages and received wealth in return (Suttles, 1960). Likewise,
Pomo did “buy”— at any rate gave beads for—acorns, fish, and like
necessities from other communities (Kroeber,1925, p. 260; Loeb, 1926,
pp. 192–193). The separation of food and wealth cycles is contextual.
Within communities these are insulated circuits, insulated by community
relations; they are kept apart where a demand of return on necessities
would contradict prevailing kinship relations. Beyond this, in the
intercommunity or intertribal sector, the insulation of the food circuit
may be worn through by frictions of social distance.

(Foodstuffs, incidentally, are not ordinarily divorced from the circuit
of labor assistance. On the contrary, a meal is in the host of primitive
societies the customary return for labor solicited for gardening,
housebuilding, and other domestic tasks. “Wages” in the usual sense is
not at issue. The feeding amounts to an extraordinary extension to other
relatives and to friends of the household economy. Rather than a
tentative move toward capitalism, it is perhaps better understood by a
principle something to the opposite: that those who participate in a
productive effort have some claim on its outcome.)


On Balanced Reciprocity

We have seen generalized reciprocity in play in instrumental ways,
notably as a starting mechanism of rank distinction and also, in the
form of hospitality, as mediator of relations between persons of
different communities. Balanced reciprocity likewise finds instrumental
employments, but especially as formal social compact. Balanced
reciprocity is the classic vehicle of peace and alliance contracts,
substance-as-symbol of the transformation from separate to harmonious
interests. Group prestations are the dramatic and perhaps the typical
form, but there are instances too of interpersonal compact sealed by
exchange.

Here it is useful to recall Mauss’s dictum: “In these primitive and
archaic societies there is no middle path. . . . When two groups of men
meet they may move away or in case of mistrust or defiance they may
resort to arms; or else they can come to terms.” And the terms ought to
balance, insofar as the groups are “different men.” The relations are
too tenuous to long sustain a failure to reciprocate—“Indians notice
such things” (Goldschmidt, 1951, p. 338). They notice a lot of things.
Goldschmidt’s Nomlaki Indians in fact articulate a whole set of glosses
and paraphrases of Maussian principle, among them:

When enemies meet they call to one another. If the settlement is
friendly they approach closer and spread out their goods. One man would
throw something in the middle, one man from the other side would throw
in something for it and take the traded material back. They trade till
one side has traded everything. The ones that have some left make fun of
those who have run out, bragging about themselves.. . . This trade takes
place on the border line.

(Goldschmidt, 1951, p. 338)

Balanced reciprocity is willingness to give for that which is received.
Therein seems to be its efficacy as social compact. The striking of
equivalence, or at least some approach to balance, is a demonstrable
foregoing of self-interest on each side, some renunciation of hostile
intent or of indifference in favor of mutuality. Against the preexisting
context of separateness, the material balance signifies a new state of
affairs. This is not to deny that the transaction is consequential in a
utilitarian sense, as it may well be—and the social effect perhaps
compounded by an equitable exchange of different necessities. But
whatever the utilitarian value, and there need be none, there is always
a “moral” purpose, as Radcliffe-Brown remarked of certain Andaman
transactions: “to provide a friendly feeling . . . and unless it did
this it failed of its purpose.”

Among the many kinds of contract struck as it were by balanced exchange,
the following seem most common:

Formal Friendship or Kinship

These are interpersonal compacts of solidarity, pledges of brotherhood
in some cases, friendship in others. The alliance may be sealed by
exchange of identical goods, the material counterpart of some exchange
of identities, but at any rate the transaction is likely to balance and
the exchange is of distant for close relationship (e.g., Pospisil, 1958,
pp. 86–87; Seligman, 1910, pp. 69–70). An association once so formed may
well become more sociable over time, and future transactions both
parallel and compound this trend by becoming more generalized.

Affirmation of Corporate Alliances

One may place in this category the various feasts and entertainments
reciprocally tendered between friendly local groups and communities,
such as certain of the interclan vegetable-heap presentations in the New
Guinea Highlands or inter-village social feasts in Samoa or New Zealand.

Peace-Making

These are the exchanges of settlement, of cessation of dispute, feud,
and warfare. Both interpersonal and collective hostilities may be thus
quieted by exchange. “ ‘When an equivalence is struck’, parties to an
Abelam argument are satisfied: ‘talk is thrown away’ ’’(Kaberry, 1941–
42, p. 341). That is the general principle.

One may wish to include wergeld payments, compensations for adultery,
and other forms of compounding injury in this category, as well as the
exchanges that terminate warfare. They all work on the same general
principle of fair trade. (Spencer provides an interesting Eskimo
example: when a man received compensation from the abductor of his wife,
the two men “inevitably” became friendly, he writes, “because they had
conceptually effected a trade” [1959, p. 81]. See also Denig, 1928–29,
p. 404; Powdermaker, 1933, p. 197; Williamson, 1912, p. 183; Deacon,
1934, p. 226; Kroeber, 1925, p. 252; Loeb, 1926, pp. 204–205; Hogbin,
1939, pp. 79, 91–92; etc.)

Marital Alliance

Marriage prestations are of course the classic form of exchange as
social compact. I have little to add to the received anthropological
discussion, except a slight qualification about the character of
reciprocity in these transactions, and even this may be superfluous.

It does sometimes miss the point, however, to view marital exchange as
perfectly balanced prestation. The transactions of marriage, and perhaps
contingent future affinal exchange as well, are often not exactly equal.
For one thing, an asymmetry of quality is commonplace: women move
against hoes or cattle, toga against oloa, fish against pigs. In the
absence of some secular convertibility, or of a mutual standard of
value, the transfer seems to an extent one of incomparables; neither
equivalent nor total, the transaction may be of incommensurables. In any
event, and even where the same sorts of things are exchanged, one side
or the other may be conceived to benefit unduly, at least for the time
being. This lack of precise balance is socially of the essence.

For unequal benefit sustains the alliance as perfect balance could not.
Truly, the people concerned—and/or the ethnographer—might muse that in
the fullness of time accounts between affines even out. Or losses and
gains may be cancelled by circular or statistical patterns of alliance.
Or some balance in goods, at least, may obtain in the total political
economy, where the flow of payments upwards (against a flow of women
downwards) through a series of ranked lineages is reversed by
redistribution from the top (cf. Leach, 1951). Yet it is socially
critical that over a certain term, and perhaps forever, the exchange
between two groups united by a marriage has not been balanced. Insofar
as the things transferred are of different quality, it may be difficult
ever to calculate that the sides are “even-steven.” This is a social
good. The exchange that is symmetrical or unequivocally equal carries
some disadvantage from the point of view of alliance: it cancels debts
and thus opens the possibility of contracting out. If neither side is
“owing” then the bond between them is comparatively fragile. But if
accounts are not squared, then the relationship is maintained by virtue
of “the shadow of indebtedness,” and there will have to be further
occasions of association, perhaps as occasions of further payment.

Moreover, and quite obviously, an asymmetrical exchange of different
things lends itself to alliance that is complementary. The marital bond
between groups is not always, maybe not even usually, some sort of
fifty-fifty partnership between homologous parties. One group surrenders
a woman, another gets her; in a patrilineal context the wife-receivers
have secured continuity, something at the expense of the wife-givers, at
least on this occasion. There has been a differential transfer: the
groups are socially related in a complementary and asymmetrical way.
Likewise, in a ranked lineage system the giving of women may be a
specification of the set of subordinate-superordinate relations. Now in
these cases, the several rights and duties of alliance are symbolized by
the differential character of transfers, are attached to complementary
symbols. Asymmetrical prestations secure the complementary alliance once
again as perfectly balanced, symmetrical, or all-out total prestations
would not.

The casual received view of reciprocity supposes some fairly direct
one-for-one exchange, balanced reciprocity, or a near approximation of
balance. It may not be inappropriate, then, to footnote this discussion
with a respectful demur: that in the main run of primitive societies,
taking into account directly utilitarian as well as instrumental
transactions, balanced reciprocity is not the prevalent form of
exchange. A question might even be raised about the stability of
balanced reciprocity. Balanced exchange may tend toward
self-liquidation. On one hand, a series of honorably balanced dealings
between comparatively distant parties builds trust and confidence, in
effect reduces social distance, and so increases the chances for more
generalized future dealings—as the initial blood-brotherhood transaction
creates a “credit rating,” as it were. On the other hand, a renege acts
to sever relations—as failure to make returns breaks a
trade-partnership—if it does not actually invite chicanery in return.
May we conclude that balanced reciprocity is inherently unstable? Or
perhaps that it requires special conditions for continuity?

The societal profile of reciprocity, at any rate, most often inclines
toward generalized modes. In the simpler hunting groups the generalized
assistance of close kinship seems usually dominant; in neolithic
chiefdoms this is supplemented by kinship-rank obligations. There are
nonetheless societies of certain type in which balanced exchange, if not
exactly dominant, acquires unusual prominence. Interest attaches to
these societies, not alone for the emphasis on balanced reciprocity, but
for what goes with it.

The well-known “labor exchange” in Southeast Asian hinterland
communities brings these immediately to mind. Here is a set of peoples
who, placed against the main run of primitive societies, offer
departures in economy, and social structure as well, that cannot fail to
kindle a comparative interest. The well-described Iban (Freeman 1955,
1960), Land Dayak (Geddes, 1954, 1957; cf. Provinse,1937) and Lamet
(Izikowitz,1951) belong in the class—some Philippine peoples may as
well, but I am uncertain how far the analysis about to be suggested will
work for the Philippines.

Now these societies are distinctive not only for uncommon internal
characteristics of economy but for unusual external relations— unusual,
that is, in a strictly primitive milieu. They are hinterlands engaged by
petty market trade—and perhaps also by political dominance (e.g.,
Lamet)—to more sophisticated cultural centers. From the perspective of
the advanced centers, they are backwaters serving as secondary sources
of rice and other goods (cf. VanLeur, 1955, especially pp. 101 f, for
some hints about the economic significance of hinterland provisioning in
Southeast Asia). From the hinterlands view, the critical aspect of the
intercultural relation is that the subsistence staple, rice, is exported
for cash, iron tools, and prestige goods, many of the last quite
expensive. It is suggested—with all the deference that must be supplied
by one who has no research experience in the area—that the peculiar
social-economic character of Southeast Asian hinterland tribes is
congruent with this unusual deployment of household subsistence
surpluses. The implication of an external trade in rice is not merely an
internal ban on sharing it, or a corresponding requirement of
quid-pro-quo in intracommunity dealings, but departure from ordinary
characteristics of primitive distribution in virtually all respects.

The engagement with the market makes a key minimal demand: that internal
community relations permit household accumulation of rice, else the
amounts required for external exchange will never be forthcoming. This
stipulation must prevail in the face of limited and uncertain modes of
rice production. The fortunate households cannot be responsible for the
unfortunate; if internal leveling is encouraged then the external trade
relations are simply not sustained.

The set of consequences for the economy and polity of the hinterland
tribal communities appear to include: (1) Different households, by
virtue of variations in ratio and number of effective producers, amass
different amounts of the subsistence-export staple. The productive
differences range between surfeit above and deficit below family
consumption requirements. These differences, however, are not liquidated
by sharing in favor of need. Instead (2) the intensity of sharing within
the village or tribe is low, and (3) the principal reciprocal relation
between households is a closely calculated balanced exchange of labor
service. As Geddes remarks of the Land Dayak: “.. co-operation beyond
the household, except on business lines where every service must have an
equal return, is at a low level” (1954, p. 34). Balanced labor-exchange,
of course, maintains the productive advantage (accumulation capacity) of
the family with more adult workers. The only goods that customarily move
in generalized reciprocity are game and perhaps large domestic animals
sacrificed in family ceremonies. Such items are widely distributed
through the community (cf. Izikowitz, 1951), much as hunters would share
them, but the sharing of meat is not as decisive in structuring
interfamilial relations as the lack of sharing decreed by export of
staples. (4) Even household commensality may be rather rigidly
supervised, subjected to accounting of each person’s rice dole in the
interest of developing an exchange reserve, hence less sociable than
ordinary primitive commensality (compare, for example, Izikowitz, 1951,
pp. 301–302 with Firth, 1936, pp. 112– 116). (5) Restricted sharing of
staples, demanded by articulation with the siphoning market, finds its
social complement in an atomization and fragmentation of community
structure. Lineages, or like systems of extensive and corporate solidary
relations, are incompatible with the external drain on household staples
and the corresponding posture of self-interest required vis-à-vis other
households. Large local descent groups are absent or inconsequential.
Instead, the solidary relations are of the small family itself, with
various and changing interpersonal kin ties the only such nexus of
connection between households. Economically, these extended kin ties are
weak ones:

A household is not only a distinct unit, but one which minds its own
business. Perforce, it has to do so, because it has with other
households no formal relations, sanctioned by custom, on which it can
rely for certain support. Indeed, the absence of such structured
relationships is a condition of the society as at present organized. In
the main economic affairs, cooperation with others is based upon
contract and not primarily upon kinship. . .. As a result of this
situation, ties which persons have with others in the community tend to
be widespread, but limited to sentiment and sociability, often sadly so.

(Geddes, 1954, p. 42)

(6) Prestige apparently hinges upon obtaining exotic items—Chinese
pottery, brass gongs, etc.—from the outside in exchange for rice or
work. Prestige does not, obviously cannot, rest on generous assistance
to one’s fellows in the manner of a tribal big-man. The exotic goods
figure internally as ceremonial display items and in marriage
prestations—thus insofar as status is linked to them it is principally
as possession and ability to make payments, again not through giving
them away. (“Wealth does not help a man to become chief because it gives
him power to distribute largesse. Riches rarely incline a Dayak to
charity, although they may to usury’’ [Geddes, 1954, p.50].) No one then
obligates others very much. No one creates followers. As a result there
are no strong leaders, a fact which probably contributes to the
atomization of the community and may have repercussions on the intensity
of land use (cf. Izikowitz, 1951).

In these Southeast Asian communities, the prevalence of balanced
reciprocity does seem connected with special circumstances. But then the
circumstances suggest that it is not legitimate to involve these peoples
in the present context of tribal economics. By the same token, their use
in debating issues of primitive economics, as Geddes uses the Land Dayak
to argue against “primitive communism,” seems not very pertinent.
Perhaps they are best classed with peasants—so long as one does not
thereupon suggest, as is unfortunately often done under the label
“economic anthropology,” that “peasant” and “prim-itive” belong together
in some undifferentiated type of economy distinguished negatively as
whatever-it-is that is outside the province of orthodox economic
analysis.

There are, however, incontestable examples of societal emphasis on
balanced reciprocity in primitive settings. Primitive monies serving as
media of exchange at more or less fixed rates argue this. The monies
amount to the suggested special mechanisms for maintaining balance. It
is worthwhile to inquire into their incidence and their economic and
social concomitants.

Yet this is not to be hazarded without some formal definition of
“primitive money,” a problem approaching the status of a classic dilemma
in comparative economics. On one side, any thing that has a “money
use”—as we know money uses: payments, exchange, standard, etc.—may be
taken for “money.” If so, probably every society enjoys the dubious
benefits, inasmuch as some category of goods is usually earmarked for
certain payments. The alternative is less relativistic and therefore
seems more useful for comparative generalizations: to agree on some
minimal use and quality of the stuff. The strategy, as Firth suggests,
is not to question “What is primitive money?” but “What is it useful to
include in the category of primitive money?” (1959, p. 39). His specific
suggestion, which as I understand it centrally involves the
medium-of-exchange function, does indeed appear useful. (“My own view is
that to entitle an object to be classified as money, it should be of a
generally acceptable type, serving to facilitate the conversion of one
object or service into terms of another and used as a standard of value
thereby” [Firth, 1959, pp. 38–39].)

Let “money” refer to those objects in primitive societies that have
token value rather than use value and that serve as means of exchange.
The exchange use is limited to certain categories of things—land and
labor are ordinarily excluded—and is brought to bear only between
parties of certain social relation. In the main it serves as an indirect
bridge between goods (C-M-C’) rather than commercial purposes (M-C-M’).
These limitations would justify the phrase “primitive money.” If all
this is agreeable, it further appears that pristine developments of
primitive money are not broadly spread through the ethnographic scene,
but are restricted to certain areas: especially western and central
Melanesia, aboriginal California, and certain parts of the South
American tropical forest. (Monies may also have developed in pristine
contexts in Africa, but I am not expert enough to disentangle their
distribution from archaic civilizations and ancient “interna-tional”
trade.)

This is also to say that primitive money is associated with an
historically specific type of primitive economy, an economy with a
marked incidence of balanced exchange in peripheral social sectors. It
is not a phenomenon of simple hunting cultures—if I may be permitted,
cultures of a band level. Neither is primitive money characteristic of
the more advanced chiefdoms, where wealth tokens though certainly
encountered tend to bear little exchange load. The regions noted—
Melanesia, California, South American tropical forest—are (or were)
occupied by societies of an intermediate sort, such as have been called
“tribal” (Sahlins,1961; Service, 1962) or “homogeneous” and “seg-mented
tribes” (Oberg,1955). They are distinguished from band systems not
merely for more settled conditions of life—often associated with
neolithic versus paleolithic production—but principally for a larger and
more complex tribal organization of constituent local groupings. The
several local settlements of tribal societies are bound together both by
a nexus of kin relations and by cross-cutting social institutions, such
as a set of clans. Yet the relatively small settlements are autonomous
and self-governing, a feature which in turn distinguishes tribal from
chiefdom plans. The local segments of the latter are integrated into
larger polities, as divisions and subdivisions, by virtue of principles
of rank and a structure of chieftainships and subchief-tainships. The
tribal plan is purely segmental, the chiefdom pyramidal.

This evolutionary classification of social-cultural types is admittedly
loose. I hope not to raise an issue over it, for it has been offered
merely to direct attention to contrasting structural features of
primitive-money areas. They are precisely the kinds of features that,
given previous argumentation, suggest an unusual incidence of balanced
reciprocity. A greater play of balanced exchange in tribal over band
societies is argued in part by a greater proportion of craft goods and
services in the societal economic output. Foodstuffs, while still the
decisive share of a tribal economic product, decline relatively.
Transactions in durables, more likely to be balanced than food
transactions, increase. But more important, the proportion of
peripheral-sector exchange, the incidence of exchange among more
distantly related people, is likely to be considerably greater in tribal
than in band societies. This is understandable by reference to the more
definite segmental plan of tribes, which is also to say the more
definite sectoral breaks in the social structure.

The several residential segments of tribes are comparatively stable and
formally constituted. And a corporate political solidarity is as
characteristic of the tribal segment as it is lacking in flexible
camp-and-band arrangements of hunters. Tribal segmental structure is
also more extensive, including perhaps internal lineage groupings in the
political segments, the set (and sometimes segmentary subsets) of
political segments, and the tribal-foreigner division. Now the accretion
over band organization is particularly in peripheral structure, in the
development of the intratribal and intertribal sectors. Here is where
exchange encounters increase, whether these be instrumental, peacemaking
exchanges, or frankly materialistic dealings. The accretion in exchange
then is in the social areas of balanced reciprocity.

A chiefdom, in further contrast, liquidates and pushes out peripheral
sectors by transforming external into internal relations, by including
adjacent local groups within enclaving political unions. At the same
time, the incidence of balanced reciprocity is depressed, in virtue of
both the “internalization” of exchange relations and their
centralization. Balanced exchanges should thus decline in favor of more
generalized with the attainment of a chiefdom level. The implication for
primitive money is perhaps illustrated by its absence in the
Tro-briands, despite the fact that this island of chiefdoms is set in a
sea of money-using tribes, or by the progressive attentuation in
exchange-uses of shell beads moving northward from tribal California to
proto-chiefdom British Columbia.

The hypothesis about primitive money—offered with due caution and
deference—is this: it occurs in conjunction with unusual incidence of
balanced reciprocity in peripheral social sectors. Presumably it
facilitates the heavy balanced traffic. The conditions that encourage
primitive money are most likely to occur in the range of primitive
societies called “tribal” and are unlikely to be served by band or
chiefdom development. But a qualification must in haste be entered. Not
all tribes provide circumstances for monetary development and certainly
not all enjoy primitive money, as the term is here understood. For the
potentiality of peripheral exchange is maximized only by some tribes.
Others remain relatively inner-directed.

First, peripheral sectors become scenes of intensive exchange in
conjunction with regional and intertribal symbiosis. An areal ecological
regime of specialized tribes, the respective families and communities of
which are in trade relation, is probably a necessary condition for
primitive money. Such regimes are characteristic of California and
Melanesia—about South America I am not prepared to say—but in other
tribal settings symbiosis is not characteristic and the intertribal (or
interregional) exchange sector is comparatively underdeveloped. Perhaps
just as important are circumstances that put premiums on delayed
exchange and so on tokens that store value in the interim. The outputs
of interdependent communities, for example, may be unavoidably
unbalanced in time—as between coastal and inland peoples, where an
exchangeable catch of fish cannot always be met by complementary inland
products. Here a currency acceptable on all sides very much facilitates
interdependence—so that shell beads, say, taken for fish at one time can
be converted for acorns at another (cf. Vayda, 1954; Loeb, 1926).
Big-man leadership systems, it would seem from Melanesia, may likewise
render delayed balanced exchange functional. The tribal big-man operates
on a fund of power consisting of food, pigs, or the like, stuffs with
the common quality that they are not easy to keep around in large
amounts over long periods. But, at the same time, the extractive devices
for accumulating these political funds are underdeveloped, and
collection of goods for a climactic giveaway would have to be gradual
and thus technically difficult. The dilemma is resolvable by monetary
manipulations: by converting wealth into tokens and by calculated
deployment of money in loans and exchange, so that a time will come when
a massive call on goods can be made and the whole fund of wealth, given
away, converted into status.


An Afterthought

It is difficult to conclude with a dramatic flourish. The essay has not
a dramatic structure—its main drift seems downhill. And a summary would
be needlessly repetitive.

But there is a curiosity worth remarking. Here has been given a
discourse on economics in which “economizing” appears mainly as an
exogenous factor! The organizing principles of economy have been sought
elsewhere. To the extent they have been found outside man’s presumed
hedonist propensity, a strategy for the study of primitive economics is
suggested that is something the reverse of economic orthodoxy. It may be
worth while to see how far this heresy will get us.


APPENDIX A

Notes on Reciprocity and Kinship Distance

-   A.1.0 Hunters and Gatherers — Generally, sectoral breaks in
    reciprocity not always as definite as for neolithic peoples, but
    variation in reciprocity by interpersonal kinship distance apparent.
    Generalized reciprocity often consists of specific obligations to
    render goods to certain kinsmen (kinship dues) rather than
    altruistic assistance. Notable differences between the handling of
    foods and durables.
-   A.1.1 Bushmen — The!Kung term lack of generosity or failure to
    reciprocate “far-hearted”—a felicitious choice of words, from our
    perspective.

    Three social-material breaking points in reciprocity are apparent in
    Marshall’s (1961) paper on!Kung exchange: (1) a range of close kin
    in the camp with whom meat is shared, often as customary
    obligation; (2) more distant kin within the camp and other Bushmen,
    with whom economic relations are characterized by “gift-giving” of
    durables in a more balanced fashion and transactions in meat that
    approximate “gift-giving”; (3) “trade” with Bantu. Marshall’s
    materials are rich and indicate the play of various social
    considerations and sanctions determining specific transactions.
    Large game moves through a camp in several waves. Initially it is
    pooled in the hunting party by the taker, with shares going also to
    the arrow. “In the second distribution [here we move into
    reciprocity proper] close kinship is the factor which sets the
    pattern of the giving. Certain obligations are compulsory. A man’s
    first obligation at this point, we were told, is to give to his
    wife’s parents. He must give to them the best he has in as generous
    portions as he can, while still fulfilling other primary
    obligations, which are to his own parents, his spouse, and offspring
    [note, these cook and eat meat separately]. He keeps a portion for
    himself at this time and from it would give to his siblings, to his
    wife’s siblings, if they are present, and to other kin, affines, and
    friends who are there, possibly only in small quantities by then.
    Everyone who receives meat gives again, in another wave of sharing,
    to his or her parents, parents-in-law, spouses, offspring, siblings,
    and others. The meat may be cooked and the quantities small.
    Visitors, even though they are not close kin or affines, are given
    meat by the people whom they are visiting” (Marshall, 1961, p. 238).
    Beyond the range of close kin, giving meat is a matter of individual
    inclination in which friendship, obligation to return past favors,
    and other considerations come into account. But this giving is
    definitely more balanced: “In the later waves of sharing when the
    primary distribution and the primary kinship obligations have been
    fulfilled, the giving of meat from one’s own portion has the quality
    of gift-giving.!Kung society requires at this point only that a
    person should give with reasonable generosity in proportion to what
    he has received and not keep more than an equitable amount for
    himself in the end, and that the person who receives a gift of meat
    must give a reciprocal gift some time in the future” (p. 239).
    Marshall reserves “gift-giving” to the exchange of durables; this
    occurs also, and importantly, between!Kung of different bands. One
    should neither refuse such gifts nor fail to make a return. Much of
    the gift-giving is instrumental, having principally social effects.
    Even asking for a thing, claimed one man, “formed a love” between
    people. It means “he still loves me, that is why he is asking.” And
    Marshall adds laconically, “At least it forms a something between
    people, I thought” (p. 245). “Gift-giving” is distinguishable from
    “trade” both in form of reciprocity and social sector. “In
    reciprocating [a gift] one does not give the same object back again
    but something of comparable value. The interval of time between
    receiving and reciprocating varied from a few weeks to a few years.
    Propriety requires that there be no unseemly haste. The giving must
    not look like trading” (p. 244). The mechanics of trading are not
    specified. “Negotiation” however is mentioned; the implication is of
    haggle. The social sphere is in any case clear: “The!Kung do not
    trade among themselves. They consider the procedure undignified and
    avoid it because it is too likely to stir up bad feelings. They
    trade with Bantu, however, in the settlements along the B.P. border.
    . . . The odds are with the Bantu in the trading. Big, aggressive,
    and determined to have what they want, they easily intimidate the
    Bushmen. Several!Kung informants said that they tried not to trade
    with Herero if it was possible to avoid it because, although the
    Tswana were hard bargainers, the Herero were worse”(p. 242).

    Intense generalized reciprocity within Bushmen camps and
    bands—especially food-sharing—is also indicated by Thomas (1959, pp.
    22, 50, 214–215) and Schapera (1930, pp. 98–101, 148). Interband
    exchange, however, is characterized as “barter” by Schapera
    (1930, p. 146; cf. Thomas’s amusing anecdote of the trouble that
    developed between a man and woman of different groups over an
    unrequited gift presented to the father of the former by the woman’s
    father [1959, pp. 240–242].)

    Theft reported unknown to them (Marshall, 1961, pp. 245– 246;
    Thomas, 1959, pp. 206). However, Schapera implies it exists
    (1930, p. 148).

-   A.1.2 Congo Pygmies — In general, the scheme of reciprocity looks
    very much like the Bushmen’s, including a rather impersonal exchange
    with “Negroes” (Putnam, 1953, p. 322; Schebesta 1933, p. 42;
    Turnbull, 1962). Hunting spoils, large game especially, are shared
    out in the camp, on a kinship-distance basis it appears—Putnam
    implies that first the family shares, then the “family group” gets
    shares (1953, p. 332; cf. Sche-besta, 1933, pp. 68, 124, 244).
-   A.1.3 Washo — “Sharing obtained at every level of Washo social
    organization. Sharing also decreased as kinship and residence
    distances increased” (Price, 1962, p. 37). It is difficult to say
    where “trade” leaves off and “gift-giving” begins, but “In trade
    there tended to be immediate reciprocation while gift exchange often
    involved a time lapse. Trade also tended to be competitive and to
    increase with less intense social ties. Trade involved explicit
    negotiation and social status was secondary as a factor in the
    transaction” (p. 49).
-   A.1.4 Semang — Sharp sectoral break in reciprocity at the “family
    group” (band) border: “Each family contributes from its own food,
    already cooked and prepared, to every other family. If one family on
    any particular day is unusually well supplied, they give generously
    to all kindred families, even if it leaves them with too little. If
    other families not belonging to the group are in the camp, they do
    not share, or only to a very small extent, in the distribution”
    (Schebesta, n.d., p. 84).
-   A.1.5 Andamans — Radcliffe-Brown’s (1948) account suggests a higher
    level of generalized reciprocity within the local group,
    particularly in food dealings and in transactions between junior and
    senior generations (cf. pp. 42–43), and more balanced forms of
    reciprocity between people of different bands, particularly in
    durables. The exchange of presents is characteristic of interband
    meetings, an exchange that could amount to swapping local
    specialties. In this sector, “It requires a good deal of tact to
    avoid the unpleasantness that may arise if a man thinks he has not
    received things as valuable as he has given” (p. 43; cf. pp. 83–84;
    Man, n.d., p. 120).
-   A.1.6 Australian Aboriginals — A number of formal, compulsory kin
    dues and also formal precedence orders for sharing food and other
    goods with relatives of the camp (see Elkin, 1954, pp. 110–111;
    Meggitt, 1962, pp. 118, 120, 131, 139, etc.; Warner, 1937, pp. 63,
    70, 92–95; Spencer and Gillen, 1927, p. 490). A strong obligation to
    share out food in the horde (Radcliffe-Brown, 1930–31, p. 438;
    Spencer and Gillen, 1927, pp. 37–39).

    Yir-Yiront exchange seems to parallel the Bushman scheme (above).
    Sharp notes that reciprocity varies on both sides of the set of
    customary kin dues, toward balance beyond and toward generalized
    reciprocity in the narrowest sphere of closest kin. Giving to
    persons outside the range of those entitled dues “amounts to
    compulsory exchange. . . . But there is also irregular giving,
    though within a relatively narrow social range, for which the
    incentives seem to be chiefly sentimental, and which may be
    considered altruistic; this may lead to a desire to acquire property
    in order to give it away” (Sharp, 1934–35, pp. 37–38).

    On the connection between assistance and close kinship: Meggitt
    observes of the Walbiri that “. . . a man who has several spears
    parts with them willingly; but, should he have only one, his son or
    father should not ask for it. If he is asked, the man usually gives
    the single article to an actual or close father or son, but he
    refuses distant ‘fathers’ and ‘sons’ ” (Meggitt, 1962, p. 120).

    Balanced reciprocity, in various specific guises, is characteristic
    of the well-known interband and intertribal trade exchange, which is
    often effected by trade partners who are classificatory kin (see,
    for example, Sharp, 1952, pp. 76–77; Warner, 1937, pp. 95, 145).

-   A.1.7 Eskimo — High level of generalized reciprocity in the camp,
    associated by Birket-Smith with “the fellowship of the settlement.”
    This concerns food in the main, particularly large animals, and
    especially during the winter season (Birket-Smith, 1959, p. 146;
    Spencer, 1959, pp. 150, 153, 170; Boas, 1884– 85, p. 562; Rink,
    1875, p. 27).

    Taken all in all, Spencer’s study of the North Alaskan Eskimo
    suggests significant differences between the reciprocity appropriate
    among kinsmen, among trade partners, and among nonkin who are also
    not trade partners. These variations concern durables, especially
    trade goods. Nonkin within the camp would presumably be given some
    food if they are short, but trade goods are exchanged with them, as
    well as with outsiders (who are not trade partners), in an
    impersonal “bidding” transaction (reminiscent of Brazilian Indians’
    “trade game”). Trade partnerships are formed—on quasi-kin or
    institutional-friendship lines—between coastal and inland men; the
    exchange is of local specialties. Partners deal without haggle,
    indeed try to extend themselves, yet without balance (or near
    balance) in exchange the partnership would dissolve. Trade relations
    are specifically distinguished by Spencer from kinship-generalized
    reciprocity. Thus kinsmen do not need to enter into partnership, he
    says, for “A relative would always be of assistance, an arrangement
    which pointed primarily to the sharing of food and granting of
    shelter” (Spencer, 1959, pp. 65–66). Again: “One would not form a
    partnership with a brother, the theory being that one secured
    assistance and aid from one’s close relatives in any case” (p. 170).

-   A.1.8 Shoshoni — When a family did not have a great deal to share
    out, as when only seeds or small animals had been taken, that given
    out was to close relatives and neighbors (Steward, 1938, pp. 74,
    231, 240, 253). There seems to have been a fairly high level of
    generalized reciprocity in the village, which Steward links to the
    “high degree of [kin] relationship between village members” (p.
    239).
-   A.1.9 Northern Tungus (mounted hunters) — Much sharing within the
    clan, but food sharing most intense within the few families of a
    clan that nomadized together (Shirokogoroff, 1929, pp. 195, 200,
    307). According to Shirokogoroff, gift-giving among Tungus was not
    reciprocal, and Tungus resented Manchu expectations on his head (p.
    99); however, he also wrote that gifts were given to guests (over
    and above ordinary hospitality) and these items should be
    reciprocated (p. 333). Reindeer sold only outside the clan; inside,
    pass as gifts and assistance (pp. 35–36).
-   A.2.0 Oceania — The sectoral system of reciprocities is often more
    clear and more definite, especially in Melanesia. In Polynesia it is
    overriden by centralization of reciprocities in chiefly hands or by
    redistribution.
-   A.2.1 ’Gawa (Busama) — Hogbin contrasts maritime intertribal trade
    through partnerships and inland trade with unrelated peoples, saying
    of the latter exchange: “The parties seem slightly ashamed, however,
    and conclude their arrangements outside the village. [Note the
    literal exclusion of impersonal exchange from the ’Gawa village:]
    Commerce it is considered, should be carried on away from where
    people live, preferably alongside the road or the beach (the
    native-owned store at Busama is located fifty yards from the nearest
    dwelling). The Busama sum up the situation by saying that the
    maritime people give one another presents but insist on a proper
    return from the bushmen. The basis of the distinction is that on the
    coast activities are confined to relatives, but so few of the beach
    folk have kinsmen in the hill country that most transactions take
    place of necessity between comparative strangers. [Hog-bin mentions
    elsewhere that the bush trade is often recent.] A certain amount of
    migration and intermarriage has taken place around the seaboard, and
    every coastal native has kinsmen in some of the other shore
    villages, especially those close at hand. When trading by sea it is
    with these, and these only, that he makes exchanges. Kinship ties
    and bargaining are considered to be incompatible, and all goods are
    handed over as free gifts offered from motives of sentiment.
    Discussion of values is avoided, and the donor does the best he can
    to convey the impression that no thought of a counter gift has
    entered his head. Yet at a later stage, when a convenient
    opportunity arises, hints are dropped of what is expected, whether
    pots, mats, baskets, or food. . . . Most of the visitors go home
    with items at least as valuable as those with which they came.
    Indeed, the closer the kinship bond the greater the host’s
    generosity is, and some of them return a good deal richer. A careful
    count is kept, however, and the score is afterwards made even. . . .
    [The account goes on to give examples and to note that failure to
    balance will cause termination of the partnership. Now, contrast the
    foregoing with reciprocity in the intravillage sector:] It is
    significant that when a Busama acquired a string bag from a fellow
    villager, as has recently become possible, he always gives twice
    what he would pay to a more distant relative [i.e., trading partner]
    on the north coast. ‘One is ashamed,’ the people explain, ‘to treat
    those with whom one is familiar like a tradesman’ ” (Hogbin, 1951,
    pp. 83–86). The variation in reciprocity by linear-kinship distance
    is also worth noting: “A presentation [of a pig] from a close
    relative imposes the usual obligation to return an animal of
    equivalent size on some future occasion, but no money changes hands
    either when the original gift is made or later. A similar obligation
    exists between distant kinsmen, but in this case each pig has also
    to be paid for at its full market price. The transaction is in line
    with earlier practice, except that dog’s teeth then served as
    payment. The members of the purchasers’ group help him nowadays with
    a few shillings, just as formerly they would have given him a string
    or two of teeth” (p. 124).
-   A.2.2 Kuma — Generalized reciprocity is prevalent within such
    small-scale descent groups as the “sub-subclan”—“a bank and a labour
    force for its members” (Reay, 1959, p. 29)—and the subclan (p. 70).
    The interclan sector is characterized by balanced exchange, by “the
    general emphasis on exact reciprocity between groups” (p. 47; see
    also pp. 55, 86–89, 126). In the external sector, balance is
    appropriate between trade-partners, but without a partnership the
    transaction inclines toward negative reciprocity. “In Kuma trading,
    there are two distinct forms: institutionalized transactions through
    trading partners, and casual encounters along the trade routes. In
    the former, a man is content to conform to the ruling scale of
    values . . . but in the latter he haggles for a bargain, trying to
    gain a material advantage. The term for ‘trading partner’ is, most
    significantly, a verb form, ‘I together I-eat.’ . . . He is, as it
    were, drawn into the ‘in-group’ of clansmen and affines, the people
    who should not be exploited for private ends” (pp. 106–107, 110).
    Hospitality runs alongside the balanced exchange of trade goods
    between partners, and “to exploit a partner for material gain is to
    lose him” (p. 109). Nonpart-nership exchange is mostly a recent
    development.
-   A.2.3 Buin Plain, Bougainville — Sectoral distinctions in
    reciprocity among the Siuai have been indicated in previous textual
    citations. A few further aspects can be mentioned here. First, on
    the extremely generalized reciprocity appropriate among very close
    kinship: “Gift-giving among close relatives over and beyond the
    normal expectations of sharing [“sharing” as Oliver defines it is
    the “pooling” of the present essay] cannot entirely be reduced to
    conscious expectation of reciprocity. A father might rationalize the
    giving of tidbits to his son by explaining that he expected to be
    cared for by the latter in his old age, but I am convinced that some
    giving between, say, father and son does not involve any desire or
    expectation for reciprocation” (Oliver, 1955, p. 230). Loans of
    productive goods normally brought over-and-above returns
    (“interest”), but not from close relatives (p. 229). Exchange
    between distant relatives and trade partners is ootu: it is
    characterized by approximate equivalence but is distinguished from
    “sales” involving shell money (as the sale of craft goods) by the
    possibility of deferring payments in ootu (pp. 230–231). In
    trade-partner transactions, also, giving above going rates is
    creditable, so that balance is achieved perhaps only over the long
    term (see pp. 297, 299, 307, 350–351, 367–368).

    Sectoral variations in the economy of the Buin neighbors of the
    Siuai (the Terei, apparently) so impressed Thurnwald that he
    suggested the existence of three “kinds of economics: (1) the
    husbandry [pooling] within the family . . .; (2) the
    inter-individual and inter-familial help among near relatives and
    members of a settlement united under a chief; (3) the inter-communal
    relations manifested by barter between individuals belonging to
    different communities or strata of society” (Thurnwald, 1934–35, p.
    124).

-   A.2.4 Kapauku — The difference in reciprocity between interregional
    and intraregional sectors of the Kapauku economy has been noted in
    textual citation (above). Also notable is the fact that kinship and
    friendship ties lower customary rates of exchange in Kapauku
    shell-money dealings (Pospisil, 1958, p. 122). The Kapauku data are
    rendered obscure by an inappropriate economic terminology. So-called
    “loans,” for example, are generalized transactions— “take it without
    repayment in the immediate future” (p. 78; see also p. 130)—but the
    social context and extent of these “loans” is not clear.
-   A.2.5 Mafulu — Excepting pig-exchange, which the ethnographer
    discounts as a ceremonial affair, “Exchange and barter is generally
    only engaged in between members of different communities and not
    between those of the same community” (Williamson, 1912, p. 232).
-   A.2.6 Manus — Affinal exchanges, ordinarily between Manus of the
    same or different villages, are distinguished by long-term credit,
    compared with the short-term credit of trade friendship or market
    exchange (Mead, 1937, p. 218). Trade-friendship exchange, while more
    or less balanced, is in turn to be differentiated from the more
    impersonal “market” exchange with Usiai bushfellows. The trade
    friendships are developed with people of distant tribes, sometimes
    on long-standing kinship ties. Some credit is extended to trade
    friends, as well as hospitality, but market exchange is direct: the
    Usiai are viewed as furtive and hostile, “whose eye is ever on
    driving a sharp bargain, whose trade manners are atrocious” (Mead,
    1929, p. 118; see also Mead, 1934, pp. 307–308).
-   A.2.7 Chimbu — “Mutual help and sharing characterize relations among
    subclan members. A man may call upon a fellow sub-clansman for help
    whenever he needs it; he may ask any wife or daughter of a member of
    his subclan to give him food when she has some. . . . However, it is
    only the most prominent men who can count on such services from
    persons outside their own subclan” (Brown and Brookfield,
    1959–60, p. 59; on the exception of “prominent men,” compare
    Appendix B, “Reciprocity and Kinship Rank”). The pig-exchanges and
    other exchanges between clans argue balance in the external sector
    here, as elsewhere in the New Guinea Highlands (compare, for
    example, Bulmer, 1960, pp. 9–10).
-   A.2.8 Buka Passage — The total of internal reciprocity seems limited
    by comparison with external trade, but there are some indications of
    generalized exchange in internal sectors as contrasted with
    balanced, though not haggled, external exchange. In Kurtatchi
    village, requests from own sibmates of the same sex for areca or
    coconuts are honored without repayment though the recipients are
    open to counter request; otherwise, no giving of something for
    nothing—save that near relatives may take a man’s coconuts
    (Blackwood, 1935, pp. 452, 454; compare p. 439 f on trade).
-   A.2.9 Lesu — “Free gifts” (generalized reciprocity) are especially
    rendered to relatives and friends, most especially certain types of
    kinsmen. These gifts are food and betel. Between villages and
    moieties there are various balanced transactions (Powder-maker,
    1933, pp. 195–203).
-   A.2.10 Dobu — As is well known, a very narrow sector of economic
    trust and generosity, including only susu and household. Outside of
    this, theft is a possibility. Intervillage affinal exchanges more or
    less balanced, with village mates helping the sponsoring susu meet
    its obligations (Fortune, 1932).
-   A.2.11 Trobriands — The sociology of the reciprocity continuum
    described by Malinowski is only partly sectoral; rank considerations
    (compare below) and affinal obligations notably intrude. “Pure
    gift,” however, is characteristic of family relations (Malinowski,
    1922, pp. 177–178); “customary payments, re-paid irregularly, and
    without strict equivalence” include urigubu and contributions to a
    kinsman’s mortuary-ceremony fund (p. 180); “gifts returned in
    economically equivalent form” (or almost equivalent form) include
    intervillage presentations at visits, exchanges between “friends”
    (apparently these are especially or exclusively outside the
    village), and, it seems, the “secondary” trade in strategic goods
    between kula partners (pp. 184–185); “ceremonial barter with
    deferred payment” (not haggled) is characteristic between kula
    partners and between partners in the inland-coastal, vegetables
    versus fish exchange (wasi) (pp. 187–189; cf. p. 42); “trade, pure
    and simple,” involving haggling, mainly in non-partner exchange
    between members of “industrial” and other villages within Kiriwina
    (pp. 189–190). The last type is gimwali; it is characteristic also
    of vegetable-fish exchange in the absence of partnership and
    overseas exchange accompanying kula, again in the absence of
    partnership (cf. pp. 361 f).
-   A.2.12 Tikopia — Near kinsmen and neighbors are privileged
    economically (e.g., Firth, 1936, p. 399; 1950, p. 203) and are
    expected to render economic assistance in various ways (e.g., Firth,
    1936, p. 116; 1950, p. 292). The necessity of a quid pro quo seems
    to increase with kinship distance—thus “forced exchange” (also known
    ethnographically as “coer-cive gift”) is a transaction of the more
    distant sector: “The importance of the social category comes out . .
    . in cases such as when a man wants a coconut-grating stool. If he
    knows of a close kinsman who has an extra one, he goes and asks for
    it and should get it without ceremony. ‘You give me a stool for
    myself; your stools are two.’ It is said that the kinsman ‘rejoices’
    to give it because of the tie between them. Sooner or later he in
    turn comes and asks for something he fancies and this too will be
    handed over freely. Such freedom of approach obtains only between
    members of a small kinship group and depends upon the recognition of
    a principle of reciprocity. If a man is going to apply to someone
    not of his own kin, a ‘different man’ as the Tikopia say, then he
    cooks food, fills a large basket, and tops it off with an ordinary
    piece of bark-cloth or even a blanket. Armed with this he goes to
    the owner and asks for the article. He is usually not refused”
    (Firth, 1950, p. 316).
-   A.2.13 Maori — A large part of the internal circulation, here of the
    village especially, was centralized in chiefly hands—it was
    generalized enough but run on the principles of chiefly due and
    noblesse oblige (cf. Firth, 1959). The external exchanges
    (intervillage, intertribal) involved more direct and equivalent
    reciprocation, although prestige of course accrued to liberality
    (cf. Firth, 1959, pp. 335–337, 403–409, 422–423). Maori proverb: “In
    winter a relation, in autumn a son; signifying ‘he is only a distant
    relative at the time of cultivation when there is heavy work to be
    tackled, but in the time after harvest when all is finished, and
    there is plenty of food to be eaten, he calls himself my son’ ”
    (Firth, 1926, p. 251).
-   A.3.0 Notes from here and there.
-   A.3.1 Pilaga — Henry’s well-known study (1951) of food-sharing in a
    Pilaga village is here cited with caution. We have to deal with a
    disrupted and resettled population. Also, during the period of
    Henry’s observations a great portion of the men were away working on
    sugar plantations. It was, moreover, the “hungry time” of the Pilaga
    year. “Thus we are dealing with an economic system from which a
    considerable number of productive persons had been withdrawn, and
    during a period of scarcity, with the society functioning at low
    ebb” (Henry, 1951, p. 193). (The intense food-sharing under these
    miserable conditions is consistent with propositions developed below
    on the relation between reciprocity and need.) I assume that most if
    not all the instances of sharing were of the generalized reciprocal
    sort, the giving out of larger stocks that had come to hand,
    rendering assistance and the like. The assumption is consistent with
    examples offered by Henry and with the lack of balance he records in
    individuals’ outgo and income. Trade with other groups, reported by
    Henry to have occurred, is not considered in the study in question.
    The principal value of this study for the present discussion is its
    specification of the incidence of food-sharing by social distance.
    The obligation to share food is highest among those closest in
    kinship-residential terms. “Membership in the same household [a
    multifamily and multidwelling group making up a section of the
    village] constitutes a very close tie; but membership in the same
    household plus a close kinship tie is the closest of bonds. This is
    objectified in food-sharing, those having the closest bond sharing
    food most often” (p. 188). The conclusion is supported by analysis
    of particular cases. (In one of these, the association between
    sharing and close relations was working the other way around—a woman
    was sharing food heavily with a man whom she wanted to, and
    eventually did, marry.) “The cases reviewed so far concerning
    distribution within the household [section of the village] may be
    summarized as follows: the answer to the question, to which
    individual or family did each individual or family give most often?
    can be answered only through quantitative analysis of the behavior
    of individuals and families. When this is done four points
    emerge: (1) The Pilaga distributes most of his product to members of
    his own household. (2) He does not distribute equally to all. (3) A
    variety of factors enter to prevent his distributing equally to all;
    (a) differences in genealogical ties, (b) differences of obligations
    among the people of the household with respect to their obligations
    outside it, (c) stability of residence, (d) dependency needs, (e)
    marital expectations, (f) fear of shamans, and (g) special food
    taboos. (4) When common residence and close genealogical ties
    combine, the highest rate of interchange of products between
    families so related is present” (p. 207). The sectoral incidence of
    food-sharing is shown in the following chart (adapted from Henry’s
    Table IV, p. 210).The other section of the village, for which Henry
    did not have as numerous records—because they were wandering about
    the forest a good deal—does not show the same trend (also Table IV).
    The second column is in three of four instances larger than the
    first—more sharing across the village than within the “household”
    section. But this section of the village is not comparable to the
    other (tabulated above) because in the former people were “more
    closely integrated [i.e. closely related] than those at the other
    end, thus much of what takes the form of distribution, the transfer
    of produce from the producer to another person, in No. 28’s part of
    the village [tabulated below], takes the form of commensality at No.
    14’s end of the village. Hence the percentage of product distributed
    by No. 14’s people to persons within the section . . . appears low,
    while that distributed to other classes [sectors] seems high” (p.
    211; Henry’s emphases). Since Henry does not consider commensality
    among different families of the same “household” as food-sharing,
    the seeming exception may be in fairness disregarded.

-   A.3.2 Nuer — Intensive food-sharing, hospitality, and other
    generalized reciprocities in Nuer smaller local groups (hamlet
    sections of the village) and cattle camps (Evans-Pritchard, 1940,
    pp. 21, 84–85, 91, 183; 1951, pp. 2, 131–132; Howell, 1954, p. 201).
    Not much exchange in the intratribal (extra-village) sector except
    the instrumental transactions of bride-wealth and feud settlement
    (as compensations, of their nature balanced). Nuer specifically
    distinguish internal reciprocity from trade with Arabs by the
    directness (temporally) of the latter exchange (Evans-Pritchard,
    1956, p. 223 f). Relations with neighboring tribes, especially
    Dinka, notoriously appropriative, amounting in the main to seizure
    of loot and territory through violence.
-   A.3.3 Bantu of North Kavirondo — Intensive informal hospitality
    among neighbors. Exchanges of balanced sort are principally in
    durables, with craftsmen, but the rates most favor
    neighbor-clansmen, are higher for the clansman who is not a
    neighbor, and most dear for strangers (Wagner, 1956, pp. 161–162).
-   A.3.4 Chukchee — Certain amount of generosity and assistance within
    Chukchee camps (see citations in Sahlins, 1960). Theft from the
    herds of other camps is common (Bogoras, 1904–09, p. 49). Aboriginal
    trade between maritime and reindeer Chukchee, and some trade across
    the Bering Straits: apparently the trade more or less balanced; some
    of it was silent and all of it conducted with considerable mistrust
    (Bogoras, 1904–09, pp. 53, 95–96).
-   A.3.5 Tiv — Clear differentiation at least between external
    (“mar-ket”) and internal spheres. A “market” distinguishable from
    the several varieties of gift: the last imply “a relationship
    between the two parties concerned which is of a permanence and
    warmth not known in a ‘market,’ and hence—though gifts should be
    reciprocal over a long period of time—it is bad form overtly to
    count and compete and haggle over gifts” (Bohannan, 1955, p. 60). A
    “market” is competitive and exploitative: “In fact, the presence of
    a previous relationship makes a ‘good market’ impossible: people do
    not like to sell to kinsmen since it is bad form to demand as high a
    price from kinsmen as one might from a stranger” (p. 60).
-   A.3.6 Bemba — A centralized system of reciprocities (chiefly
    redistribution) is, analogously to Polynesia, the main part of the
    larger economy; a very limited intertribal exchange sector
    (Richards, 1939, p. 221 f). Various dues to close relatives by kin
    type (pp. 188 f). Apart from hospitality to visiting kinsmen, chiefs
    and, nowadays, strangers, food-sharing is ordinarily characteristic
    in a narrow circle of close kin—but apparently in a wider circle
    during scarcities (pp. 108–109, 136 f, 178–182, 186, 202–203). The
    money that has been introduced is not much used in internal
    exchange, but when it is, “People buying from relatives pay less
    than the normal rate, and usually add some service to the
    transaction” (p. 220). “. . . I have often seen women take a pot of
    beer and conceal it in a friend’s granary on the reported arrival of
    some elderly relative. To refuse hospitality with a pot of beer
    sitting on the hearth would be an impossible insult, but a bland
    assertion that ‘Alas, Sir, we poor wretches. . . . We have nothing
    to eat here’ is sometimes necessary. This would not be done in the
    case of a near relative, but only with a more distant kinsman of a
    classificatory type, or one of the well-known ‘cadgers’ of a family”
    (p. 202).

    headman] went further than most in avoiding prominence; he had
    almost no possessions and gave away everything that came into his
    hands. He was diplomatic, for in exchange for his self-imposed
    poverty he won the respect and following of all the people there”
    (Thomas, 1959, p. 183). “We did hear people say . . . that a headman
    may feel that he should lean well to the generous side in his
    giving, for his position as headman sets him out from the others a
    little and he wants whatever attention this attracts not to be
    envious. Someone remarked that this could keep a headman poor”
    (Marshall, 1961, p. 244).
-   B.1.2 Andamans — “Generosity is esteemed by the Andaman Islanders as
    one of the highest of virtues and is unremittingly practiced by the
    majority of them,” Radcliffe-Brown writes (1948, p. 43). He notes
    that the person who does not work and must needs be given food sinks
    in esteem, while Man remarked that the generous person rises in
    esteem (Man, n.d., p. 41). There is a definite generation-status
    influence on reciprocity. Although at least sometimes appearing as
    givers of food—on occasions of collective sharing of game—elders are
    privileged in regard to juniors: “It is considered a breach of good
    manners ever to refuse the request of another. Thus if a man be
    asked by another to give him anything that he may possess, he will
    immediately do so. If the two men are equals a return of about the
    same value will have to be made. As between an older married man and
    a bachelor or a young married man, however, the younger would not
    make any request of such a nature, and if the older asked the
    younger for anything, the latter would give it without always
    expecting a return” (Radcliffe-Brown, 1948, pp. 42–43).
-   B.1.3 Eskimo — Influence and prestige accrued to the North Alaskan
    Eskimo whale boat leader or caribou hunting leader at least in part
    by virtue of the stuff he doled out in ostensibly generous fashion
    (Spencer, 1959, pp. 144, 152 f, 210 f, 335–336, 351). Great men
    noted for their great generosity (pp. 154–155, 157). Stinginess as
    usual deplorable (p. 164).
-   B.1.4 Carrier — A big-man, slighted by a fur trader, boasts that he
    is just as good a chief as the trader: “ ‘When it is the proper
    season to hunt the beaver, I kill them; and of their flesh I make
    feasts for my relations. I, often, feast all the Indians of my
    village; and, sometimes, invite people from afar off, to come and
    partake of the fruits of my hunts . . . ’ ” (Harmon, 1957, pp.
    143–144; cf. pp. 253–254).
-   B.2.0 Melanesia — I have elsewhere presented a general study of the
    economics of big-man leadership in western Melanesian societies
    (Sahlins, 1963). Generalized reciprocity is here the decisive
    “starting mechanism” of ranking. A following is developed through
    private assistance to individuals, a tribal name (renown) through
    large-scale giveaways, often of pigs and vegetable foods. The
    wherewithal for his generosity comes initially from the aspiring
    big-man’s own household from his nearest relatives: he capitalizes
    in the beginning on kinship dues and by finessing the generalized
    reciprocity appropriate among close kin. He often enlarges his
    household at an early phase, perhaps by taking additional wives. A
    leader’s career is well under way when he is able to link other men
    and their families to his faction, to harness their production to
    his ambition by helping them in some big way. He cannot, however,
    extend these people too far: some material benefits must accrue to
    followers on pain of encouraging their discontent and his downfall.

    Most examples that follow are of big-man systems. The concluding
    cases are different: chiefdoms or protochiefdoms in which
    generalized reciprocity between ranks is apparent in a
    redistributive context.

-   

    B.2.1 Siuai — The most thorough exposition of Melanesian big-man
    economics is Oliver’s (1955) study. The development of influence and
    prestige through generalized transactions is richly described. There
    are several peripheral features likewise of interest in the present
    context. Notable is the influence of rank on customary rates of
    balance in shell money dealings: “One great advantage of being a
    leader lies in one’s ability to buy things more cheaply (‘When a
    mumi [big-man] sends out thirty spans of mauai to purchase a pig for
    a feast, the pig owner would be ashamed to send along a pig worth
    less than forty’). On the other hand, this commercial advantage of
    the leader is usually counterbalanced by the traditional exercise of
    noblesse oblige” (p. 342). So, “the most praiseworthy thing a man
    can do is to exceed the transactional requirements of ordinary trade
    and kin relationships by paying generously (in goods) for all goods
    and services he receives, by giving goods to persons to whom he is
    not directly obligated, and by doing these things after the manner
    of great leaders of the past” (p. 456; cf. pp. 378, 407, 429–430).

    Thurnwald writes of another Buin Plain people that mamoko, the
    reward given by a big-man to his followers, “is considered an act of
    liberality, for which there is no obligation. Any gift of friendship
    is described by the same name. A surplus payment over the price
    agreed is also called mamoko. Totokai is the excess payment of a
    kitere [follower] to his mumira [leader] for ensuring his good will
    and his willingness to credit him with abuta [shell money] on
    another occasion. Dakai designates a payment for reconciliation or
    reparation between men of equal position” (Thurnwald, 1934–35, p.
    135). The variation of reciprocity by rank difference is clear.

-   B.2.2 ’Gawa (Busama) — Clubhouse leaders and, especially,
    outstanding village leaders are typical western Melanesian big-men.
    Hogbin writes: “The man who is generous over a long period thus has
    many persons in his debt. No problem arises when these are of the
    same status as himself— the poor give one another insignificant
    presents, and the rich exchange sumptuous offerings. But if his
    resources are greater than theirs they may find repayment impossible
    and have to default. Acutely conscious of their position, they
    express their humility in terms of deference and respect. . . . The
    relation of debtors and creditors forms the basis of the system of
    leadership” (Hogbin, 1951, p. 122). The leaders were “men who ate
    bones and chewed lime—they presented the best meat to others,
    leaving only scraps for themselves, and were so free with areca nuts
    and pepper that they had no betel mixture left. Folk-tales about
    legendary headmen of the past relate that, although these men had
    ‘more pigs than anyone could count and bigger gardens than are made
    now,’ they gave everything away” (p. 123; cf. pp. 118 f). The main
    run of clubhouse leaders were reluctantly placed in that position.
    The work was hard— “His hands are never free from earth, and his
    forehead continually drips with sweat” (p. 131)—and the material
    rewards nil. The principal big-man of the village, however, was
    ambitious. “It is frequently insisted that the headmen were so
    jealous of their reputation that they went to the trouble of
    inventing excuses for giving food away” (p. 139). Low rank was the
    reward of stinginess, and he who is prepared to take advantage of
    others, “He sinks to the bottom of the social ladder. . . . ” (p.
    126).
-   B.2.3 Kaoka (Guadalcanal) — A main-run big-man economy (Hog-bin,
    1933–34; 1937–38). “Reputation . . . is enhanced not by accumulating
    wealth in order to use it for one’s self but by giving it away.
    Every event of importance in a person’s life— marriage, birth, death
    and even the construction of a new house or canoe—is celebrated by a
    feast, and the more feasts a man gives, and the more lavish he is in
    providing food, the greater is his prestige. The social leaders are
    those who give away most” (Hogbin, 1937–38, p. 290).
-   B.2.4 Kapauku — Described by the ethnographer as sort of upland New
    Guinea capitalists. The big-man pattern, however, is an ordinary
    (sweet potato) garden variety. “Loans” and “credit” put out by
    Kapauku big-men (tonowi, generous richman) are not interest bearing
    in the standard sense (see above, A. 2.4); they are means of
    developing status through generosity (Pospisil, 1958, p. 129). “The
    society views its ideal man as a most generous individual, who
    through the distribution of his fortune satisfies the needs of many
    people. Generosity is the highest cultural value and an attribute
    necessary for acquiring followers in political and legal life” (p.
    57). The big-man’s status sinks if he loses the wherewithal for
    generosity (p. 59); if he is excessively demanding he is likely to
    face an egalitarian rebellion— “ ‘. . you should not be the only
    rich man, we should all be the same, therefore you only stay equal
    with us’. . . was the reason given by the Paniai people for killing
    Mote Juwopija of Madi, a tonowi who was not generous enough” (p. 80;
    cf. pp. 108–110). Wealth is not enough: “. . . a selfish individual
    who hoards his money and does not lend [sic] it, never sees the time
    when his word will be taken seriously and his advice and decisions
    followed, no matter how rich he may become. The people believe that
    the only justification for becoming rich is to be able to
    redistribute the accumulated property among one’s less fortunate
    fellows, a procedure which also gains their support” (pp. 79–80).
    Big-men buy more cheaply than prevailing rates (p. 122). One big-man
    summed up well, if cynically, the rank-generating impetus delivered
    by generalized reciprocity. “ ‘I am a headman,’ he said, ‘not
    because the people like me but because they owe me money and are
    afraid’ ” (p. 95).
-   B.2.5 New Guinea Highlands — The big-man pattern, here worked out in
    a segmented lineage context, is general in the Highlands. “The Kuma
    ‘big men’ or ‘men of strength’ . . . who can command much wealth,
    are entrepreneurs in the sense that they control the flow of
    valuables between clans by making fresh presentations on their own
    account and choosing whether or not to contribute to others. Their
    profit in these transactions is incremental reputation. . . . The
    aim is not simply to be wealthy, nor even to act as only the wealthy
    can act: it is to be known to be wealthy. Further, a man does not
    really achieve his ambition until he can be seen to act as if wealth
    itself were of no account” (Reay, 1959, p. 96; see pp. 110–111,
    130). There is also the usual Melanesian corollary of the big-man,
    the “rubbish man.” “A man is a ‘rubbish man’ of no consequence if he
    has not enough food to offer many friends and relatives as well as
    meet his personal requirements” (p. 23).

    The use of generalized reciprocity as a mechanism of status
    differentiation in another Highland instance (Kyaka) is succinctly
    put by Bulmer: “These supporters of a leader are normally in a state
    of mutual obligation with him, having been helped by him with
    bridewealth payment and the like, or expecting help of this kind.
    Such assistance obligates them to channel through him such pigs of
    their own as they are putting into the Moka [interclan
    pig-exchange]” (Bulmer, 1960, p. 9).

-   B.2.6 Lesu — “A rich man might pay five tsera for a pig for which
    another man would pay four. The more he pays the more prestige the
    buyer has. Everyone then knows he is a rich man. On the other hand,
    the owner of a pig would gain prestige if he sold it for four tsera
    when he might have received five” (Pow-dermaker, 1933, p. 201).
-   B.2.7 To’ambaita (N. Malaita) — Another good description of a
    typical big-man order, conforming in all essential respects to those
    already discussed (Hogbin, 1939, pp. 61 f; 1943–44, pp. 258 f).
-   B.2.8 Manus — The Manus have—or had, in their “old lives”—a big-man
    pattern (Mead, 1934; 1937a). Their clans, however, were also
    ascriptively divided into two ranks, lapan (high) and lau (low).
    This ranking was, according to Mead, not of great political
    significance, but its economic side is of interest nonetheless.
    “Between lapan and lau there is a type of mutual helpfulness
    expected, not unlike a slight version of the feudal relationship—the
    lapan takes care of the economic needs of the lau and the lau works
    for the lapan” (Mead, 1934, pp. 335–336).

    For discussion of other big-men systems see Sahlins, 1963. Among the
    well-described ones are the Arapesh (Mead, 1937a; 1938; 1947), the
    Abelam (Kaberry, 1940–41; 1941–42), and Tangu (Burridge, 1960).
    Deacon struck the general note: “Yet for all that the Malekulan is,
    as has been said, grasping and bourgeois in his attitude toward
    wealth, generosity and consideration for one’s debtors are held up
    as virtues. . . . To be stingy is to sink in public esteem; to be
    openhanded is to acquire fame, honour, and influence” (Deacon,
    1934, p. 200).

-   B.2.9 Sa’a — The generalized reciprocity principle in the context of
    a small scale redistributive system. “The good chief and the
    commoners regarded one another as mutually dependent on each other,
    and the people loved a chief who by his feasts brought glory on the
    place, and one of the reasons why [the chief] Wate’ou’ou was called.
    . . ‘he who keeps the canoe on a straight course,’ was because he
    was good at feasts” (Ivens, 1927, p. 255). “Stowed away safely in
    the lodge in bags is the chief’s possession in money, which in a
    measure is what Doraadi called the ‘panga,’ the ‘bank’ of the
    village because it is drawn on for communal purposes such as feasts
    or the payments of blood money. The Sa’a chiefs were wealthy men
    owing to the contributions made to them on public occasions by the
    commoners” (p. 32). “Chief and priest were exempted from the
    obligation to make a return for gifts received which held always in
    the case of commoners” (p. 8). “Chiefs were said to kuluhie hänue,
    succour the land, to draw the people up who came to them for
    protection, and the word kulu, draw or lift up, appears in the
    compound mänikulu’e, glorious, a word associated with feasts and
    chiefs” (p. 129, cf. pp. 145, 147– 148, 160 f, 221 f).
-   B.2.10 Trobriands — Generalized rank reciprocity organized as
    redistribution. The underlying ethic was reciprocal assistance
    between chiefs and people. Malinowski’s many statements of the
    economic obligations of chieftainship include several which
    highlight the status implications of generosity. For example: “. . .
    to possess is to be great, and . . . wealth is the indispensable
    appanage of social rank and attribute of personal virtue. But the
    important point is that with them to possess is to give. . . . A man
    who owns a thing is naturally expected to share it, to distribute
    it, to be its trustee and dispenser. And the higher the rank the
    greater the obligation. . . . Thus the main symptom of being
    powerful is to be wealthy, and of wealth is to be generous.
    Meanness, indeed, is the most despised vice, and the only thing
    about which the natives have strong moral views, while generosity is
    the essence of goodness” (1922, p. 97). Again: “Not in all cases,
    but in many of them, the handing over of wealth is the expression of
    the superiority of the giver over the recipient. In others, it
    represents subordination to a chief, or a kinship relation or
    relationship-in-law” (p. 175). “Relationship between Chiefs and
    Commoners.—The tributes and services given to a chief by his vassals
    on the one hand, and the small but frequent gifts which he gives
    them, and the big and important contribution which he makes to all
    tribal enterprises are characteristic of this relationship” (p.
    193). The Trobriand chief’s difficulties in holding on to his betel,
    and the little strategems he employed to save some for himself, are
    famous anecdotes of the introductory anthropology course
    (Malinowski, 1922, p. 97).
-   B.3.0 American Plains — Plains Indian chiefs were local equivalents
    of Melanesian big-men. The pattern is much the same; the cultural
    idiom varies. Generalized reciprocity here again a decisive starting
    mechanism of leadership. Military honors were an important attribute
    of leaders, but influence rested as much or more on generous
    dispositions of horses, of loot, of meat, of help to the poor and
    widowed, and the like. The chief’s faction was a roving band, a
    cluster of lesser and often dependent people, for whose well-being
    the chief felt responsible and upon whom he might draw economically.
    Wealth in horses was an ultimate necessity for a band chief: the
    loss of this fund of generosity was the loss of influence.
-   B.3.1 Assiniboin — “The chief of a band is little more than the
    nominal father of all and addresses them as his children in a body”
    (Denig, 1928–29, p. 431). “A chief must give away all to preserve
    his popularity and is always the poorest in the band, yet he takes
    good care to distribute his gifts among his own relatives or the
    rich, upon whom he can draw at any time he be in need” (p. 449; cf.
    pp. 432, 525, 547–548, 563; on the element of calculation in
    Assiniboin generosity, see pp. 475, 514–515).
-   B.3.2 Kansa-Osage — “The chiefs and candidates for public preferment
    render themselves popular by their disinterestedness and poverty.
    Whenever any extraordinary success attends them in the acquisition
    of property, it is only for the benefit of their meritorious
    adherents, for they distribute it with a profuse liberality, and
    pride themselves in being esteemed the poorest man in the community”
    (Hunter, 1823, p. 317).
-   B.3.3 Plains Cree — “It is not an easy thing to be a chief. Look at
    this chief now. He has to have pity on the poor. When he sees a man
    in difficulty he must try to help him in whatever way he can. If a
    person asks for something in his tipi, he must give it to him
    willingly and without bad feeling” (Mandelbaum, 1940, p. 222; cf.
    pp. 195, 205, 221 f, 270–271).
-   B.3.4 Blackfoot — The same pattern, in essence (Ewers, 1955, pp.
    140–141, 161 f, 188–189, 192–193, 240 f).
-   B.3.5 Comanche — The same (Wallace and Hoebel, 1952, pp. 36, 131,
    209 f, 240).
-   B.4.0 Polynesia — I have elsewhere offered studies of the economies
    of Polynesian chieftainship (Sahlins, 1958; 1963). Redistribution is
    the transactional form, generalized reciprocity the principle. The
    few notes here highlight particularly the principle.
-   B.4.1 Maori — Firth’s excellent analysis of Maori economics provides
    the mise en scène for considerations of rank reciprocity in
    Polynesia. I cite two long passages: “The prestige of a chief was
    bound up with his free use of wealth, particularly food. This in
    turn tended to secure for him a larger revenue from which to display
    his hospitality, since his followers and relatives brought him
    choice gifts. . . . Apart from lavish entertainment of strangers and
    visitors, the chief also disbursed wealth freely as presents among
    his followers. By this means their allegiance was secured and he
    repaid them for the gifts and personal services rendered to him. All
    payment among the Maori was made in the form of gifts. There was
    thus a continual reciprocity between chief and people. The chief
    also acted as a kind of capitalist, assuming the initiative in the
    construction of certain ‘public works’ if the term may be so used.
    It was by his accumulation and possession of wealth, and his
    subsequent lavish distribution of it, that such a man was able to
    give the spur to these important tribal enterprises. He was a kind
    of channel through which wealth flowed, concentrating it only to
    pour it out freely again” (Firth, 1959a, p. 133). “The quantity and
    quality of. . . gifts received tended to increase with the rank and
    hereditary position of the chief in the tribe, his prestige, and the
    following which he was able to gather around him. But the
    relationship was by no means one-sided. If the income of a chief was
    largely dependent on his prestige and influence and the regard of
    his people, this in its turn was contingent upon his liberal
    treatment of them. There were constant calls upon his resources. His
    slaves and immediate dependents had to be fed, he was expected to
    assist those of his tribesmen who came to him in need, a crowd of
    relatives—and the Maori bonds of kinship stretched far—looked to him
    for a generous repayment of all the small social services they
    rendered him, and for an occasional douceur as a mark of
    appreciation of their loyalty. When presents of foodstuffs were made
    to him by people of other tribes his regard for his reputation
    required that he should distribute a considerable portion of them
    among his tribespeople. For all gifts made to him a return was
    expected, of equivalent or even greater value. . . . Again, the
    calls of hospitality were never ending. Entertainment had to be
    provided on a lavish scale for visiting chiefs and their adherents.
    . . . Moreover, on occasions of the birth, marriage or death of any
    people of rank in the village his personal resources were drawn upon
    to a serious extent, while the occasional provision of a large feast
    also drained him of food supplies. In this connection he seems to
    have exercised control of the communal stores of food which he
    commanded to be disbursed as required. If the chief’s use of wealth
    be reviewed, then, it is seen that to the varied sources which
    provided him with his stores of goods corresponded a number of
    serious liabilities. The result was that a sort of equilibrium was
    maintained between income and expenditure. In general, at no time
    was the chief the possessor of enormous quantities of valuables,
    though the system of receipt and redistribution of goods allowed a
    great quantity of them to flow through his hands” (pp. 297–298; cf.
    pp. 130 f, 164, 294 f, 345–346).
-   B.4.2 Hawaii — Chiefs had extensive call on the labor, the resources
    and products of the underlying (makaainana) population, as well as
    control over certain specialists and enjoyment of certain sumptuary
    perquisites. The chiefdom, often embracing the whole of a large
    island, was an elaborate collection-redistribution apparatus. “It
    was the practice for kings [i.e. paramount chiefs of individual
    islands] to build storehouses in which to collect food, fish, tapas
    [bark cloth], malos [men’s loin cloths], pa-us [women’s loin
    skirts], and all sorts of goods. These store-houses were designed by
    the Kalaimoku [chief’s executive] as a means of keeping the people
    contented, so they would not desert the king. They were like the
    baskets that were used to entrap the hinalea fish. The hinalea
    thought there was something good within the basket, and he hung
    round the outside of it. In the same way the people thought there
    was food in the storehouses, and they kept their eyes on the king.
    As the rat will not desert the pantry . . . where he thinks food is,
    so the people will not desert the king while they think there is
    food in his storehouse” (Malo, 1951, p. 195). The tendency at the
    highest levels of chieftainship, however—and despite well meaning
    advice of counselors—was to press too heavily on the lesser chiefs
    and people, with the result that, as Malo puts it, “Many kings were
    put to death by the people because of their oppression of the
    makaainana [commonality]” (p. 195; cf. pp. 58, 61; Fornander, 1880:
    pp. 76, 88, 100–101, 200–202, 227–228, 270–271).
-   

    B.4.3 Tonga — A fine native statement of the chiefly economic ethic,
    attributed by Mariner to the chief Finau. Upon Mariner’s explanation
    of the value of money: “Finow replied that the explanation did not
    satisfy him; he still thought it a foolish thing that people should
    place a value on money, when they either could not or would not
    apply it to any useful (physical) purpose. ‘If,’ said he, ‘it were
    made of iron, and could be converted into knives, axes and chisels,
    there would be some sense in placing a value on it; but as it is, I
    see none. If a man,’ he added, ‘has more yams than he wants, let him
    exchange some of them away for pork or gnatoo [bark cloth].
    Certainly money is much handier, and more convenient, but then, as
    it will not spoil by being kept, people will store it up, instead of
    sharing it out, as a chief ought to do, and thus become selfish;
    whereas, if provisions were the principal property of man, and it
    ought to be, as being both the most useful and the most necessary,
    he could not store it up, for it would spoil, and so he would be
    obliged either to exchange it away for something else useful, or
    share it to his neighbors, and inferior chiefs and dependents, for
    nothing.’ He concluded by saying ‘I understand now very well what it
    is that makes the Papalangis [“Europeans”] so selfish—it is this
    money!” ’ (Mariner, 1827 i, pp. 213–214).

    Conversely, the upward flow: “. . . the practice of making presents
    to superior chiefs is very general and frequent. The higher class of
    chiefs generally make a present to the king, of hogs or yams about
    once a fortnight. These chiefs, about the same time, receive
    presents from those below them, and these last from others, and so
    on, down to the common people” (p. 210; cf. Gifford, 1929).

-   B.4.4 Tahiti — From indications of the Duff missionaries, it looks
    as if Ha’amanimani, the Tahitian priest-chief, acted faithfully to
    the ideal expressed by Finau: “Manne Manne was very urgent for
    sails, rope, anchor, etc. for his vessel, none of which articles we
    had to spare: on which account, though the captain gave him his own
    cocked hat and a variety of articles, he was still discontented;
    saying, ‘Several people told me that you wanted Manne Manne, and now
    I am come, you give me nothing.’ An observation similar to this he
    once made to the missionaries: ‘You give me,’ says he, ‘much parow
    (talk) and much prayers to the Eatora, but very few axes, knives,
    scis-sars, or cloth.’ The case is, that whatever he receives he
    immediately distributes among his friends and dependents; so that
    for all the numerous presents he had received, he had nothing now to
    shew, except a glazed hat, a pair of breeches, and an old black
    coat, which he had fringed with red feathers. And this prodigal
    behavior he excuses, by saying that, were he not to do so, he should
    never be a king, nor even remain a chief of any consequence” (Duff
    missionaries, 1799, pp. 224–225). For all this it is apparent from
    the Duff journal as well as other early reports (e.g.,
    Rodriguez, 1919) that Tahitian high chiefs might accumulate
    considerable stocks of goods and especially that they had very
    considerable power to demand foodstuffs from the underlying
    population. The traditional counsel was the same as in Hawaii—“Your
    household must not be accused of food hiding. Let not your name be
    associated with hidden foods or hidden goods. The hands of the Arii
    must be always open; on these two things rest your prestige” (Handy,
    1930, p. 41)—but apparently Tahitian chiefs were inclined, as it is
    said, to “eat the powers of the government too much.” (Yet see also
    Davies, 1961, p. 87 note 1).
-   B.4.5 Tikopia — A stream of gifts flow from below to the Tikopia
    chief, but then his obligation to be generous is at least as great
    as his ability to accumulate things. Generosity indeed was a
    jealousy guarded chiefly prerogative: “Chiefs are recognized as
    being proper persons to control large quantities of food, to have a
    number of valued objects stored away in their houses. . . . But the
    stocks which they accumulate are expected to be dispersed in a
    manner which will yield benefit to their people. Great accumulation
    by a commoner must also be followed by a corresponding dispersal.
    But such a man would incur the charge from the chiefly families of
    fia pasak ‘desiring to boast,’ and would be watched by them lest he
    attempt to usurp some of their privileges. According to precedent in
    Tikopia history they would probably take an opportunity either to
    seize his goods or to kill him” (Firth, 1950, p. 243). The Tikopia
    chiefs, in short, would not tolerate starting mechanisms. This is
    not true throughout Polynesia. In the Marquesas, for example, upward
    mobility through “accu-mulating and dispensing wealth” was possible
    (Linton, 1938, pp. 150,153, 156–157; Handy, 1923, pp. 36–37,48, 53).
    (On other aspects of the reciprocity between Tikopia chiefs and
    people see Firth, 1936, pp. 382–383, 401–403; 1950, pp. 34, 58, 109
    f, 172, 188, 190, 191, 196, 212 f, 321).
-   B.5.0 Miscellaneous
-   B.5.1 Northwestern North America — Generalized reciprocity permeated
    the political economy of the Northwest Coast Indians, both in the
    potlatch giveaways between chiefs and in the internal relation of
    chiefs and their respective followers. The Nootka are a clearly
    described case in point. Chiefs acquired a variety of dues: from the
    first catch of salmon traps, early pickings of berry patches, from
    large catches of fish taken by their people, and the like (e.g.,
    Drucker, 1951, pp. 56–57, 172, 255, 272, et passim). Conversely,
    “Every time a chief got a lot of food of any kind, he gave a feast
    to give it away to his people” (p. 370; see also Suttles, 1960, pp.
    299–300; Barnett, 1938; Codere, n.d.).

    The Tolowa-Tututni political economy is the same in principle as
    that prevailing to the north, albeit a slighter version. Drucker
    characterizes the chief-follower relation as “symbiotic”—“The
    relationship uniting the rich-man and his kinfolk was essentially a
    symbiotic one. It is said that some of the richest men never worked;
    their henchmen hunted and fished for them. In return the rich-man
    gave feasts, and in lean times would share his stores with his
    people. He bought wives for the young men, or at least contributed
    most of the payment; but it was also he who accepted and held the
    bride prices paid for their sisters and daughters. Perhaps most
    important of all; it was the rich-man who was obliged to pay
    compensation for wrongs his henchmen committed, to save them, and
    himself, from retaliation . . . he received a lion’s share of any
    indemnities paid for injuries to one of them” (Drucker, 1937, p.
    245; for indications of similar rank reciprocity in California see
    Kroe-ber, 1925, pp. 3, 40, 42, 55; Goldschmidt, 1951, pp. 324–325,
    365, 413; Loeb, 1926, pp. 238–239).

-   B.5.2 Creek — One of the finest descriptions of chiefly
    redistribution, again run on the underlying principle of generalized
    reciprocity, appears in W. Bartram’s late eighteenth-century account
    of the Creek: “After the feast of the busk is over, and all the
    grain is ripe, the whole town again assemble, and every man carries
    of the fruits of his labour, from the part [of the town field] first
    allotted to him, which he deposits in his own granary; which is
    individually his own. But previous to their carrying off their crops
    from the field, there is a large crib or granary, erected in the
    plantation, which is called the king’s crib; and to this each family
    carries and deposits a certain quantity, according to his
    [apparently meaning “their”] ability or inclination, or none at all
    if he so chooses, this in appearance seems a tribute or revenue to
    the mico [chief], but in fact is designed for another purpose, i.e.
    that of a public treasury, supplied by a few and voluntary
    contributions, and to which every citizen has the right of free and
    equal access, when his own private stores are consumed, to serve as
    a surplus to fly to for succour, to assist neighboring towns whose
    crops have failed, accommodate strangers, or travellers, afford
    provisions or supplies, when they go forth on hostile expeditions,
    and for all other exigencies of the state; and this treasure is at
    the disposal of the king or mico; which is surely a royal attribute
    to have an exclusive right and ability in a community to distribute
    comfort and blessings to the necessitous” (Bartram, 1958, p. 326;
    cf. Swanton, 1928, pp. 277–278).
-   B.5.3 Kachin — “In theory then people of superior class receive
    gifts from their inferiors. But no permanent economic advantage
    accrues from this. Anyone who receives a gift is thereby placed in
    debt (hka) to the giver. . . . Paradoxically therefore although an
    individual of high-class status is defined as one who receives gifts
    . . . he is all the time under a social compulsion to give away more
    than he receives. Otherwise he would be reckoned mean and a mean man
    runs the danger of losing status” (Leach, 1954, p. 163).
-   B.5.4 Bemba — Exhibits classic redistributive economy, a classic
    generalized reciprocity between chief and people. “. . . the
    distribution of cooked food is an attribute of authority, and
    therefore prestige, and . . . its reception puts a man under an
    obligation to return to the giver respect, service, or reciprocal
    hospitality” (Richards, 1939, p. 135). The paramount is most engaged
    in the distributive process, and this “is of course necessary to the
    chief if he is to make gardens and conduct tribal business through
    his councillors. But it is more than this. The giving of food, as in
    most African tribes, is an absolutely essential attribute of
    chieftainship, just as it is of authority in the village or
    household, and the successful organization of supplies at the
    capital seems to be associated in the Bemba mind with the security
    and well-being of the whole tribe itself. . . . The whole
    institution of the kamitembo [the sacred kitchen and storehouse of
    the tribe] illustrates to my mind that close association between
    authority and the power to distribute provisions on which the tribal
    organization depends. The chief owns the food and receives tribute,
    and the chief provides for his subjects and distributes cooked food
    to them. Both of these attributes are symbolized in the kamitembo
    house” (pp. 148, 150). “I never heard a chief boast to another about
    the size of his granaries, but often about the amount of food
    brought to him and distributed by him. In fact chiefs particularly
    valued the fact that some of their food was brought to them and not
    grown in their gardens, for it gave them some kind of resource to
    fall back upon. The Bemba say: ‘We will shake the tree until it
    gives up its fruit,’ that is to say, we will nag the big man until
    he divides his supplies. If a chief attempted to dry meat and keep
    it for subsequent division his followers would sit and stare at it
    and talk about it until he was forced to give them some, but
    supplies brought irregularly from other villages provided constant
    fresh resources” (p. 214). “The people still definitely prefer their
    ruler to have a big granary. It gives them, I think, a sense of
    security—a feeling of certainty that there will be food at the
    capital and a knowledge that they are working for a powerful and
    successful man. . . . Besides this, a hungry man has technically the
    right to call upon his chief for help. I did not hear of this claim
    being made very often, but still, in a sense, the umulasa
    [tribute-labour] garden and umulasa granary are recognized as
    belonging to the people. A man can steal from the tribute garden of
    a chief, but not from those of his wives, and I have sometimes heard
    old natives speak with pride of ‘our’ granary, adding, ‘It was we
    who filled it to overflowing.’ Thus the commoner got by his labour
    the sense of supernatural support, a personal approach to his chief,
    food in return for his work, support in time of starvation, and . .
    . leadership in economic pursuits. The chief in return got extra
    supplies of food to distribute, the means of supporting his tribal
    council, the necessary labour for tribal undertakings such as
    road-building, and last, but not least, prestige” (p. 261; cf. pp.
    138, 169, 178–180, 194, 215, 221, 244 f, 275, 361–362).
-   B.5.5 Pilagá — Generosity is no starting mechanism, but it is a
    sustaining mechanism of rank. In Henry’s tables (1951, pp. 194,
    197, 214) it is the chief who gives more goods (and to more people)
    than anyone else. Henry comments regarding this: “It will. . . be
    observed that in no case is the contribution of his [i.e. the
    chiefs] family to any family equaled or exceeded by any other
    family. As a matter of fact, No. 28 [the chief] himself alone
    contributes on an average of 35% of the income, i.e. food received
    of each family. Thus the role of the chief and his family in Pilaga
    society is to support others. The chief and his family thus become
    the unifying factor in the village. It is this that gives meaning to
    the use of the father term for the chief and the child term for the
    members of the village. . . . The position of the chief, despite the
    ‘prestige’ it carries also entails burdens. All the people are his
    children (kokotepi) for whom he is responsible. Hence the word for
    chief, salyaranik, signifies one who is heavy” (pp. 214–215).


APPENDIX C

Notes on Reciprocity and Wealth

-   C.0.0 Reciprocity and Wealth — The following notes mostly concern
    societies already considered in other contexts. The citations
    illustrate particularly the association between wealth differences
    and generosity (generalized reciprocity). That food is the item so
    often shared is significant. Examples that indicate sharing in favor
    of need between socially distant parties—those who would ordinarily
    enter balanced exchange—especially underscore the assertions of this
    section.
-   C.1.0 Hunters and gatherers
-   C.1.1 Andamans — “It has been stated above that all food is private
    property and belongs to the man or woman who has obtained it.
    Everyone who has food is expected, however, to give to those who
    have none. . . . The result of these customs is that practically all
    the food obtained is evenly distributed through the whole camp . .
    .” (Radcliffe-Brown, 1948, p. 43).
-   C.1.2 Bushmen — “Food, whether vegetable or animal, and water are
    also private property, and belong to the person who has obtained
    them. Everyone who has food is, however, expected to give to those
    who have none. . . . The result is that practically all food
    obtained is evenly distributed through the whole camp” (Schapera,
    1930, p. 148). Compare these last two quotations! It is an extremely
    rare fortune in anthropology, and fills one with humble awe, to
    enter the presence of a great natural law. Actually, the elided
    parts of these citations indicate some difference in manner of
    distribution. An older married man among the Andamanese will share
    out food after he has reserved sufficient for his family; a younger
    man hands over the pigs to elders for distribution (see also
    Radcliffe-Brown, 1948, pp. 37–38, 41; Man, n.d., pp. 129, 143 note
    6). The one who takes game or veldkos among the Bushman does the
    sharing out, according to Schapera.

    The Andamanese who is lazy or helpless is still given food, despite
    the probability or certainty of no reciprocation (Radcliffe-Brown,
    1948, p. 50; Man, n.d., 25). A lazy hunter fares badly among the
    Bushmen; a crippled one is abandoned by all save his nearest
    relations (Thomas, 1959, pp. 157, 246; see also Marshall, 1961, on
    Bushman sharing).

-   C.1.3 Eskimo — The Alaskan seal-hunter is often solicited for meat,
    especially in lean winter months, and these requests are very rarely
    refused (Spencer, 1959, pp. 59, 148–149). “In times of food
    shortage, it was the successful hunter and his family who might go
    hungry, since in his generosity he gave away whatever he had at
    hand” (p. 164). Notable are the obligations of the fortunate toward
    nonkin in the camp: “Gener-osity was a primary virtue and no man
    could risk a miserly reputation. Thus anyone in the community,
    whether inland or coastal, could ask aid of a man of wealth and it
    was never refused. This might mean that the men of wealth would be
    obliged to support an entire group in times of stress. Here, too,
    aid was extended to non-kin” (p. 153; presumably these nonkin might
    at other times enter balanced exchanges, as in the “bidding
    game”—see A. 1.7). Lazy people take advantage of a hunter’s bounty,
    and do not necessarily reciprocate even if they have their own
    stores (pp. 164–165; see also pp. 345–351, 156–157 for giveaways in
    which poor stand to gain materially).

    Generally among Eskimo large game is “common property,” though
    smaller animals are not; yet the hunter might in any case invite
    people of the camp to a meal (Rink, 1875, p. 28 f; Birket-Smith,
    1959, p. 146; see also Boas, 1884–85, pp. 562, 574, 582; Weyer,
    1932, pp. 184–186).

    Spencer’s note of the reaction of Alaskan Eskimo to the Great
    Depression of the 1930s is of interest in the context of economic
    behavior during general shortage. “More so than in a time of
    prosperity, the community sense of in-group consciousness appears to
    have developed. Those who did engage in hunting were obliged by
    custom to share their catch—seal, walrus, caribou, or any other
    game—with the less fortunate members of the community. But while
    this factor of sharing operated between non-kin, the economic
    circumstances of the period furthered the aboriginal family system
    as a cooperative institution. Families worked together and extended
    their joint efforts to the benefit of the community at large. The
    return to the aboriginal social patterns at a time of economic
    stress appears to have lent the family system a force which it still
    possesses. As may be seen, however, the cooperative arrangement
    between non-kin in the community tends to break down with the
    addition of new wealth” (Spencer, 1959, pp. 361–362).

-   C.1.4 Australian Aboriginals — Local communities of Walbiri or of
    friendly tribes could drop in on neighboring Walbiri when in need.
    They were welcomed, even if the hosts’ supplies were limited, but
    there was some degree of balance in the economic relationship. The
    requests of hungry communities “often took the form of appeals to
    actual kinship ties and, couched in these terms, could hardly be
    refused. The suppliants, then or later, made gifts of weapons,
    hair-string, red ochre and the like to express their gratitude and,
    equally important, to rid themselves of feelings of shame or
    embarrassment” (Meg-gitt, 1962, p. 52). In lean seasons among the
    Arunta, everyone shared in available supplies, ordinary generation,
    sex, and kinship-status considerations notwithstanding (Spencer and
    Gillen, 1927 i, pp. 38–39, 490).
-   C.1.5 Luzon Negritos — Large quantities of food are shared; whenever
    a good find is made neighbors are invited to partake until it is
    eaten up (Vanoverbergh, 1925, p. 409).
-   C.1.6 Naskapi— The same (e.g., Leacock, 1954, p. 33).
-   C.1.7 Congo Pygmies — A hunter cannot very well refuse—in view of
    public opinion—to share out game in the camp (Putnam, 1953, p. 333).
    Larger animals, at least, were generally shared through extended
    family groups; vegetables were not so distributed unless some family
    had none and then others “come to their assistance” (Schebesta,
    1933, pp. 68, 125, 244).
-   C.1.8 Western Shoshoni — Essentially the same customary sharing of
    large game, and of lesser family supplies in favor of need, in the
    camp (Steward, 1938, pp. 60, 74, 231, 253; cf. also pp. 27–28 on
    helping families whose traditional pinion haunts were not bearing).
-   C.1.9 Northern Tungus (mounted hunters) — The hunting spoil, by the
    custom of nimadif, went to the clan—“in other words, the fruit of
    the hunting does not belong to the hunter, but to the clan”
    (Shirokogoroff, 1929, p. 195). There was great readiness to assist
    clansmen in need (p. 200). Reindeer were allocated to the poor of
    the clan following epizootics, with the results that families
    holding over sixty deer were not to be seen (p. 296).
-   C.1.10 Northern Chipewayan and Copper Indians — Samuel Hearne
    notices an outbreak of “disinterested friendship” among members of
    his crew as they prepare to attack some Eskimos: “Never was
    reciprocity of interest more generally regarded among a number of
    people, than it was on the present occasion by my crew, for not one
    was a moment in want of anything that another could spare; and if
    ever the spirit of disinterested friendship expanded the heart of a
    Northern Indian, it was here exhibited in the most extensive meaning
    of the word. Property of every kind that could be of general use now
    ceased to be private, and every one who had any thing that came
    under that description seemed proud of an opportunity of giving it,
    or lending it to those who had none, or were most in want of it”
    (Heame, 1958, p. 98).
-   C.2.0 Plains Indians — In many northern tribes there was
    insufficiency of good buffalo horses and unequal possession of them.
    Those without horses, however, did not suffer for food in
    consequence; the meat circulated to have-nots, in various ways. For
    example:
-   C.2.1 Assiniboin — Denig notes that in a large camp men who lacked
    horses, and the old and infirm as well, would follow the hunt,
    taking meat as they would but leaving the hide and choice parts for
    the hunter, and they got as much meat as they wanted (Denig,
    1928–29, p. 456; cf. p. 532). When food was scarce people would spy
    out lodges that were better supplied and drop in at mealtimes, as
    “No Indian eats before guests without offering them a share, even if
    it is the last portion they possess” (p. 509; cf. p. 515). The
    successful horse raider might be flattered so by old men upon his
    return from the raid that by the time he reached his lodge he
    (“frequently”) had given all the loot away (pp. 547–548).
-   C.2.2 Blackfoot — The poor in horses might borrow from the
    wealthy—the latter thus adding to the number of followers— and
    people whose herds had been depleted by misfortune were particularly
    so helped by those more fortunate (Ewers, 1954, pp. 140–141). A
    person who borrowed a horse for a chase might return to the owner
    the best of the meat taken, but this evidently was conditional upon
    the horse-owner’s own supply (pp. 161–162). If borrowing was not
    possible, the man would have to rely on the “rich” for meat and
    usually had to take the lean (pp. 162–163; but see pp. 240–241). A
    case was cited of an amputee warrior thereafter supplied with a
    lodge, horses and food by his band (p. 213). Those who captured
    horses on raids were supposed afterward to share their loot with
    less fortunate comrades, but arguments were frequent here (p. 188;
    compare with Plains Ojibway generosity before the raid, C.2.5). Note
    how wealth differences generalize exchange: in intratribal trading,
    rich men paid more dearly for things than did others; the average
    man, for example, gave two horses for a shirt and leggings, the rich
    man three to nine horses for the same thing (p. 218). A man, in
    addition, frequently gave horses to the needy “to get his name up,”
    and the poor might take advantage of the rich by giving small
    presents to the latter or simply praising them loudly in the hopes
    of a horse return (p. 255). Ewers thus summarizes the economic
    relation between rich and poor: “Gener-osity was felt to be a
    responsibility of the wealthy. They were expected to loan horses to
    the poor for hunting and moving camp, to give food to the poor, and
    to give away horses occasionally. They were expected to pay more in
    intratribal barter than were Indians who were not well to do. If the
    man of wealth had political ambitions it was particularly important
    that he be lavish with his gifts in order to gain a large number of
    followers to support his candidacy” (p. 242).

    The reaction to general shortage was heightened sharing. Lean winter
    periods were common: “Then the wealthy, who had put up extensive
    winter supplies the previous fall, had to share their food with the
    poor” (Ewers, 1955, p. 167). The rank structure of the band was also
    engaged to organize relief: hunters had to turn over their bag to
    the band chief, who had it cut up and divided equally to each
    family. When game became more plentiful, this “primitive form of
    food rationing” was discontinued and the chief stepped out of the
    central distributive role (pp. 167–168).

-   C.2.3 Plains Cree — The same inclination of those better off to
    share meat to people without horses, to give horses away on
    occasion—for which from the poor one received in return not meat but
    fealty (Mandelbaum, 1940, p. 195)—and other generosities found in
    the Plains in connection with wealth differences (pp. 204, 221, 222,
    270–271; see also Wallace and Hoebel, 1952, p. 75 et passim on the
    Comanche; Coues on the Mandan [village Indians], 1897, p. 337).
-   C.2.4 Kansa — Hunter writes that if one party to an agreed exchange
    could not meet his obligations due to ill health or bad hunting
    luck, he was not dunned, nor did friendly relations with his
    creditors cease. But one who failed of his obligations for reason of
    laziness was a bad Indian and would be abandoned by his friends—such
    types, however, were rare (Hunter, 1823, p. 295). Moreover, “. . .
    no one of respectable standing will be allowed to experience want or
    sufferings of any kind, while it is in the power of others of the
    same community to prevent it. In this respect they are extravagantly
    generous; always supplying the wants of their friends from their own
    superabundance” (p. 296).

    Generalized reciprocity apparently intensified during shortage.
    “Whenever a scarcity prevails, they reciprocally lend, or rather
    share with each other, their respective stores, till they are all
    exhausted. I speak now of those who are provident, and sustain good
    characters. When the case is otherwise, the wants of such
    individuals are regarded with comparative indifference; though their
    families share in the stock, become otherwise common from public
    exigency” (p. 258).

-   C.2.5 Plains Ojibway — Tanner and his Ojibway family, destitute,
    reach a camp of Ojibway and Ottawa; the chiefs of the camp meet to
    consider their plight and one man after another volunteers to hunt
    for Tanner’s people; Tanner’s FaBrWi is stingy to them, but her
    husband beats her for it (Tanner, 1954, pp. 30–34). In similar
    circumstances, an Ojibway lodge insisted on silver ornaments and
    other objects of value in return for giving Tanner’s family some
    meat one winter. This insistence on exchange struck Tanner as
    despicable, for his people were hungry—“I had not before met with
    such an instance among the Indians. They are commonly ready to
    divide what provisions they have with any who come to them in need”
    (p. 47; see also pp. 49, 60, 72–73, 75, 118, 119).

    During a period of epidemic and general food shortage in an Ojibway
    camp, Tanner and another hunter managed to kill a bear. “Of the
    flesh of this animal,” he wrote, “we could not eat a mouthful, but
    we took it home and distributed to every lodge an equal portion” (p.
    95). On another similar occasion, an Indian who had shot two moose
    tried to get Tanner to secretly share them, keeping the meat from
    the rest of the camp. Tanner, a better Indian than this, refused,
    went out hunting, killed four bears and distributed the meat to the
    hungry (p. 163).

    On special economic behavior of the warpath: if a man of the war
    party was short of moccasins or ammunition he took out one of that
    object and walked about the camp before a person well supplied; the
    latter ordinarily gave over the thing desired without the necessity
    of anyone speaking, or else, the leader of the party went from man
    to man taking what was needed by the person who was short (p. 129).

-   C.3.1 Nuer — See the citations in the text of this section: “Kinsmen
    must assist one another, and if one has a surplus of a good thing he
    must share it with his neighbors. Consequently no Nuer ever has a
    surplus” (Evans-Pritchard, 1940, p. 183). Generalized reciprocity is
    characteristic between haves and have-nots, especially if close kin
    and neighbors, in the compact dry season camps, and during seasons
    of generally low supplies (pp. 21, 25, 84–85, 90–92; 1951, p. 132;
    Howell, 1954, pp. 16, 185–186).
-   C.3.2 Kuikuru (upper Xingú) — The contrast between the handling of
    the major crop, manioc, and the disposition of maize is an
    instructive illustration of the relation of sharing to supplies on
    hand. Kuikuru households are in general self-sufficient; there is
    little sharing between them, especially of manioc which is produced
    with ease and in quantity. But during Carneiro’s stay, maize was
    planted by only five men of the village, and their harvest was
    divided through the community (Carneiro, 1957, p. 162).
-   C.3.3 Chukchee — Despite an anthropological reputation something to
    the contrary, the Chukchee are remarkably generous “toward everyone
    who is in need” (Bogoras, 1904–09, p. 47). This includes aliens,
    such as poor Lamut families who got sustenance from neighboring rich
    Chukchee without payment, and also starving Russian settlements in
    whose favor Chukchee have slaughtered their herds for little or no
    return (p. 47). At the annual fall slaughter, about one-third of the
    deer were given to guests, who need not make returns, especially if
    poor; neighboring camps, however, might exchange slaughtered beasts
    at this time (p. 375). At serious setbacks to herds, neighboring
    camps—these need not be related— might render assistance (p. 628).
    Tobacco is highly valued by Chukchee but is not hoarded when scarce;
    “. . . the last pipeful be divided or smoked by turns” (pp. 549, 615
    f, 624, 636–638).
-   C.3.4 California-Oregon — The Tolowa-Tututni “rich-man” was, as we
    have noted, a source of aid to his people (Drucker, 1937). Poorer
    people depended on the bounty of richer. “Food was shared by the
    provident with the improvident within the village group” (DuBois,
    1936, p. 51). Of the Yurok, Kroeber writes that food was sometimes
    sold, “but no well-to-do man was guilty of the practice” (1925, p.
    40), implying that the exchange would be generalized rather than
    balanced (selling) in this case. Similarly Kroeber remarks that
    small gifts among the Yurok were ordinarily reciprocated, as
    “Presents were clearly a rich man’s luxury” (p. 42; cf. p. 34 on the
    liberal disposition of fish by successful fishermen). Meat, fish and
    the like taken in large quantities by Patwin families went to the
    village chief for distribution to families most in need; a family,
    moreover, might demand food of fortunate neighbors (McKern, 1922, p.
    245).
-   C.3.5 Oceania — The Melanesian big-man complex, wherever it exists,
    argues the prevalence of generalized reciprocity in exchange between
    people of different fortune.

    The Duff missionaries’ description of Tahitian generosity,
    especially of richesse oblige, is probably too good to be true,
    anyhow too good to be analytically adequate: “All are friendly and
    generous, even to a fault; they hardly refuse anything to each other
    if importuned. Their presents are liberal, even to profusion.
    Poverty never makes a man contemptible; but to be affluent and
    covetous is the greatest shame and reproach. Should any man betray
    symptoms of incorrigible avariciousness and refuse to part with what
    he has in time of necessity, his neighbors would soon destroy all
    his property, and put him on a footing with the poorest, hardly
    leaving a house to cover his head. They will give the clothes from
    their back, rather than be called peere, peere, or stingy” (1799, p.
    334).

    Firth’s discussion of Maori sharing in favor of need is more
    measured: “At a time of shortage of provisions . . . persons did not
    as a rule keep to themselves the product of their labour, but shared
    it out among the other people of the village” (Firth, 1959, p. 162).
    It is as true in the forests of New Zealand as the savannahs of the
    Sudan that “Starvation or real want in one family was impossible
    while others in the village were abundantly supplied with food” (p.
    290).

    Of interest in connection with responses to general scarcity is the
    development in food-poor Polynesian atolls of reserve lands
    administered in group interests, the products of which were
    periodically pooled by communities (e.g., Beaglehole, E. and P.,
    1938; Hogbin,1934; MacGregor, 1937). The restudy of Tikopia by Firth
    and Spillius, however, provides probably the most comprehensive
    report of the reaction of a primitive society to prolonged and
    intense food shortage. The reaction proceeded far: while traffic in
    food did not develop, theft certainly did and contraction of
    foodsharing to the household sphere did too. These latter responses,
    increases in negative reciprocity and diminution of the sector of
    generalized exchange, were apparently progressive, augmenting as the
    crisis deepened. It is impossible to do justice here to Firth’s and
    Spillius’ analyses, but it is at least useful to excerpt some
    remarks from Firth’s summary of exchange behavior during the famine:
    “In general it can be said . . . that while morals degenerated under
    the strain of famine, manners remained. At the times of greatest
    food shortage the ordinary modes of serving food were kept up. . . .
    But while in matters of hospitality all the forms of etiquette
    continued to be maintained throughout the period of famine, its
    substance radically altered. No longer was food actually shared with
    visitors. Moreover, after food had been cooked it was . . .
    concealed—sometimes even locked up in a box. . . . In this
    development kinship ties were affected, though not quite in the same
    way as the more general rules of hospitality. Kin who called in were
    treated as ordinary visitors; food was not shared with them. . . .
    In many cases if food was left in a house a member of the household
    remained behind to guard it. Here, it was stated to Spillius, the
    inmates were often not so much afraid of theft by strangers but of
    the inroads of kin who normally would have been welcome to come and
    take what they pleased. In the definition of kin interests that took
    place under the stress of famine there was some atomization of the
    larger kin groups on the consumption side and a closer integration
    of the individual household group. (This normally meant elementary
    family but often included other kin.) Even at the height of the
    famine it appeared that within an elementary family full sharing of
    food continued to be the norm. The atomization tended to be most
    strong where food was most desparately short—and it must be
    remembered that supplies varied considerably in different groups,
    depending on their size and their wealth in land. But in one respect
    the strength of kin ties was manifested, in the common practice of
    pooling supplies, especially where food—though scarce— was not
    desperately short. Closely related households ‘linked ovens’ (tau
    umu) by each drawing upon its own stock of food and then sharing in
    the work of the oven and in a common meal . . . the Tikopia avoided
    where possible their general responsibility or undefined
    responsibility for kin during the famine but showed no disposition
    to reject responsibility which had been specifically defined by the
    undertaking. What the famine did was to reveal the solidarity of the
    elementary family. But it also brought out the strength of other kin
    ties personally assumed . . .” (Firth, 1959, pp. 83–84).

-   C.3.6 Bemba — High incidence of generalized reciprocity associated
    with differential food stocks, and also during general hunger
    seasons. Thus, “If a man’s crops are destroyed by some sudden
    calamity, or if he has planted insufficient for his needs, relatives
    in his own village may be able to help him by giving him baskets of
    grain or offering him a share in their meals. But if the whole
    community has been visited by the same affliction, such as a locust
    swarm or a raider elephant, the householder will move himself and
    his family to live with other kinsmen in an area where food is less
    scarce. . . . Hospitality of this sort is commonly practised in the
    hunger season, when families go all over the country ‘looking for
    porridge’. . . or ‘running from hunger’ . . . . Hence the legal
    obligations of kinship result in a particular type of food
    distribution, both within the village and the surrounding
    neighbourhood, which is not found in those modern communities in
    which a more individual domestic economy is practised” (Richards,
    1939, pp. 108– 109). “The economic conditions under which [a Bemba
    woman] lives necessitate reciprocal sharing of foodstuffs, rather
    than their accumulation, and extend the individual’s responsibility
    outside her own household. Plainly, therefore, it does not pay a
    Bemba woman to have very much more grain than her fellows. She would
    merely have to distribute it, and during the recent locust scourge
    the villagers whose gardens escaped destruction complained that they
    were not really better off than their fellows for ‘our people come
    and live with us or beg us for baskets of millet’ ” (pp. 201–202).
-   C.3.7 Pilagá — Henry’s Table 7(1951, p. 194) indicates that all
    unproductive persons in the village studied—it was, recall, a period
    of very low supplies—received food from more people than they gave
    food to. The “negative” balance of these cases—old and blind, old
    women, etc.—varies from –3 to –15 and the eight persons listed as
    unproductive make up more than half of those showing such negative
    balance. This is contrary to the general Pilaga trend: “It will be
    at once clear from the tables that the Pilaga on the whole gives to
    more people than he receives from, but that, with the unproductive
    Pilaga the situation is reversed” (pp. 195–197). The negative
    balance of unproductive people shows as well in the number of
    transactions as in the number of people given-to minus received-from
    (p. 196). In Table III, presenting the approximate ratios of food
    quantity received to food quantity given away, ten persons are
    listed as unproductive and for eight of these income exceeded
    out-go; six persons are listed as very or exceptionally productive
    and four had out-go over income, one had income over out-go and one
    had income equal to out-go (p. 201). I take these figures to mean
    that those who had food shared it out to those who had none, in the
    main.



6 EXCHANGE VALUE AND THE DIPLOMACY OF PRIMITIVE TRADE


Anthropological economics can respectably claim one theory of value on
its own, fashioned from empirical encounters in its own province of
primitive and peasant economies. Here, in many of the societies, have
been discovered “spheres of exchange” which stipulate for different
categories of goods differential standing in a moral hierarchy of virtu.
This is anything but a theory of exchange value. The diverse values put
on things depend specifically on barriers to their interchange, on the
inconvertibility of goods from different spheres; and as for the
transactions (“conveyances”) within any one sphere, no determinants of
the rates have yet been specified (cf. Firth, 1965; Bohannan and Dalton,
1962; Salisbury, 1962). So ours is a theory of value in nonexchange, or
of nonexchange value, which may be as appropriate to an economy not run
on sound business principles as it is paradoxical from a market
standpoint. Still it is plain that anthropological economics will have
to complete its theory of value with a theory of exchange value, or else
abandon the field at this juncture to the forces of business as usual:
supply, demand, and equilibrium price.

This essay constitutes a reconnaissance with a view toward defending the
terrain as anthropological territory. But it will be in every sense a
venture in “Stone Age Economics”—and rather of the earlier phase than
the later. Its intellectual weapons are the crudest choppers, capable
only of indelicate blows at the objective, and likely soon to crumble
against refactory empirical materials.¹

For the facts are difficult. True they are often disconcerting from the
orthodox vantage of supply and demand and generally remain so even if,
in the absence of price-fixing markets, one agrees to meanings of
“supply” and “demand” more relevant than the current technical
definitions (that is, the quantities that would be made available and
taken up over a series of prices). The same facts, however, are just as
perturbing to anthropological convictions, such as those that begin from
the prevalence in the primitive economies of “reciprocity,” whatever
that means. Indeed, the facts are perturbing precisely because we rarely
bother to say what it does mean, as a rate of exchange.

But then, a “reciprocity” that comprehends precise material rates is
rarely encountered. The characteristic fact of primitive exchange is
indeterminancy of the rates. In different transactions, similar goods
move against each other in different proportions—especially so in the
ensemble of ordinary transactions, the everyday gift giving and mutual
aid, and in the internal economy of kinship groups and communities. The
goods may be deemed comparable to all intents by the people involved,
and the variation in rates occur within the same general time period,
place, and set of economic conditions. In other words, the usual
stipulations of market imperfection seem not to blame.

Nor is the variability of reciprocity attributable to that supreme
imperfection, higgle-haggle, where an interconnection between different
deals is lacking and competition reduced to its ultimate term of an
oriental confrontation between buyer and seller. Although it would
account theoretically for the indeterminancy, bargaining is too marginal
a strategy in the primitive world to bear the burden of a general
explanation. To most primitive peoples it is completely unknown; among
the rest, it is mostly an episodic relation with strangers.

(If I may be allowed here an impertinent aside, in no way justified by
an impressive personal ignorance of Economics, the ready supposition of
extreme circumstances, amounting to the theoretical null or limiting
case, seems nevertheless characteristic of attempts to apply the formal
business apparatus to primitive economies: demand with the substitution
potential and elasticity of a market for food in a beleaguered city, the
supply sensitivity of a fish market in the late afternoon—not to mention
the appreciation of mother’s milk as “enterprise capital” [Goodfellow,
1939] or the tautological dispensation of failures to take the main
chance by invocation of a local preference for social over material
values. It is as if primitive peoples somehow manage to construct a
systematic economy under those theoretically marginal conditions where,
in the formal model, system fails.)

In truth, the primitive economies seem to defy systematization. It is
practically impossible to deduce standard going rates from any corpus of
transactions as ethnographically recorded (cf. Driberg, 1962, p. 94;
Harding, 1967; Pospisil, 1963; Price, 1962, p. 25; Sahlins, 1962). The
ethnographer may conclude that the people put no fixed values on their
goods. And even if a table of equivalences is elicited—by whatever
dubious means—actual exchanges often depart radically from these
standards, tending however to approximate them most in socially
peripheral dealings, as between members of different communities or
tribes, while swinging wildly up and down in a broad internal sector
where considerations of kinship distance, rank, and relative affluence
are effectively in play. This last qualification is important: the
material balance of reciprocity is subject to the social sector. Our
analysis of exchange value thus begins where the last chapter, on “the
sociology of primitive exchange,” left off.

The discussion in Chapter 5 argued at length the social organization of
material terms. To recapitulate very briefly: from one vantage, the
tribal plan presents itself as a series of concentric spheres, beginning
in the close-knit inner circles of homestead and hamlet, extending
thence to wider and more diffuse zones of regional and tribal
solidarity, to fade into the outer darkness of an intertribal arena.
This is at once a social and moral design of the tribal universe,
specifying norms of conduct for each sphere as are appropriate to the
degree of common interest. Exchange too is moral conduct and is so
regulated. Hence, reciprocity is generalized in the innermost sectors:
the return of a gift only indefinitely prescribed, the time and amount
of reciprocation left contingent on the future needs of the original
donor and abilities of the recipient; so the flow of goods may be
unbalanced, or even one-way, for a very long period. But on leaving
these internal spheres and uncertain repayments, one discovers a sector
of social relations so tenuous they can only be sustained by an exchange
at once more immediate and balanced. In the interest of a long-term
trade, and under the social protection of such devices as “trade
partnership,” this zone may even extend to intertribal relations. Beyond
the internal economy of variable reciprocity is a sphere, of greater or
less expanse, marked by some correlation between the customary and de
facto rates of equivalence. Here, then, is the area of greatest promise
to research on exchange rates.

In the same way as the origin of money has traditionally been sought in
external markets, and for many of the same reasons, the quest for a
primitive theory of value turns to exterior spheres of transaction. Not
only is balanced dealing there enjoined, but the exchange circuits of
the internal economy tend to disintegrate and combine, as the immorality
of “conversion” is rendered irrelevant by social distance. Goods that
were separated from each other inside the community are here brought
into equivalence. Attention especially should be directed to
transactions between trade friends and trade kinsmen, for these
relationships stipulate economic equity and going rates. Accordingly,
the inquiry that follows shall concentrate upon partnership trade, and,
out of practical considerations, upon a few empirical cases only, chosen
however from areas of the Pacific famous for an indigenous commerce.


Three Systems of Trade

We shall examine three areal exchange networks, constituting besides
three different structural and ecological forms: the Vitiaz Straits and
Huon Gulf systems of New Guinea, and the intertribal trade chain of
northern Queensland, Australia. In each case a certain play of
supply/demand is detectable in the rates of exchange. Yet the existence
of this supply/demand influence renders the trade even less
comprehensible than would its absence. For the kind of market
competition that alone in economic theory gives supply and demand such
power over exchange value is completely absent from the trade in
question.

The essentials of the Queensland network are exhibited in Figure 6.1
(constructed after the brief description provided by Sharp, 1952). In

[]

[Figure 6.1 Queensland Trade Chain (after Sharpy 1952)]

Figure 6.1 Queensland Trade Chain (after Sharpy 1952)

structure it is a simple chain of trade, band linked to band along a
line running approximately 400 miles south from the Cape York coast.
Each group is limited to contacts with its immediate neighbors, thus
only indirectly related to bands further along the line. The trade
itself proceeds in the form of gift exchange between elders standing as
classificatory brothers. Working out of Yir-Yoront, Sharp could give few
details of the axe-spear exchange running the length of the chain, but
the information is sufficient to document the effect of supply/demand on
the terms of transaction. This by the simple principle that if, in an
areal network, the exchange rate of a good (A) in terms of another (B)
rises in proportion to distance from the source of A, it is reasonable
to suppose that the relative value of A is increasing pari passu with
“real” costs and scarcities, that is, with declining supply, and
probably also with increasing demand. The differences in spear-axe
exchange ratios along the Queensland chain would reflect the double play
of this principle. At Yir-Yiront, near the northern source of spears, 12
of them must be given for a single axe; about 150 miles south, that much
closer to the source of axes, the rate falls to one to one; in the
extreme south the terms (apparently) become one spear for “several”
axes. A point then for supply and demand, and apparently for orthodox
Economic Theory.

The trade system of the Vitiaz Straits arrives at the same effect but by
different organizational means (Figure 6.2). Articulated from the center
by the voyages of Siassi Islanders, the Vitiaz network is but one of
several similar circles established in Melanesia under the aegis of
Fhoeneican-like middlemen. In their own areas, the Langalanga of
Malaita, the Tami Islanders, the Arawe of New Britain, the Manus of the
Admiralties and the Bilibili of New Guinea ply a similar trade. This
mercantile adaptation merits a short comment.

The trading groups are themselves marginally if centrally situated,
often perched precariously on stilt-house platforms in the middle of
some lagoon, without a mow of arable land to call their own or any other
resources save what the sea affords them—lacking even wood for their
canoes or fibers for their fishnets. Their technical means of production
and exchange are imported, let alone their main stocks in trade. Yet the
traders are typically the richest people of their area. The Siassi
occupy about one three-hundredths of the land in the Umboi subdistrict
(which includes the large island of that name), but they make up
approximately one quarter of the population (Harding, 1967, p. 119).²
This prosperity is the dividend of trade, amassed from a number of
surrounding villages and islands, themselves better endowed by nature
but tempted to commerce with the Siassi for reasons ranging from
material to marital utility. The Siassi regularly exchanged fish for
root crops with adjacent villages of Umboi Island; they were the sole
suppliers of pottery for many people of the Vitiaz region, transhipping
it from the few places of manufacture in northern New Guinea. In the
same way they controlled the distribution of obsidian from its place of
origin in northern New Britain. But at least equally important, the
Siassi constituted for their trade partners a rare or exclusive source
of bridewealth and prestige goods—such items as curved pigs’ tusks,
dogs’ teeth, and wooden bowls. A man in neighboring areas of New Guinea,
New Britain, or Umboi could not take a wife without some trade
beforehand, direct or indirect, with the Siassi. The total consequence
of Siassi enterprise, then, is a trade system of specific ecological
form: a circle of communities linked by the voyages of a centrally
located group, itself naturally impoverished but enjoying on balance an
inward flow of wealth from the richer circumference.

[]

[Figure 6.2 Middleman Gains of Siassi Traders (from Harding, 1967)]

Figure 6.2 Middleman Gains of Siassi Traders (from Harding, 1967)

This ecological pattern depends upon, is the precipitate of, certain
arrangements on the plane of exchange. Although the domains of different
trading peoples sometimes overlap, a group such as Siassi fairly
monopolizes carrying within its own sphere. There the “competition” is
dramatically imperfect: the several and far-flung villages of the
circumference are without direct intercourse with one another. (The
Manus went so far as to prevent other peoples of their orbit from owning
or operating seagoing canoes [cf. Mead, 1961, p. 210].) Capitalizing on
the lack of communication between distant communities, and with an eye
always toward enhancing the rates of exchange, the Siassi during
traditional times were pleased to spread fantastic tales about the
origins of goods they transmitted:

. .. cooking pots are distributed from three widely-separated locations
on the mainland [New Guinea]. No pottery in manufactured in the
archipelago [that is, Umboi, nearby islands, and western New Britain],
and people there who receive pots via the Siassis (and earlier the
Tamis) previously were not even aware that clay-pots were manmade
products. Rather, they were regarded as exotic products of the sea.
Whether the non-pottery peoples originated this belief is uncertain. The
Siassis, however, elaborated and helped to sustain such beliefs, as
everyone since has learned. Their story was that the pots are the shells
of deep-water mussels. The Sios [of New Guinea] make a specialty of
diving for these mussels and, after eating the flesh, sell the empty
“shells” to the Siassi. The deception, if it added to their value, was
justified by the vital part that pots have in overseas trade.

(Harding, 1967, pp. 139–140)

By my understanding (based on a brief visit) the Siassi in these tales
were exaggerating more directly the effort of production than the
scarcity of the pots, on the local principle that “big-fella work” is
worth “big-fella pay.” The most advanced mercantile guile was imbricated
in a most innocent labor theory of value. It is only consistent that the
customary partnership of the Vitiaz network, a kind of trade-friendship
(pren, N-M), is several degrees removed in sociability from the
trade-kinship of the Queensland system. True, the exchanges between
Siassi and their partners followed standard rates. But, secure in their
middlemen position and indispensable to their “friends,” towards whom
they were not profoundly compelled to be considerate, the Siassi in the
context of these rates were charging what the traffic would bear.
Exchange values not only varied locally with supply/demand—judging again
by the difference in terms according to distance from origin (Harding,
1967, p. 42 passim)—but monopolistic sharp practice may have afforded
discriminatory gains. As the transactional sequences show (Figure 6.2),
the Siassi, by voyaging here and there, could in principle turn a dozen
coconuts into a pig, or that one pig again into five. An extraordinary
tour of primitive passe-passe— and another apparent victory for the
businesslike interpretation of indigenous trade.³

The same confidence in the received economic wisdom is not as readily
afforded by the Huon Gulf system, for here goods of specialized local
manufacture are transacted at uniform rates throughout the network
(Hogbin, 1951). Nevertheless, a simple analysis will show that supply
and demand are once more at work.

The semicircular coastal network of the Gulf again unites ethnically
heterogeneous communities (Figure 6.3). Trade, however, is effected
through reciprocal voyaging: people of a given village visit and in turn
are visited by partners from several other places, both up and down the
coast, although usually from the nearer rather than the more distant
vicinity. The trade partners are kinsmen, their families linked by
previous intermarriage; their commerce accordingly is a sociable gift
exchange, balanced at traditional rates. Certain of these rates are
indicated in Table 6.1.

Like other New Guinea trade networks, the Huon system was not entirely
closed. Each coastal village had truck with peoples of its own immediate
hinterland. Moreover the Tami Islanders, themselves long-distance
voyagers, connected the Huon on the north with the Siassi sphere; in
traditional times the Tami disseminated within the Gulf obsidian that
had originated in New Britain. (Potters in the southern villages
likewise exported their craft further south, although little is known
about this trade.) A question is thus presented: Why isolate the Huon
Gulf as a distinct “system”? There is a double justification. First, on
the material plane the several villages apparently comprise an organic
community, retaining within their own sphere the great majority of
locally produced goods. Secondly, on the organizational level, this
kinship trade of a determinate form, and evidently also the uniform
series of exchange rates, seem to be restricted to the Gulf.⁴

[Figure 6.3 Huon Gulf Trade Network (from Hogbin, 1951)]

Figure 6.3 Huon Gulf Trade Network (from Hogbin, 1951)

For those inclined to belittle the practical (or “economic”)
significance of primitive trade, the Huon Gulf network affords a
salutory antidote. Certain villages would not have been able to exist as
constituted in the absence of trade. In the meridional reaches of the
Gulf, cultivation encounters natural difficulties, and sago and taro
have to be obtained from the Buakap and Busama districts (see Figure 6.3
and Table 6.1). “Without trade, indeed, the southern peoples [the
pottery makers] could not long survive in their present environment”
(Hogbin, 1951, p. 94). Likewise, the soil available to the Tami
Islanders of the northeast is inadequate: “Much of [their] food has to
be imported” (p. 82). In the event, food exports from fertile areas such
as Busama comprise an important fraction of local production: taro
“upwards of five tons monthly” is sent out of the community, principally
to four southern villages; whereas Busama themselves consume 28 tons
monthly (direct human subsistence). By the ample dietary standards
prevailing at Busama (p. 69) the taro exported could feed another
community of 84 people. (The average village population along the Gulf
is 200–300; Busama, with more than 600 people, is

exceptionally large.) Globally, then, the Huon Gulf presents an
ecological pattern precisely the opposite of the Vitiaz Straits: the
peripheral communities are here naturally poor, the center rich, and
there is on balance a strategic flow of wealth from the latter to the
former.

Allowing certain surmises, the dimensions of this flow can be read from
the exchange ratios of central to peripheral goods. Busama taro, for
example, is traded against southern pottery at a rate of 50 pounds of
taro to one small pot or 150 pounds to one large pot. Based on a modest
personal acquaintance with the general area, I judge this rate very
favorable to pots in terms of necessary labor time. Hogbin seems to hold
the same opinion (p. 85). In this connection, Douglas Oliver observed of
southern Bougainville, where one “medium-sized” pot is valued at the
same shell money rate as 51 pounds of taro, that the latter “represents
an incomparably larger amount of labor” (1949, p. 94). In terms of
effort, the equations of the Busama-pottery village trade appear to be
unbalanced. By the rates prevailing, the poorer communities are
appropriating to their own existence the intensified labor of the
richer.

Nevertheless, this exploitation is veiled by a disingenuous equation of
labor values. Although it appears to fool no one, the deception does
give a semblance of equity to the exchange. The potters exaggerate the
(labor) value of their product, while the Busama complain merely of its
use value:

Although etiquette prevents argument, I was interested to observe when
accompanying some Busama on a trading journey southwards how the Buso
[pottery] villagers kept exaggerating the labour involved in pot making.
“We toil all day long at it from sunrise to sunset,” one man told us
over and over again. “Extracting the clay is worse than gold mining. How
my back aches! There’s always the chance, too, that in the end the pot
will develop a crack.” The members of our [Busama] party murmured polite
agreement but subsequently brought the conversation round to the
inferior quality of present-day pots. They confined themselves to
generalitites, accusing no one in particular, but it was apparent that
here was an attempt at retaliation.

(Hogbin, 1951, p. 85)

Rates of exchange are, as noted, fairly uniform throughout the Gulf. In
any of the villages, for instance, where mats, “purses” and/or pots are
customarily exchanged, one mat–four purses–one small pot. These rates
hold regardless of distance from the point of production: a small pot is
valued at one mat either in the southern villages where pottery is made
or on the north coast where mats are made. The direct implication, that
centrally situated middlemen take no gains in the turnover of peripheral
goods, is affirmed by Hogbin. There are no “profits” to Busama in
transferring southern pots to the north or northern mats to the south
(Hogbin, 1951, p. 83).

The simple principle posed to detect supply-demand influences in the
Vitiaz and Queensland systems, where exchange values varied directly by
distance from the site of production, is therefore not applicable to the
Huon Gulf. But then the shape of the Huon “market” is different.
Technically it is less imperfect. Potentially at least, a given
community has more than one supplier of a given good, so that those
tempted to exact special gains run the risk of being bypassed. Hence the
Busama rationalization of their failure to take middlemen tolls: “Each
community needs the products of all the rest, and the natives freely
admit their willingness to sacrifice economic gain to keep within the
exchange ring” (p. 83). All this does preclude the possibility of
supply/demand effects on exchange rates. The possibility is transposed
rather to the higher level of the network as a whole. It becomes a
question of whether the relative value of one good in terms of another
reflects the respective aggregate supply/demand throughout the Gulf.

A remarkable exception to uniform rates, amounting it would seem to a
violation of the most elementary principles of good business and common
sense, suggests this is exactly the case. The Busama pay 10–12 shillings
for Tami Islander bowls and exchange them in the southern villages for
pots worth eight shillings.⁵ In explanation the Busama say of the
southern potters: “They live in such hungry country. Besides we want
pots for use for ourselves and to exchange for mats and things” (Hogbin,
1951, p. 92). Now, the explanation in terms of pots contains an
interesting implication in terms of the taro which the Busama themselves
produce. The Busama clearly suffer penalties in their southern trade
because of the limited demand for taro throughout the Gulf, especially
on the part of the northern villages, where a variety of craft goods are
produced. The “market” for taro is effectively restricted to the
southern potters. (In Hogbin’s exchange table [Table 6.1] taro is noted
only in the southern trade; reference to taro disappears from the
description of northern trade.) But if Busama taro has little
exchangeability, the pots manufactured exclusively in the south are
everywhere in demand. More than an item of consumption, these pots
become for Busama a capital item of trade, without which they would be
cut off to the north, so for which they are willing to pay dearly in
labor costs. Thus the classic business forces are in play in this sense:
the relative value of Busama taro in terms of southern pots represents
the respective demands for these goods in the Huon Gulf as a whole.⁶

The point may be made in a more abstract way. Suppose three villages, A
and B and C, each the producer of a special good, x, y, and z
respectively, are linked in a chain of trade such that A exchanges with
B and B again with C. Consider then the exchange of x against y between
villages A and B:

  ----------- --- --- ---
  Villages:   A   B   C
  Goods:      x   y   z
  ----------- --- --- ---

Assuming none of these products superabundant, the quantity of y
surrendered by B to obtain x will depend in part on the demand for y as
compared to x in village C. If in village C the demand for x is much
greater than demand for y, then B, with a view toward the eventual
acquisition of z, is willing to pay more dearly in y to obtain x from A.
Conversely, if in C the demand for y greatly outweighs x, then B will
tend to hold back y in the exchange with village A. Thus the rate on the
exchange of local products between any two villages would summarize the
demands of all villages in the system.

I open a long parenthesis. Although the analysis is justifiably broken
off at this point, with the understanding that Huon Gulf exchange values
respond to ordinary market forces, one is tempted nevertheless to press
the issue further, into a domain at once more speculative and more real,
wherein is discovered not only a certain confirmation of the thesis but
insights into the ecology, the structural limits and the history of such
a system.

In the key example that unlocked the above analysis, the Busama were
content to absorb a net loss on Tami bowls, hoping that way to encourage
the flow of pottery from the south. As it was but one exchange in an
interdependent sequence, the transaction proved unintelligible in
itself. The three-village model facilitated understanding, but still it
could not adequately represent all the constraints finally materialized
in the sale of the bowl. For behind this transaction lay a whole series
of preliminary exchanges by which Tami bowls were carried from place to
place around the Gulf, effecting in the process a large preliminary
redistribution of local specialities. It is in the hope of specifying
this redistribution, and the material pressures developing therefrom,
that further speculation is hazarded.

A four-village model is now required. To ease the re-entry into reality,
we can retain the original three (A, B, and C), while identifying B as
Busama and A then as the potters, and adding a fourth village, T, to
represent Tami with its specialized product, t (bowls). Suppose, too,
although it is not exactly the case, that the export goods of each
community are liberally demanded by all the others; and that, more
nearly true, each community exchanges only with the village or villages
directly contiguous. The objective of the exercise will be to pass Tami
bowls (t) from one end of the sequence to the other, determining thus
the total distribution of specialized products that would result.

In the hope of explaining better that notable sale of Tami bowls by
Busama to the potters (A), the exchanges first will be played out à
trois between villages B (Busama), C, and T (Tami). By the initial moves
then, T and C exchange their respective items, t and z, and villages B
and C theirs, y and z. Leaving aside the question of quantities traded,
the types of goods would, after this first round, assume the following
distribution:

[]

The second round, designed to carry an amount of t, bowls, to community
B (and of y to T) already presents certain difficulties— not
insurmountable yet symptomatic of the pressures accumulating within the
system, and of its destiny. Under the given conditions, however, there
is little choice. Village C is unlikely to accept z from B in exchange
for t, since C already produces z; hence, B can only again offer y to C
to acquire t, at that probably but part of the t in C’s possession. In
the same way T passes more t to C to obtain y. This done, the
three-village chain is completed: goods from one terminus (A still
excluded) appear at the other.

[]

Completed—but perhaps also finished. At this juncture, B (usama) finds
herself in an embarrassing relation to the global distribution of
specialities and imports, her possibilities of further trade drastically
reduced. B (usama) has nothing to put into circulation that villages
down the line, C and T, do not already have, and have probably in
quantities proportional to their proximity to B. Hence the strategic
importance of village A, the potters, to Busama. Busama’s continued
participation in the exchange network hinges now on escaping from it, on
opening a trade with A, which is also to say that the continuity of the
trade system as a whole depends on its expansion. And in this strategic
overture, the pottery of A must present itself to B not only as a use
value but as the only good enjoying exchangeability for the goods of C.
.. T. The transaction between B and A masses and brings to bear against
the pottery of A the weight of all the other goods already in the
system. Hence the exchange rates unfavorable to the goods of B (usama)
and the losses taken in labor “costs.”

May one read from an abstract model to an unknown history? Composed in
the beginning of a few communities, a trade system of the Huon type
would soon know a strong inclination to expand, diversifying its
products in circulation by extending its range in space. Peripheral
communities in particular, their bargaining position undermined during
the initial stages of trade, are impelled to search further afield for
novel items-in-trade. The network propogates itself at its extremities
by a simple extension of reciprocity, coupling in new and, it is
reasonably argued, by preference exotic communities, those that can
supply exotic goods.

(The hypothesis may for other reasons be attractive to students of
Melanesian society. Confronted by extensive trade chains such as the
kula, anthropologists have been inclined at once to laud the complexity
of the “areal integration” and wonder how it could possibly have come
about. The merit of the dynamic outlined is that it makes a simple
segmentary accretion of trade—of which Melanesian communities are
perfectly capable—also an organic complication.)

But an expansion so organized must eventually determine its own limits.
The incorporation of outside communities is achieved only at a
considerable expense to villages at the frontiers of the original
system. Transmitting the demand already occasioned by the internal
redistribution of local specialities, these peripheral villages develop
outside contacts on terms greatly disadvantageous to themselves in labor
costs. The process of expansion thereby defines an ecological perimeter.
It can continue passably enough through regions of high productivity,
but once having breached a marginal ecological zone its further advance
becomes unfeasible. Communities of the marginal zone may be only too
happy to enter the system on the favorable terms offered them, but they
are themselves in no position to support the costs of further expansion.
Not that they, become now the peripheral outposts of the network, cannot
entertain any trade beyond. Only that the trade system as organized, as
an interrelated flow of goods governed by uniform procedures and rates,
here discovers a natural boundary. Goods that pass beyond this limit
must do so under other forms and rates of exchange; they pass into
another system.⁷

Deduction thus rejoins reality. The ecological structure of the Huon
system is exactly as stipulated theoretically: relatively rich villages
in the central positions, relatively poor villages at the extremes, and
by the terms of trade a current of value and strategic goods moving from
central to marginal locations. End of parenthesis.

Summarizing to this juncture, in the three Oceanic trade systems under
review, exchange values are responsive to supply and demand—at least
insofar as supply and demand are inferable from the real distribution of
the goods in circulation. Business as usual.


Rate Variations over Time

Furthermore, the evidence so far reviewed, in the main spatially
derived, can be supplemented by observations taken over time at specific
Melanesian trade sites. Temporal variations of exchange value follow the
same iron laws—with one reservation: the rates tend to remain stable in
the short run, unaffected by even important changes in supply and
demand, although they do adjust in the long run.

Seasonal fluctuations of supply, for example, generally leave the terms
of trade untouched. Salisbury suggests of the Tolai (New Britain)
inland-coastal exchange that it could not otherwise be managed:

The net movement of tabu [shell money] from inland to coast, and
vice-versa, is small. This conflicts with the impression one gets at
different seasons, that all coastals are buying taro and not earning any
tabu, or that inlanders are buying up all the fish for ceremonials and
not selling much taro. If prices were fixed by current supply-demand
ratios, they could vary widely and unpredictably. It is in just such a
context that a trade in fixed equivalences is highly desirable, with the
“traditional” prices being those that provide an equal balance over the
long term.

(Salisbury, 1966, p. 117 n)

Over a quite long term, however, “traditional” Tolai equivalencies do
vary. Exchange rates for food in 1880 were only 50–70 percent of the
1961 rates. Apart from some overall growth in shell-money stocks, the
dynamics of this change are not altogether clear. But elsewhere in
Melanesia, long-term revisions in exchange value have clearly ensued
from the increased supplies of goods (and even shell monies) pumped into
local trade systems by Europeans. An observation from Kapauku
illustrates both tendencies here at issue, the short-run sluggishness⁸
of customary rates—although Kapauku are not famous for their fair
trading—and a long-run sensitivity:

In general, however, the fluctuation of price because of temporary
imbalance of the supply-demand level is rather infrequent . .. [But] a
steady increase of supply may bring about a steady decline of the actual
price. The permanence of this state has an effect upon the customary
price which tends to be identified with the actual payments. Thus,
before 1945, when iron axes had to be brought from the coastal people,
the customary price was l0Km for an axe. The coming of the white man and
the resulting increase and direct supply of axes, reduced the old price
to half the former amount. The process is still going on and the actual
price in 1956 tended to fall below the customary price of 5Km per axe.

(Pospisil, 1958, pp. 122–123; cf. Dubbeldam, 1964)

By 1959 an axe could be had for only two units of native currency (2Km)
(Pospisil, 1963, p. 310). Still, the Kapauku example is extraordinary,
since the economy includes a large sector of bargained exchange where
going rates may vary radically from transaction to transaction, as well
as develop long-term trends capable of communication to the balanced
reciprocity sector (cf. Pospisil, 1963, pp. 310–311).

The case is simpler in the Australian New Guinea Highlands, where the
bulk of trade is carried at standardized rates and between special
partners. Here currency values have dropped substantially since
Europeans put large quantities of shell money into circulation (Gitlow,
1947, p. 72; Meggitt, 1957–58, p. 189; Salisbury, 1962, pp. 116–117).
The same process has been observed outside Melanesia: the variations in
exchange value of horses in the intertribal trade of the American
Plains, due to changes in supply conditions (Ewers, 1955, pp. 217 f).

No doubt examples of such sensitivity to supply and demand could be
multiplied. Yet more examples would only make matters more
unintelligible—by any prevailing theory of exchange value. This
theoretical embarrassment is noteworthy and critical, and although I may
not resolve it I would count the essay a success to have raised it.
Nothing really is explained by remarking that exchange value in
primitive trade corresponds to supply/demand. For the competitive
mechanisms by which supply and demand are understood to determine price
in the market place do not exist in primitive trade. It becomes far more
mysterious that exchange ratios should respond to supply and demand than
that they remain unaffected.


The Social Organization of Primitive and Market Trade

Supply and demand are operative in the self-regulating market, pushing
prices toward equilibrium, by virtue of a two-sided competition between
sellers over buyers, and between buyers over sellers. This double
competition, symmetrical and inverse, is the social organization of
formal market theory. Without it, supply and demand cannot be realized
in price—so it is always present also, if only implicitly, in textbooks
on microeconomics. In the theoretically perfect case, all deals are
interconnected. All parties in question have access to each other as
well as full knowledge of the market, such that buyers are in a position
to compete among themselves by paying more (if necessary and possible),
sellers by asking less. In the event of an oversupply relative to the
quantity in demand at a given price, sellers contest for the limited
patronage by reducing prices; then, certain sellers withdraw because
they are unable to support the reduction, even as more buyers find the
terms attractive, until a price is reached that clears the market. In
the opposite circumstance, buyers bid up prices until the quantity
available meets the quantity demanded. The “demand crowd” clearly has no
solidarity inter se and as against the supply crowd, or vice versa. It
is the exact opposite of trade between communities of different tribes,
where internal relations of kinship and amity would stand against the
competition required by the business model— particularly in the context
of an economic confrontation with outsiders. Caveat emptor, perhaps; but
tribal sociability and homebred morality constitute an unlikely arena
for economic infighting—for no man can have honor and profit in his own
camp.

The alienated intersections of supply curves and demand curves in the
economists’ diagrams presuppose a certain structure of competition. Very
different are the procedures of primitive trade. Anyone cannot just get
into the act, enter the lists against people of his own side in quest of
the exotic goods offered by visiting strangers. Once under way, usually
in fact beforehand, trade is an exclusive relation with a specific
outside party. The traffic is canalized in parallel and insulated
transactions between particular pairs.⁹ Where trade is handled through
pamerships, exactly who exchanges with whom is prescribed in advance:
social relations, not prices, connect up “buyers” and “sell-ers.”
Lacking a trade contact, a man may not be able to get what he wants at
any price.¹⁰ There is no evidence anywhere, so far as I know, of
competitive bidding among members of a trading party for the custom of
each other’s partners; there is only the occasional observation that it
is expressly forbidden.¹¹ Haggling likewise, where it is practiced, is a
discrete relation between individuals, not a free-for-all. The nearest
documented approach to open-market trading appears to be, on one hand, a
kind of auctioning, involving competition within the demand party only,
as testified in certain Eskimo and Australian materials (Spencer, 1959,
p. 206; Aiston, 1936–37, pp. 376–377);¹² on the other hand, Pospisil
adduces a single example of a Kapauku competing with other sellers by
lowering his price on a pig for a prospective buyer—but, interestingly
enough, the man tried to come to this agreement in secret (1958, p.
123). The double and interrelated competition intrinsic to the business
model, competition by which the forces of supply and demand are
understood to regulate price, is generally not apparent in the conduct
of primitive exchange, and only exceptionally is it half-approximated.

There is always the possibility of implicit rate competition among
buyers and among sellers. I can only say I have not succeeded in
construing it from existing descriptions.¹³ Nor would it seem wise to be
cynical about the moral force of customary exchange rates, one of the
few guarantees of equity and continuity in a context pregnant with
hostility. More important, where customary rates prevail, and especially
where trade is by partnership, there are alternative strategies to
competitive undercutting which avoid the material disadvantage of
lowering selling rates or raising offers: one alternative is to acquire
more partners for trade on the usual terms; another, to be examined
later in more detail, is to overpay one’s partner for the time being,
obliging him thus to reciprocate within a reasonable period on pain of
losing dignity or partnership, so completing the transaction at normal
rates. No question that there may be competition for volume of external
trade. Internal prestige systems often hinge on it. But it does not
develop as price manipulation, product differentiation, or the like. The
standard maneuver is to increase the number of outside partners, or else
to step up trade with existing partners.

There are no markets properly so-called in these Melanesian societies.
Very likely there are none in any of the archaic societies. Bohannan and
Dalton (1962) were wrong to speak of a “market principle,” even
peripheral, in this context. They were misled on two counts by
transactions such as the gimwali, the bargaining of Trobriand
nonpartnership trade. For one, they read the market from a type of
competition not essential to it, an overt conflict between buyer and
seller.¹⁴ Secondly, they read the market from a type of transaction
taken alone, impersonal and competitive, without reference to the global
organization of these exchanges. The mistake should serve to underline
Polyani’s sometimes insistence (1959) that transactions be understood as
types of integration, not simply as types (tout court). “Reciprocity,”
“redistribution,” and market exchange were in the master’s treatment not
mere forms of economic transaction but modes of economic organization.
The determinate forms of transaction found in markets, such as sale and
(occasionally) bargaining, are encountered also in a number of primitive
instances. But lacking a symmetrical and inverse competition among
buyers and among sellers, these exchanges are not integrated as market
systems. Unless and until Trobriand haggling was so integrated (not
traditionally the case) it would afford no indication of a market
principle or of a peripheral market. Markets properly so-called,
competitive and price fixing, are universally absent from primitive
society.

But then, if the trade is not classically constituted to absorb
supply-demand pressure by price changes, the sensitivity we have
observed in Melanesian exchange values remains an intriguing mystery.


A Primitive Theory of Exchange Value

I propose no definitive solution to the mystery. Once the inadequacy of
formal economic theory is realized, and the complete unsophistication of
anthropological economics thereby discovered, it is absurd to hope for
more than partial and underdeveloped explanations. But I do have one
such primitive theory of value. As in the good Economics tradition, it
has an air of the “never-never”; yet it is consistent with the observed
conduct of certain trade, and it does suggest reasons for the
responsiveness of customary values to supply/demand. The idea is
addressed exclusively to partnership trade. The essence of it is that
rates are set by social tact, notably by the diplomacy of economic good
measure appropriate to a confrontation between comparative strangers. In
a series of reciprocal exchanges the alternating appearance of this
overbalance, first on the part of one partner then the other, would with
hardly less certainty than open price competition establish an
equilibrium rate. At the same time, the guiding principle of
“generosity” should give the agreed rate some semblance of the
equilibrium, i.e., of supply/demand.

It has to be understood that trade between primitive communities or
tribes is a most delicate, potentially a most explosive, undertaking.
Anthropological accounts document the risks of trading ventures in
foreign territory, the uneasiness and suspiciousness, the facility of a
translation from trading goods to trading blows. “There is a link,” as
Lévi-Strauss writes, “a continuity, between hostile relations and the
provision of reciprocal prestations. Exchanges are peacefully resolved
wars, and wars are the result of unsuccessful transactions” (1969, p.
67).¹⁵ If primitive society succeeds by the gift and by the clan in
reducing the state of Warre to an internal truce (see Chapter 4), it is
only to displace outward, onto the relations between clans and tribes,
the full burden of such a state. In the external sector the
circumstances are radically Hobbesian, not only lacking that “common
Power to keep them all in awe” but without even that common kinship that
might incline them all to peace. In trade, moreover, the context of the
confrontation is the acquisition of utilities; and the goods, as we have
seen, may very well be urgent. When people meet who owe each other
nothing yet presume to gain from each other something, peace of trade is
the great uncertainty. In the absence of external guarantees, as of a
Sovereign Power, peace must be otherwise secured: by extension of
sociable relations to foreigners—thus, the trade-friendship or
trade-kinship—and, most significantly, by the terms of exchange itself.
The economic ratio is a diplomatic maneuver. “It requires a good deal of
tact on the part of everyone concerned,” as Radcliffe-Brown wrote of
Andamanese interband exchange, “to avoid the unpleasantness that may
arise if a man thinks that he has not received things as valuable as he
has given. . . .” (1948, p. 42). The people must come to terms. The rate
of exchange takes on functions of a peace treaty.

Intergroup exchange does not simply answer to the “moral purpose” of
making friends. But whatever the intent and however utilitarian, it will
not do to make enemies. Every transaction, as we already know, is
necessarily a social strategy: it has a coefficient of sociability
demonstrated in its manner, and in its rates by the implied willingness
to live and let live, the disposition to give full measure in return. As
it happens, the safe and sane procedure is not just measure-for-measure,
a reciprocity precisely balanced. The most tactful strategy is economic
good measure, a generous return relative to what has been received, of
which there can be no complaints. One remarks in these intergroup
encounters a tendency to overreciprocate:

The object of the exchange [between people of different Andamanese
bands] was to produce a friendly feeling between the two persons
concerned, and unless it did this it failed of its purpose. It gave
great scope for the exercise of tact and courtesy. No one was free to
refuse a present that was offered to him. Each man and woman tried to
out-do the others in generosity. There was a sort of amiable rivalry as
to who could give away the greatest number of valuable presents.

(Radcliffe-Brown, 1948, p. 84; emphasis mine.)

The economic diplomacy of trade is “something extra” in return. Often it
is “something for the road”: the host outdoes his visiting friend, who
made the initial presentation, a “solicitory gift” in token of
friendship and the hope of safe conduct, and of course in the
expectation of reciprocity. Over the long run accounts may balance, or
rather one good turn begets another, but for the time being it is
critical that some unrequited good measure has been thrown in. Literally
a margin of safety, the exceeding generosity avoids at no great cost
“the unpleasantness that may arise if a man thinks he has not received
things as valuable as he has given,” which is to say the unpleasantness
that could be occasioned by cutting too fine. At the same time, the
beneficiary of this generosity has been put under obligation: he is “one
down”; so the donor has every right to expect equal good treatment the
next time around, when he becomes the stranger and guest of his trade
partner. On the widest view, as Alvin Gouldner has divined, these slight
unbalances sustain the relation (Gouldner, 1960, p. 175).

The procedure of transitory unbalance, bringing generous returns from
the home party to solicitory gifts, is not unique to the Andamans but in
Melanesia rather common. It is the appropriate form between trade
kinsmen of the Huon Gulf:

Kinship ties and bargaining are considered to be incompatible, and all
goods are handed over as free gifts offered from motives of sentiment.
Discussion of value is avoided, and the donor does the best he can to
convey the impression that no thought of a counter gift has entered his
head. . .. Most of the visitors . .. go home with items at least as
valuable as those with which they came. Indeed, the closer the kinship
bond, the greater the host’s generosity is, and some of them return a
good deal richer. A careful count is kept, however, and the score is
afterwards made even.

(Hogbin, 1951, p. 84)

Or again, the Massim Kula:

The offering of the pari, of landing gifts by the visitors, returned by
the talo’i, or farewell gifts from the hosts fall into the class . .. of
presents more or less equivalent.. . . The local man will as a rule
[Malinowski seems to mean by this phrase “invariably”] contribute a
bigger present, for the talo’i always exceeds the pari in quantity and
value, and small presents are also given to the visitors during their
stay. Of course, if in the pari there were included gifts of high value,
like a stone blade or a good lime spoon, such solicitary gifts would
always be returned in strictly equivalent form. The rest would be
liberally exceeded in value.

(Malinowski, 1922, p. 362)¹⁶

Suppose, then, this procedure of reciprocal good measure, as is actually
characteristic of the Huon Gulf trade. A series of transactions in which
the partners alternately manifest a certain generosity must stipulate by
inference a ratio of equivalence between the goods exchanged. One
arrives in due course at a fairly precise agreement on exchange values.

Table 6.2 presents a simple demonstration: two goods, axes and spheres,
exchanged between two partners, X and Y, over a series of reciprocal
visits beginning with X’s visit and initial gift to Y. After the first
round, the two axes given by Y are understood generous in return for the
three spears brought by X. At the end of the second round, in which Y
first compounded X’s indebtedness by two axes and was then himself
indebted by X’s gift of six spears, the implication is that nine spears
exceed four axes in value. It follows at this juncture that seven to
eight spears equals four axes, or taking into account the
indivisibilities, a rate of 2: 1 prevails. There is of course no
necessity to continually escalate gifts. At the end of the second
series, Y is down the equivalent of about one spear. Should X bring one
to three spears the next time and Y reciprocate one to three (or better,
two or three) axes, a fair average balance is maintained. Note also that
the rate is something each party mechanically agrees upon, insofar as
each understands the current balance of credit and indebtedness, and if
any serious misunderstanding does arise the partnership breaks
down—which likewise stipulates the rate at which trade must proceed.

[Table 6.2 Determination of exchange value through reciprocal good
measure]

Table 6.2 Determination of exchange value through reciprocal good
measure

Considering the comparisons (perhaps invidious) of trade returns likely
to be made with fellows of one’s own side, these understandings of
equivalence stand a chance of becoming common understandings. Comparison
of trade returns are the nearest thing to implicit internal competition
I am able to construe. Presumably, information thus gained might be
applied next time against one’s trade partner of the other community.
There seems to be very little evidence on this point, however, or on
just how precise is the available information of compatriots’
dealings—in some instances transactions with outside partners are
conducted privately and rather furtively (Harding, 1967).

[Table 6.3 Rate determination: one-way visiting]

Table 6.3 Rate determination: one-way visiting

The example before us is specifically a simple model case, supposing
reciprocal visiting and a standard presentation procedure. It is
conceivable that different trade arrangements have some other calculus
of exchange value. If, for instance, X of the simple model was a
trader-voyager, always on the visiting side, and if the same etiquette
of generosity held, the actual ratio would probably favor X’s spears
more, insofar as Y would be repeatedly obliged to be magnaminous.
Indeed, if X consistently presented three spears, and Y consistently
returned two axes, the same ratio could be maintained for four rounds
without X being down after his initial gift, even though a rate of
approximately 2: 1 is calculable midway through the second round (Table
6.3). A 3: 2 customary rate could in that event develop. Either way
there are obvious advantages to the voyaging group—though they must bear
all the transport, so that the gains over the rate for reciprocal
visiting will parallel “supply-cost” differences.

This second example is only one of many possible permutations of
exchange rate determination. Even in one-way voyaging, the etiquette of
presentation and counterpresentation may be more complicated than that
supposed (for example, Barton, 1910). I bring the example forward merely
to suggest the possibility that different formalities of exchange
generate different exchange rates.

No matter how complex the strategy of reciprocity by which an
equilibrium is finally determined, and however subtle our analysis, it
remains to be known exactly what has been determined economically. How
can it be that a rate fixed by reciprocal generosity expresses the
current average supply and demand? Everything depends on the meaning and
practice of that capital principle, “generosity.” But the meaning is
ethnographically uncertain, and therein lies the major weakness of our
theory. Only these few facts, not celebrated either for their repetition
in the documents, are known: that those who bring a certain good to the
exchange are related to it primarily in terms of labor value, the real
effort required to produce it, while those to whom the good is tendered
appreciate it primarily as a use value. That much we know from incidents
to the Huon Gulf and Siassi trade, wherein the labor of manufacture was
exaggerated by the suppliers but the product thereof depreciated by the
takers—both sides in hopes of influencing terms of trade in their own
favor (see above). From this steadfast devotion to the main chance, one
has to work back by a kind of inverted logic to the possible meaning of
“generosity.” Supposing the necessity of reciprocal good measure, it
would follow that each party has to consider, in addition to the virtues
of the goods he receives, the relative utility to the other party of the
goods he gives, and in addition to the labor he has expended himself,
the work also of the other. “Generosity” has to bring use value into
relation with use value, and labor with labor.

If so, “generosity” will bring to bear on the rate of exchange some of
the same forces, operating in the same direction, as affect price in the
marketplace. In principle, goods of higher real cost will evoke higher
returns. In principle too, if goods of greater utility oblige the
recipient to greater generosity, it is as much as saying that price is
disposed to increase with demand.¹⁷ Thus compensating efforts to the
producer and utilities to the receiver, the rates set by tactful
diplomacy will express many of the elemental conditions that are resumed
otherwise in the economist’s supply curves and demand curves. Into both
would enter, and to the same general effects, the real difficulties of
production, natural scarcities, the social uses of goods, and the
possibilities of substitution. In many respects the opposite of market
competition, the etiquette of primitive trade may conduct by a different
route to a similar result. But then, there is from the beginning a basic
similarity: the two systems share the premise that the trader should be
satisfied materially, the difference being that in the one this is left
solely to his own inclination while in the other it becomes the
responsibility of his partner. To be a diplomatically satisfactory
“price” however, the price of peace, the customary exchange ratio of
primitive trade should approximate the normal market price. As the
mechanisms differ, this correspondence can only be approximate, but the
tendency is one.


Stability and Fluctuation of Exchange Rates

Provisionally at least, we come to the following conclusion: the
material conditions expressed familiarly by the terms “supply” and
“demand” are likewise subsumed in the understandings of good treatment
built into the procedure of Melanesian trade. But then, how do exchange
ratios remain immune to short-lived changes in supply/demand?

Certain reasons for this short-term stability have already been
mentioned. First, the customary rates have moral force, understandable
from their function as standards of fair conduct in an area where
tenuous intergroup relations constantly menace the peace of trade. And
although moral practice everywhere may be vulnerable to expediency, it
is usually not so easy to change the rules. Secondly, in the event of an
unbalance of quantities on hand relative to demand (at the prevailing
rate of exchange), partnership trade opens more attractive alternatives
to cutting the “asking price” or raising the offer: better to find new
partners for trade at old rates; or else to embarrass an existing
partner by a large overpayment, obliging him to extend himself and later
on reciprocate, again thus defending the usual rate. The last is not an
hypothetical tactic of my own devising. Consider this Busama technique
for encouraging a supply of pigs:

The difference between the native method of doing business and our own
was made plain by an exchange which took place early in 1947. The
Salamaua area had suffered more damage than the northern settlements,
most of which still had their pigs. On the resumption of voyages after
the Japanese defeat, a man from Bukawa’ had the notion of bringing a
young sow to a Busama kinsman named Boya. The animal was worth about £
2, but hints indicated that pots would be more acceptable than money. A
collection of ten was required for a reasonable equivalent, and as Boya
had only five to spare he informed his relatives that anyone prepared to
assist would in due course receive a piglet. This invitation was
accepted, and twenty-two pots were contributed, making a total of
twenty-seven. All were handed over to the visitor, rather to his
surprise, as he confessed to me in private. Yet such generosity was not
as absurd as it may appear: by giving so much Boya imposed an obligation
on his guest to bring across another sow.

(Hogbin, 1951, pp. 84–85)

The success of Boya’s maneuver was made possible only by the social
qualities of the trade relation. Partnership is not merely the privilege
but the duty of reciprocity. Specifically it comprehends the obligation
to receive as well as to repay. Some people may end up with more of a
certain good than they needed, expected or bargained for, but the point
is they did not bargain for it. A trade friend is prevailed upon to
accept things for which he has no use; thereupon, he will have to
repay—for no good “economic” reason. Father Ross of Mt. Hagen seems not
to have appreciated the spiritual ethic involved:

The missionary told the author that natives who have traded with him,
and who are in needy circumstances at the moment, will come to the
mission station with items possessing no material value and which have
no utility to the missionary. The natives seek to trade these items in
exchange for things they need. Upon his refusal the natives point out to
him that his conduct is not proper, for according to their view he is
their friend and should accept a thing which he does not need so as to
assist them when they need such help. They will say to him, “You buy our
food, we sell you our pigs, our boys work for you. Therefore you should
buy this thing which you claim you do not want, and it is not right for
you to refuse to purchase it.”

(Gitlow, 1947, p. 68)¹⁸

Working the same principle, the people of the hinterland above Sio
(northeast New Guinea) may overcome their coastal partners’ reluctance
to trade:

The Sios also, of course, frequently accept goods which they do not need
at the time. When I asked one Sio man why he had four bows (most men
have more than one), he replied: “If a bush [trade–] friend comes with a
bow, you have to help him.”

(Harding, 1967, pp. 109–110)

Finally, a striking example of the same, appended by Malinowski to his
description of fish-yam exchange (wasi) between different Trobriand
communities. To this day, Malinowski noted, inland yam growers continued
to insist on their coastal partners’ obligation to receive, thus
periodically teasing from the latter a supply of fish, and at the usual
terms, though the fishing people could occupy themselves much more
profitably diving for pearls. Money thus remained the servant of custom,
and partnership the master of indigenous exchange rates:

Nowadays, when the fishermen can earn about ten or twenty times more by
diving for pearls than by performing their share of the wasi, the
exchange is as a rule a great burden on them. It is one of the most
conspicuous examples of the tenacity of native custom that in spite of
all the temptation which pearling offers them, and in spite of the great
pressure exerted upon them by white traders, the fishermen never try to
evade a wasi, and when they have received the inaugurating gift, the
first calm day is always given to fishing, and not to pearling.

(Malinowski, 1922, p. 188 n)

So acting to maintain the stability of exchange values, the trade
partnership merits a more general and respectful interpretation of its
economic significance. The primitive trade partnership is a functional
counterpart of the market’s price mechanism. A current supply-demand
imbalance is resolved by pressure on trade partners rather than exchange
rates. Where in the market this equilibrium is effected by a change in
price, here the social side of the transaction, the partnership, absorbs
the economic pressure. The rate of exchange remains undisturbed—
although the temporal rate of certain transactions may be retarded. The
primitive analogue of the business price mechanism is not the customary
exchange rate; it is the customary exchange relation.

Short-term consistency of exchange values is thus accomplished. Yet the
same deflection of the pressure from the rate of exchange to the
relation of partnership makes the latter all the more vulnerable to a
sustained discrepancy of supply-demand. Suppose a continuing and/ or
widening disparity between the traditional exchange rate and the amount
of goods actually disposable—due, it may be, to some new facility in the
acquisition of one of the goods at issue. Then partnership trade
increases the material pressure in the course of repeatedly resolving
it. Holding steady the terms of exchange, the tactic of overpayment
proves equitable and endurable only if the supply-demand unbalance is
reversible. Otherwise, an inherent tendency to accumulate volume makes
it unsupportable. For by an attack on a partner’s obligation to receive,
granted his possible delay in response, exchange proceeds always at the
quantity sought by the most importunate party. In this respect, the
inducement to production and exchange exceeds even the dynamic of the
competitive market.

That is to say, at any permutation of supply moving above or below
demand at a certain price, the volume of exchange implied by partnership
trade is greater than the analogous market equilibrium. Perhaps the
available quantity of pigs is momentarily less than the quantity
demanded at a rate of one pig = five pots; tant pis for the pig raisers:
they will have to deliver more at the same rate, to the point that all
the pots are exhausted. In the open market, the total quantity
transacted would be lower, and on terms more favorable to the trade in
pigs.

Plain to view that, if the disparity persists between the going rates
and the goods on hand, partnership trade must discover its limits as an
equilibrating mechanism, always making a supply available to the demand
and always on the usual terms. Taken at the social level, the trade
becomes irrational: one group enters into economic development by
pre-emption of another group’s labor. Nor could the harassed set of
partners be expected to indefinitely countenance the imbalance, any more
than a society that tolerated the procedure could be expected to
continue indefinitely. On the individual level the irrationality most
likely presents itself as a disutility to accumulation, more concrete
than the unrequited cost of production. There must come a moment, after
a man is in possession of five bows, or perhaps it is ten, or maybe
twenty, when he begins to wonder about the advisability of collecting
all the stuff his partner seems intent on unloading. What happens then,
when people become unwilling or unable to meet their trade obligations?
If we knew, it would unlock the last of the mysteries empirically posed
by Melanesian trade: the observed tendency of exchange values to adjust
over the long run, if not over the short, to changes in supply/demand.
For the apparent solution is to evaluate the rates. But how?

By a relocation of trade, a revision of partnerships. We know, on one
hand, what happens when a trade partner is disinclined to reciprocate.
The sanction everywhere is dissolution of the partnership. For a time a
man can stall, but if he delays too long, or fails in the end to make
the adequate return, the trade relation is broken off. In such an event,
moreover, the volume of exchange declines, and the pressure to trade
thus mounts. On the other hand, we also know (or we suppose) that the
process by which exchange value is determined in the first place, i.e.,
through reciprocal good measure, incorporates current average
supply-demand conditions. The solution, thus, to a persistent
disconfirmity between exchange values and supply/demand would be a
social process by which old partnerships are terminated and new ones
negotiated. Perhaps even the network of trade will have to be modified,
geographically and ethnically. But in any case, a fresh start, going
through with new partners the traditional tactful maneuvers of
reciprocal overpayment, restores the correspondence between exchange
value and supply/demand.

This model, if hypothetical, corresponds to certain facts, such as the
social organization of the deflation experienced in Melanesian trade
networks during the postcontact period. The indigenous trade continued
for some time without the benefit of businesslike competition. But the
same Europeans who brought excessive quantities of axes, shells or pigs
also happened to impose peace. In the colonial era the sphere of
Melanesian safe-conduct expanded, the social horizons of tribal
communities widened. A significant reshuffling and extension of trade
contacts became possible. And a revaluation of trade rates as well: as,
for example, in the coast-hinterland trade of Huon Gulf, on the whole
more recently opened up, and apparently much more sensitive to
supply/demand than the traditional maritime trade (Hogbin, 1951, p. 86;
cf. Harding, 1967).

Which leads to a final suggestion: depending on the social qualities of
the trade relation, the rates of exchange in differently organized trade
systems are probably differentially sensitive to changes in
supply/demand. The precise nature of the partnership becomes
significant: it may be more or less sociable, so admitting of longer or
shorter delays in reciprocation—trade-kinship, for example, probably
longer than trade-friendship. The prevailing relation has a coefficient
of economic fragility, and the entire system accordingly a certain
responsiveness to variations of supply/demand. The simple matter of
customary privacy or publicity may be similarly consequential; perhaps
it is feasible (for all one knows) to secretly come to new terms with
old partners. And what freedom is given within the system to recruit new
partners? Aside from the difficulties of breaking paths into villages or
ethnic groups previously outside the system, partnerships may be by
custom inherited and the set of contacts thus closed, or perhaps more
readily contracted and the exchange values thereby more susceptible to
revision. In brief, the economic flexibility of the system depends on
the social structure of the trade relation.

If the process as outlined does truly describe long-term variations in
exchange value, then at a high level of generalization and with a great
deal of imperfection it is like business competition. Of course the
differences are profound. In primitive trade, the path to economic
equilibrium lay not across the play of autonomous individuals or firms
fixing a price through the parallel contentions of buyers and sellers.
It began rather from the interdiction of competition within the
community of either, traversed a structure of institutional arrangements
that with varying facility brought together partners mutually obliged to
be generous, upon separating those not so inclined, to negotiate in the
end an analogous “price.” The similarity to market trade appears when
abstraction is made of all this—and of the protracted space-time scale,
perhaps in reality a changeover of decades from trade with one ethnic
group to partnerships in another. Then the primitive system, globally
considered, does bring those particular persons into relations of trade,
and at those rates, as reasonably reflect the availability and utility
of goods.

But what is the theoretical status of this residual resemblance? First
appreciated in its bourgeois form, does this make it the analytical
private property of conventional Economics? One might fairly judge not,
for in its bourgeois form the process is not general, while in its
general form it is not bourgeois. The conclusion to this aspect of
Melanesian trade will serve as well for the whole: a primitive theory of
exchange value is also necessary, and perhaps possible—without saying it
yet exists.



ENDNOTES


Foreword to the Routledge Classics Edition

1 For purposes of full disclosure, I consider myself, in my own modest
way, continuing this tradition, combining activist engagements with a
very self-conscious effort to pursue Mauss’ and Sahlin’s tradition of
publicly engaged economic anthropology.

2 I note in passing that, in a remarkable example of intellectual
convergence, the three concentric circles model is almost exactly the
same as the one produced by Edmund Leach himself in “Animal Categories
and Verbal Abuse” to describe the relation of marriage patterns and
attitudes towards animals. The two pieces appeared at almost exactly the
same time, 1964, and 1965, respectively, and neither author seems to
have been aware of the other beforehand.


1 The Original Affluent Society

1 At least to the time Lucretius was writing (Harris, 1968, pp. 26–27).

2 On the historically particular requisites of such calculation, see
Codere, 1968 [especially pp. 574–575].

3 For the complementary institutionalization of “scarcity” in the
conditions of capitalist production, see Gorz, 1967, pp. 37–38.

4 It deserves mention that contemporary European-Marxist theory is often
in accord with bourgeois economics on the poverty of the primitive. Cf.
Boukharine, 1967; Mandel, 1962, vol. 1; and the economic history manual
used at Lumumba University (listed in bibliography as “Anonymous,
n.d.”).

5 Elman Service for a very long time almost alone among ethnologists
stood out against the traditional view of the penury of hunters. The
present paper owes great inspiration to his remarks on the leisure of
the Arunta (1963, p. 9), as well as to personal conversations with him.

6 The evident fault of White’s evolutionary law is the use of “per
capita” measures. Neolithic societies in the main harness a greater
total amount of energy than preagricultural communities, because of the
greater number of energy-delivering humans sustained by domestication.
This overall rise in the social product, however, is not necessarily
effected by an increased productivity of labor—which in White’s view
also accompanied the neolithic revolution. Ethnological data now in hand
(see text infra) raise the possibility that simple agricultural regimes
are not more efficient thermodynamically than hunting and gathering—that
is, in energy yield per unit of human labor. In the same vein, some
archaeology in recent years has tended to privilege stability of
settlement over productivity of labor in explanation of the neolithic
advance (cf. Braidwood and Wiley, 1962).

7 For a similar comment, referring to missionary misinterpretation of
curing by blood consumption in eastern Australia, see Hodgkinson, 1845,
p. 227.

8 Conditions of primitive hunting peoples must not be judged, as Carl
Sauer notes, “from their modern survivors, now restricted to the most
meagre regions of the earth, such as the interior of Australia, the
American Great Basin, and the Arctic tundra and taiga. The areas of
early occupation were abounding in food” (cited in Clark and Haswell,
1964, p. 23).

9 Through the prison of acculturation one glimpses what hunting and
gathering might have been like in a decent environment from Alexander
Henry’s account of his bountiful sojurn as a Chippewa in northern
Michigan: see Quimby, 1962.

10 Turnbull similarly notes of Congo pygmies: “The materials for the
making of shelter, clothing, and all other necessary items of material
culture are all at hand at a moment’s notice.” And he has no
reservations either about subsistence: “Throughout the year, without
fail, there is an abundant supply of game and vegetable foods” (1965, p.
18).

11 Certain food collectors not lately known for their architectural
achievements seem to have built more substantial dwellings before being
put on the run by Europeans. See Smythe, 1871, vol. 1, pp. 125–128.

12 But recall Gusinde’s comment: “Our Fuegians procure and make their
implements with little effort” (1961, p. 213).

13 Fish Creek was an inland camp in western Arnhem Land consisting of
six adult males and three adult females. Hemple Bay was a coastal
occupation on Groote Eylandt; there were four adult males, four adult
females, and five juveniles and infants in the camp. Fish Creek was
investigated at the end of the dry season, when the supply of vegetable
foods was low; kangaroo hunting was rewarding, although the animals
became increasingly wary under steady stalking. At Hemple Bay, vegetable
foods were plentiful; the fishing was variable but on the whole good by
comparison with other coastal camps visited by the expedition. The
resource base at Hemple Bay was richer than at Fish Creek. The greater
time put into food-getting at Hemple Bay may reflect, then, the support
of five children. On the other hand, the Fish Creek group did maintain a
virtually full-time specialist, and part of the difference in hours
worked may represent a normal coastal-inland variation. In inland
hunting, good things often come in large packages; hence, one day’s work
may yield two days’ sustenance. A fishing-gathering regime perhaps
produces smaller if steadier returns, enjoining somewhat longer and more
regular efforts.

14 At least some Australians, the Yir-Yiront, make no linguistic
differentiation between work and play (Sharp, 1958, p. 6).

15 This appreciation of local resources is all the more remarkable
considering that Lee’s ethnographic work was done in the second and
third years of “one of the most severe droughts in South Africa’s
history” (1968, p. 39; 1969, p. 73 n).

16 As were the Tasmanians, of whom Bonwick wrote: “The Aborigines were
never in want of food; though Mrs. Somerville has ventured to say of
them in her ‘Physical Geography’ that they were ‘truly miserable in a
country where the means of existence were so scanty.’ Dr. Jeannent, once
Protector, writes: ‘They must have been superabundantly supplied, and
have required little exertion or industry to support themselves.’
’’(Bonwick, 1870, p. 14).

17 This by way of contrast to other tribes deeper in the Central
Australian Desert, and specifically under “ordinary circumstances,” not
the times of long-continued drought when “he has to suffer privation”
(Spencer and Gillen, 1899, p. 7).

18 Basedow goes on to excuse the people’s idleness on the grounds of
overeating, then to excuse the overeating on the grounds of the periods
of hunger natives suffer, which he further explains by the droughts
Australia is heir to, the effects of which have been exacerbated by the
white man’s exploitation of the country.

19 This phrase appears in a paper by Woodburn distributed to the
Wenner-Gren symposium on “Man the Hunter,” although it is only
elliptically repeated in the published account (1968, p. 55). I hope I
do not commit an indiscretion or an inaccuracy citing it here.

20 “Agriculture is in fact the first example of servile labor in the
history of man. According to biblical tradition, the first criminal,
Cain, is a farmer” (Lafargue, 1911 [1883], p. 11 n).

It is notable too that the agricultural neighbours of both Bushmen and
Hadza are quick to resort to the more dependable hunting-gathering life
come drought and threat of famine (Woodburn, 1958, p. 54; Lee, 1968, pp.
39–40).

21 This common distaste for prolonged labor manifested by recently
primitive peoples under European employ, a distaste not restricted to
ex-hunters, might have alerted anthropology to the fact that the
traditional economy had known only modest objectives, so within reach as
to allow an extraordinary disengagement, considerable “relief from the
mere problem of getting a living.”

The hunting economy may also be commonly underrated for its presumed
inability to support specialist production. Cf. Sharp, 1934–35, p. 37;
Radcliffe-Brown, 1948, p. 43; Spencer, 1959, pp. 155, 196, 251; Lothrup,
1928, p. 71; Steward, 1938, p. 44. If there is not specialization, at
any rate it is clearly for lack of a “market,” not for lack of time.

22 At the same time that the bourgeois ideology of scarcity was let
loose, with the inevitable effect of downgrading an earlier culture, it
searched and found in nature the ideal model to follow if man (or at
least the workingman) was ever to better his unhappy lot: the ant, the
industrious ant. In this the ideology may have been as mistaken as in
its view of hunters. The following appeared in the Ann Arbor News,
January 27, 1971, under the head, “Two Scientists Claim Ants a Little
Lazy”: Palm Springs, Calif. (AP)—“Ants aren’t all they are reported
[reputed?] to be,” say Drs. George and Jeanette Wheeler.

The husband-wife researchers have devoted years to studying the
creatures, heroes of fables on industriousness.

“Whenever we view an anthill we get the impression of a tremendous
amount of activity, but that is merely because there are so many ants
and they all look alike,” the Wheelers concluded.

“The individual ants spend a great deal of time just loafing. And, worse
than that, the worker ants, who are all females, spend a lot of time
primping.”


2 The Domestic Mode of Production I

1 Following the slight rephrasing by Brown and Brookfield (1963),
Allan’s formula is: “carrying capacity” = 100 CL/P where P is the
percentage of arable available to the community, L is the mean acreage
per capita under cultivation and C a factor of the number of garden
units needed for a full cycle, calculated as fallow period + cultivation
period/fallow period. The result of 100 CL/P is the amount of land
required to support one person in perpetuity. This is then converted
into a density per square mile or square kilometer.

2 This conclusion is framed for the population, globally considered,
practicing a determinate form of agriculture; it does not preclude that
localized subgroups (families, lineages, villages), under the given
rules of recruitment and land tenure, will not experience “population
pressure.” Such of course is a structural problem, not posed by
technology or resources per se.

3 Four of the 26 groups were above capacity. All four, however, fall
into the two lowest of four categories of data reliability developed by
Brown and Brookfield. Only Naregu received the highest classification of
reliability. Groups in the second highest had the following indexes of
actual to potential population: 0.8 (two cases), 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.3.

4 According to a recent FAO report, some 14 million square miles,
occupied by 200 million people, are still exploited by slash-and-burn
(cited in Conklin, 1961, p. 27). Of course, not all of this is primitive
domain.

5 The consistent discrepancy between population density and agricultural
capacity, even where the former attains 200-plus people/square mile,
raises more than one passionate theoretical question. What are we to
make of the popular inclination to invoke demographic pressure on
resources in explanation of diverse economic and political developments
ranging from the intensification of production to the elaboration of
patrilineal structure or the formation of the state? First of all, it is
not evident that archaic economies know a tendency to reach, let alone
exceed, the population capacity of their means of production. On the
other hand, it is evident that current mechanistic explanations from
demographic cause—or, conversely, the inference of “population pressure”
from an observed economic or political “effect”—are often
oversimplified. In any given cultural formation, “pressure on land” is
not in the first instance a function of technology and resources, but
rather of the producers’ access to sufficient means of livelihood. The
latter clearly is a specification of the cultural system-relations of
production and property, rules of land tenure, relations between local
groups, and so forth. Except in the theoretically improbable case in
which the customary rules of access and labor are consistent with
optimum exploitation of land, a society may experience “population
pressure” of various kinds and degrees at global densities below its
technical capacity of production. Thus the threshold of demographic
pressure is not an absolute determination of the means of production but
is relative to the society at issue. Moreover, how this pressure is
organizationally experienced, the level of the social order to which it
is communicated, as well as the character of the response, also depend
on the institutions in place. (This point is well made by Kelly’s study
of the problem in the New Guinea Highlands, 1968.) Hence both the
definition of population pressure and its social effects pass by way of
the existing structure. Consequently, any explanation of historical
events or developments, such as warfare or the origin of the state, that
ignores this structure is theoretically suspect.

6 These Pirie had himself culled from the Arusha symposium on
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in Modern African States
(1961). This publication was not available to me on writing. Pirie’s
article, moreover, raises some question about the control of predators
(p. 411), the significance of which is unclear but which may have
bearing on the figures for wild animal yields.

7 Allan, on the other hand, finds among pastoralists some urge to
accumulate cattle that may outstrip pasturage capacities, and at least
two peoples, Masai and Mukogodo, with an apparent “excess of livestock
in relation to the economic requirement of simple pastoralism” (1965, p.
311).

8 This is not at all unique to Lele. Polygyny in a society of more or
less balanced sex ratio usually means late first marriages for most men.
While an only casual interest in production is not also necessary, it is
at least consistent and often encountered.

9 Again I merely raise the point here, reserving it for fuller
discussion later (Chapter 3).

10 The concrete case described in greatest detail concerns the village
of Kasaka, for which Richards recorded a general calender of activities
covering mainly September 1933, and work diaries of 38 adults over 23
days (Richards, 1961, pp. 162–64 and Table E). Only the old men worked
regularly, “those reckoned by the Government as too feeble to pay tax.”
Richards observes: “Five old men worked 14 days out of 20; seven young
men worked seven days out of 20 . .. it is obvious that any community in
which the young and active males work exactly half as the old must
suffer as regards its food production” (p. 164 n). The records refer to
a season of less-than-average agricultural intensity, but not the famous
Bemba hunger period.

11 “The herding of livestock does not absorb the energies of the entire
[Masai] population, and the young men from the ages of about sixteen to
thirty live apart from their families and clans as warriors” (Forde,
1963 [1934], p. 29 f).

12 Cf. Clark, 1938, p. 9; Rivers, 1906, pp. 566–67. As for
middle-eastern Arabs, however, “The male Arab is quite content to pass
the day smoking, chatting and drinking coffee. Herding the camels is his
only office. All the work of erecting tents, looking after sheep and
goats and bringing water, he leaves to his women” (Awad, 1962, p. 335).

13 Among Tiv, “ ‘Labor’ is the factor of production in greatest supply”
(Bohan-nan and Bohannan, 1968, p. 76).

14 Here is another society, however, in which labor obligation seems
unevenly divided by sex, and also by age-class. For in addition to
gardening, Kapauku women do a substantial amount of fishing, pig
tending, and housework, even as their men are sometimes away three and
four months in trading or war expeditions, and the unmarried men in
particular maintain all the while a steady indifference to cultivation
(Pospisil, 1963, p. 189).

15 Although Tiv also “prefer to work very hard and at a terrific pace
and then do almost nothing for a day or two” (Bohannan and Bohannan,
1968, p. 72).

16 Of course, even as there remains a question whether such a slight
record can be representative of the Nupe economic condition, it is also
questionable whether Nupe are truly representative of a primitive
economy.

17 Theoretically November to March, but see Richards, 1962, p. 390.

18 Richards’s comments on the duration of the working day provide
additional pertinent information: “Bemba rise at 5 a.m. in the hot
weather, but come reluctantly from their huts at 8 or even later in the
cold season, and their working day is fixed accordingly . .. the Bemba
in his unspecialized society does different tasks daily and a different
amount of work each day. The diary of men’s and women’s activities . ..
shows that in Kampamba the men were employed on five quite separate
occupations . .. in the course of ten days, and at Kasaka . .. various
ritual observances, visits from friends or Europeans, interrupted the
daily routine constantly. Domestic needs tie the women to certain daily
tasks . .. but even then their garden work varies greatly from day to
day. The working hours also change in what seems to us a most erratic
manner. In fact I do not think the people ever conceive of such periods
as the month, week, or day in relation to regular work at all. . .. The
whole bodily rhythm of the Bemba differs completely from that of a
peasant in Western Europe, let alone an industrial worker. For instance
at Kasaka, in a slack season, the old men worked 14 days out of 20 and
the young men seven; while at Kampamba in the busier season, the men of
all ages worked on an average of 8 out of 9 working days [Sunday not
included]. The average working day in the first instance was 2¾ hours
for men and 2 hours gardening plus 4 hours domestic work for the women,
but the figures varied from 0 to 6 hours a day. In the second case the
average was 4 hours for the men and 6 for the women, and the figures
showed the same daily variation” (1962, pp. 393–94).

19 Cf. the analogous report from the Cameroons cited by Clark and
Haswell (1964, p. 117).

20 “A strange delusion possesses the working classes of the nations
where capitalist civilization holds its sway. This delusion drags in its
train the individual and social woes which for two centuries have
tortured sad humanity. This delusion is the love of work, the furious
passion for work, pushed even to the exhaustion of the vital force of
the individual and his progeny. Instead of opposing this mental
aberration, the priests, the economists and the moralists have cast a
sacred halo over work” (Lafargue, 1909, p. 9).

21 See the reference to McCarthy and MacArthur’s study of Australian
hunting in Chapter 1. “The quantity of food gathered in any one day by
any of these groups could in every instance be increased. . . . ”
Woodburn writes to the same effect of the Hadza: “When a man goes off
into the bush with his bow and arrows, his main interest is usually to
satisfy his hunger. Once he has satisfied his hunger by eating berries
or by shooting and catching some small animal, he is unlikely to make
much effort to shoot a large animal. . .. Men most often return from the
bush empty-handed but with their hunger satisfied” (1968, p. 53; cf. p.
51). Women, meanwhile, are doing essentially the same.

22 Again this is no necessary contradiction to the “original affluent
society” of Chapter 1, which was defined on the collective level and in
terms of consumption, not production. The deficiencies here indicated in
domestic production do not at all preclude amelioration by
interhousehold distribution. On the contrary, they make intelligible the
intensity of such distribution.

23 By contrast, in a parallel study of six household outputs among the
Lamet of Laos, Izikowitz (1951) found considerable variation, but all on
the surplus-over-subsistence side. (The Lamet apparently depend more on
rice sales than the Iban, and have apparently done so for a longer
time.) Cf. also Geddes, 1954, on the Land Dayak.

24 However, it may be that the figure of one acre/head was determined in
part from the actual tendency of gardens to cluster around that
ratio—coupled with evidence from a neighboring region that such an
amount should suffice. The norm of one acre/capita, moreover, does not
make allowance for differential food requirements of men, women, and
children, important when assessing the economic success of particular
households. In a later section discussing household labor intensity
(Chapter 3), such adjustments are made in the Mazulu data.

25 Of the Lele, for example, nothing said here will be as satisfactory
as Mary Douglas’s excellent analysis (1960).

26 “Mode of production” is here differently employed than by Terray
(following Althusser and Balibar) in his important work Le Marxisme
devant les sociétés primitives (1969). Apart from the obvious difference
in attention to superstructural “instances,” the main contrast concerns
the theoretical importance accorded various forms of cooperation, that
is, as constituting corporate structures in control of productive forces
over and against the domestic units. Such an importance is here refused,
and from this divergence follow many of the others. Nevertheless, in
spite of these significant differences, it will be obvious that the
present perspective joins with Terray’s on many points, and also with
that of Meillassoux (1960; 1964), which was the basis for Terray’s work.

27 Of course a great deal of knowledge is required for the development
and maintenance of modem machinery; the above sentence confines itself
to the relation of man and tool in the process of production.

28 Marx’s appreciation of the machine revolution, earlier of course than
Veblen’s, is very close to the latter in wording: “Along with the tool,
the skill of the workman in handling it passes over to the machine. . ..
In handicrafts and manufacture, the workman makes use of a tool, in the
factory, the machine makes use of him. There the movements of the
instrument of labour proceed from him, here it is the movements of the
machine that he must follow. In [prefactory] manufacture the workmen are
parts of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism
independent of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage. . ..
Every kind of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a
labour-process, but also a process of creating surplus-value, has this
in common, that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of
labour, but the instruments of labour that employ the workman” (1967a,
vol 1, pp. 420–23). For Marx, it should be noted, the critical turning
point in the man-tool relation was not the substitution of nonhuman
power, but the attachment of tools to a transmission and
motor-mechanism; the last might still be human but the workman had
effectively been alienated from the instruments of labor, the skill of
handling them now passing over to the machine. This is the indicative
criterion of the machine and the real beginning of the industrial
revolution.

29 Long unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world, Chayanov’s work (1966)
assembles a large array of statistical information and intellectual
ponderation of passionate interest to the student of precapitalist
economies. (This praise is not to be tempered by the obvious
disagreement between the theoretical perspective of the present work and
the marginalist reading Chayanov gives in the end to his more
substantial reflections.)

30 Chayanov supplies the complete table for 25 families (1966, p. 77).
The average number of working days/worker/year was 131.8; the median,
125.8.

31 “In the first place the wealth of the old tribal and village
communities was in no sense a domination over men. And secondly, even in
societies moving in class antagonisms, insofar as wealth includes
domination over men, it is mainly and almost exclusively a domination
over men by virtue of, and through the intermediary of, the domination
over things” (Engels, 1966, p. 205).

32 The scheme of the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality among Men is
more complicated. True that men in the first period were isolated, but
for lack of sociable qualities. By the time Rousseau brought in the
potential conflict that in the analyses of others (such as Hobbes) was
functionally linked to dispersion, something like society already
existed and the earth was fully occupied. However, it is clear that
Rousseau had the same understanding of the relation between private
force and dispersion, because he felt compelled to explain in footnote
why at this later time people were not centrifugally scattered, that is,
because the earth had already been filled (1964, vol. 3, pp. 221–22).


3 The Domestic Mode of Production II

1 The determination of the main organization of production at an
infrastruc-tural level of kinship is one way of facing the dilemma
presented by primitive societies to Marxist analyses, namely, between
the decisive role accorded by theory to the economic base and the fact
that the dominant economic relations are in quality superstructural,
e.g., kinship relations (see Godelier, 1966; Terray, 1969). The scheme
of the preceding paragraphs might be read as a transposition of the
infrastructure-superstructure distinction from different types of
institutional order (economy, kinship) to different orders of kinship
(household versus lineage, clan). In truth, however, the present
problématique was not directly framed to meet this dilemma.

2 The same can be phrased also as an inverse relation between intensity
and the proportion for workers, a formulation used earlier and to which
we return presently.

3 All persons indicated in Scudder’s table as “unmarried people for whom
the wife must cook,” and who were not further tabulated as gardeners,
were counted as preadolescent children. Probably some dependent elders
have thus slipped in as 0.50 consumers.

4 Besides incertainties in the data, there are external complications,
some of which are indicated in footnotes to Table 3.1. One, however,
must be considered in greater detail. There is a modest amount of cash
cropping in Mazulu, mainly of tobacco, with the proceeds invested
principally in animal stock. The effects upon the domestic production of
cereals are not altogether clear, but the figures on hand probably have
not been seriously deformed by crop sales. The total volume of produce
sale is quite limited; of subsistence crops in particular,
insignificant. At the time of study, Scudder writes, “most valley Tonga
were essentially subsistence cultivators who rarely sell a guinea’s
worth of produce per annum” (1962, p. 89). Nor did cash cropping appear
an alternative to subsistence gardening, that is, as a means of food
purchase, so capable of direct interference in cereal cultivation.
Finally, in such cases of simple commodity production, it must be
considered whether trade actually removes the exchangeable food surplus
from internal community circulation. It happens that those Tongan
farmers who convert produce into animal stock are precisely the ones
most subject to imperious requests from relatives at times of food
shortage—for animals constitute a reserve that may be again sold for
grain (pp. 89 f, 179–180; Colson, 1960, p. 38 f).

5 6xy = Σ (xy)/ Σ (x²), where x = the deviation of each unit from the x
mean (c/w mean), y the deviation from the y (a/w) mean. Given the
limited and scattered distribution of household differences, it should
be stressed that the regression in the Mazulu case (and in subsequent
cases treated) has little predictive or inductive value. It has been
adopted here simply as a description of the main drift in the
variations.

6 For a diagrammatic indication of Chayanov’s rule formulated as an
inverse relation, see the interesting analysis of the covariation
between domestic labor force and preferred intensities of labor among
Indian farm families presented in Clark and Haswell, 1964, p. 116.

7 Subject to the caveat, actually realized in the Botukebo case, where
the big-man’s production is not extraordinary, that a leader who has
successfully piled up credits and followers may eventually slacken his
own particular efforts.

8 A theoretical argument can be made for inclusion in the domestic
quotas of consumption, hence in the slope of normal intensity, an extra
amount of sweet potato equivalent to the feed that would be needed to
supply a normal per capita pork ration. Apart, however, from arguments
also possible to the contrary, the published data do not readily lend
themselves to this calculation.

9 Pigs included, village production still surpassed the collective
subsistence norm (Pospisil, 1963, p. 394 f).

10 In the same vein, among Ituri Pygmies: “When the hunt returns to camp
there is immediate excitement as those who stayed behind crowd around
for tales of all that happened, and maybe for a few tidbits of raw meat.
In the confusion, men and women alike but particularly women, may be
seen furtively concealing some of their spoils under the leaves of their
roofs, or in empty pots nearby. For although there will have been some
sharing on the scene, there is always more back in the camp, and family
loyalty is not that subject to band loyalty that there is no cheating”
(Turnbull, 1965, p. 120; cf. Marshall, 1961, p. 231).

11 The phrase is L. Althusser’s. See his discussion of “L’objet du
Capital” (Althusser, Rancière, et al.; 1966, vol. 2).

12 Firth’s interpretation of the social conflict of interest as an
opposition between the individual and the society unfortunately lends
itself to the grand mystification now prevailing in comparative
economics, for the elaboration of which anthropologists join with
economists to prove that savages are often moved by a crass
self-concern, even as businessmen are pursuing higher ends: hence people
everywhere act on mixed “economic” and “non-economic” motives, and, the
classic economizing behavior being everywhere the same in principle, it
is universally valid in analysis. On one hand, if the “native” engages
in reciprocal exchange to no net material increment, still he may be
looking toward a tangible utility, inasmuch as the gift given now when
it can be afforded may be returned later on when it is most needed. On
the other hand, the bourgeoisie have been known to contribute to charity
and otherwise derive spiritual benefits from material profits. The
objective returns to a given deployment of resources, whether to maximum
material gain or some other use, are thus confused with the economic
subject’s own final relation to the process. Both are called “utilities”
or “ends.” The de facto returns in this way confounded with the
subjective satisfactions, and the motivations of the subject with the
nature of his activity, one is permitted to ignore the real differences
in the way goods are handled in favor of apparent resemblances in the
satisfactions gained. The attempt of the “formalist school” to detach
the principle of individual maximization from its bourgeois context and
spread it around the world is fatally marked by this confusion. Cf.
Burling, 1962; Cook, 1966; Robbins, 1935; Sahlins, 1969.

13 This pulsation is discussed further in Chapter 5. It is controlled on
one hand by the rule that generosity tends to be more widely extended
when differences in wealth appear within the community, and on the
other, by the ability of the social system, given its constituted
solidarities, to support this exceptional generosity, an ability that
decreases as the general hardship increases.

14 In the terms adopted in Chapter 5, pooling and generalized
reciprocity were now declining in the social sphere, as negative
reciprocity extended its range.

15 We shall see shortly that the principle is organized in various ways.
But in some instances the entire scheme of rank is left to the free play
of generosity, as in Busama, where: “The relation of debtors to
creditors forms the basis of the system of leadership” (Hogbin, 1951, p.
122).

16 “Mutual helpfulness” (Mead, 1934, p. 335), “continual reciprocity
between chief and people” (Firth, 1959a, p. 133), “mutually dependent”
(Ivens, 1927, p. 255). For other examples see Richards, 1939, pp.
147–150, 214; Oliver, 1955, p. 342; Drucker, 1937, p. 245. See also
Chapter 5. In speaking of “reciprocity” I refer here to the ideological
economic relation between headmen and the underlying population, not
necessarily to the concrete form. The latter may be technically
“redistribution.” Even so, redistribution is conceived and sanctioned as
a reciprocal relation, and is in form but a centralization of
reciprocities.

17 One reason (or rationale) why Western social science, with its
disposition to accept or even privilege the native models, has so much
difficulty with “exploitation.” Or is it that, having trouble with
“exploitation,” it is disposed to privilege the native model?

18 If again this ideology seems more widespread than primitive society,
perhaps in that respect it can be taken in confirmation of Marx’s dictum
that what is not visible in modern economy is often seen en clair in
primitive economy—to which Althusser adds that what is seen en clair in
primitive economy is that “l’ économique n’est pas directment visible en
clair” (Althusser et al., 1966a, Vol 2, p. 154).

19 Cf. Hogbin, 1939, p. 35; Oliver, 1949, p. 89; 1955, p. 446, for
similar passages, or more generally, Sahlins, 1963. One could easily
collect the same observations from outside Melanesia. For example: “A
man who can afford to acquire all these expensive things which are
connected with the cult of the ancestors, and sacrifice so much at these
rites, must be a particularly clever person, and thus his reputation and
his prestige grow with every feast. In this connection social prestige
plays an excessive part, and I should even like to assume that the feast
of the ancestors and all connected with it is the driving force in the
entire economic and social life of the Lamet. It forces the more
aspiring and ambitious to produce more than what is required for the
necessities of life . .. This striving for prestige plays a particularly
important part in the economic life of the Lamet, and urges them to a
surplus production” (Izikowitz, 1951, pp. 332, 341, emphasis mine).

20 See Handy, 1940 for these and other details of Hawaiian irrigation.
W. Bennett reported of Kauai: “The impressive feature of the
agricultural terracing is its tremendous extent. In the valleys in which
little disturbance has gone on, particularly the Napali section, the
maximum of tillable soil was utilized. On the sides of the valleys the
terraces run almost to the base of the great cliffs, where the nature of
the talus slopes is not too rocky. Though all these terraces were not
irrigated, a great proportion of them were, and the ingenuity of the
engineering is remarkable” (1931, p. 21).

21 Perhaps in part because of the intervention of the colonial power—and
the ethnographers who at times acted in quasi-governmental capacity
(Spillius, 1957).

22 Here is one example of this geopolitics of rebellion: Kalaniopu’u,
supreme chief of the large island of Hawaii—the same who was paternal
uncle and predecessor of Kamehameha I—held court for a time in the Kona
district of the southwest. But, tradition relates, “scarcity of food,
after a while, obliged Kalaniopu’u to remove his court to the Kohala
district [in the northwest], where his headquarters were fixed at
Kapaau” (Fornander, 1878–85, vol. 2, p. 200). What had apparently
rendered food scarce in Kona was now repeated in Kohala: “Here the same
extravagant, laissez-faire, eat and be merry policy continued that had
been commenced at Kona, and much grumbling and discontent began to
manifest itself among the resident chiefs and cultivators of the land,
the ‘Makaainana’ ” (ibid.). The local grumbling was echoed by a distant
rumbling from the outlying district of Puna, across to the island to the
southeast. The two factions apparently combine, and the tale then takes
on its customary Olympian form, a story of battle joined between great
chiefs. The principal rebels were Imakakaloa of Puna and one Nu’uanu, a
chief of Ka’u who had once lived in Puna but was now in attendance at
Kalaniopu’u’s court. These two, as Fornander writes, were “the heads and
rallying points” of the unrest. From distant Puna, Imakaka-loa “openly
resisted the orders of Kalaniopu’u and his extravagant demands for all
kinds of property.” Nu’uanu, at the side of the paramount, “was strongly
suspected of favoring the growing discontent” (ibid.). This time,
however, the gods were with Kalaniopu’u. Nu’uanu died of a shark bite,
and after a series of battles, Imakakaloa was trapped, captured, and
duly sacrificed.

23 Hakau is described by another collector of tradition as “rapacious
and extortionate beyond endurance of either chiefs or people”
(Fornander, 1878–85, vol. 2, p. 76).

24 On genealogical idiom see Malo, 1951, p. 52.


4 The Spirit of the Gift

1 An English translation of L’Essai sur le don has been prepared by Ian
Cunnison, and published as The Gift (London: Cohen and West, 1954).

2 Hereinafter, I will use the Biggs version except where the argument
about Mauss’s interpretation requires that one cite only the documents
available to him. I take this opportunity to thank Professor Biggs for
his generous help.

3 It seems from Firth’s account that the same procedure was used both
against thieves and ingrates. I appeal here to Maori authorities for
clarification. From my own very limited and entirely textual experience,
it seems that the goods of a victimized party were used particularly in
sorcery against thieves. Here, where the culprit usually is not known,
some portion of the goods remaining—or something from the place they
were kept—is the vehicle for identifying or punishing the thief (for
example, Best, 1924, vol. 1, p. 311). But sorcery against a known person
is typically practiced by means of something associated with him; thus,
in a case of failure to repay, the goods of the deceiver would be more
likely to serve as vehicle than the gift of the owner. For further
interest and confusion, such a vehicle associated with the victim of
witchcraft is known to the Maori as hau. One of the entries under “hau ”
in W. Williams’s dictionary is: “something connected with a person on
whom it is intended to practice enchantment; such as a portion of his
hair, a drop of his spittle, or anything which has touched his person,
etc., which when taken to the tohunga [ritual expert] might serve as a
connecting link between his incantations and their object” (Williams,
1892).

4 The intervention of a third party thus offers no obscurity to Firth.
The exchange between second and third parties was necessary to introduce
a second good that could stand for the first, or for the hau of the
first (cf. Firth, 1959a, p. 420 n).

5 “When Mauss sees in the gift exchange an interchange of personalities,
‘a bond of souls,’ he is following, not native belief, but his own
intellectualized interpretation of it” (Firth, 1959a, p. 420).

6 In his latest word on the subject, Firth continues to deny the
ethnographic validity of Mauss’s views on the Maori hau, adding also
that no such spiritual belief is involved in Tikopian gift exchange
(1967). Too, he now has certain critical reservations on Mauss’s
discussion of the obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate. Yet at
one level he would agree with Mauss. Not in the sense of an actual
spiritual entity, but in the more generalized social and psychological
sense of an extension of the self, the gift does partake of its donor
(ibid., pp. 10–11, 15–16).

7 In the original Maori as published by Best, the passage on gifts was
actually intercalculated as an explanatory aside between two
descriptions of the ceremony. The continuous English translation,
however, deletes the main part of the first description, this Best
having cited a page earlier (1909, p. 438). Besides, both English and
Maori texts begin with a discussion of witchcraft spells, not apparently
related to the ceremonial or the gift exchange, but about which more
later.

8 There is a very curious difference between the several versions of
Best, Mauss, and Tamati Ranapiri. Mauss appears to deliberately delete
Best’s reference to the ceremony in the opening phrase. Best had cited
“I will now speak of the hau, and the ceremony of whangai hau” whereas
Mauss has it merely, “Je vais vous [sic] parler du hau . . . ” (ellipsis
is Mauss’s). The interesting point is raised by Biggs’s undoubtedly
authentic translation, much closer to that of Mauss, as it likewise does
not mention whangai hau at this point: “Now, concerning the hau of the
forest.” However, even in this form the original text linked the message
on taonga with the ceremony of whangai hau, “fostering” or “nourishing
hau,” since the hau of the forest was not the subject of the immediately
succeeding passage on gifts but of the consequent and ultimate
description of the ceremony.

9 I use Best’s translation, the one available to Mauss. I also have in
hand Biggs’s interlinear version; it does not differ significantly from
Best’s.

10 The earlier discussion of this ritual, preceeding the passage on
taonga in the full Maori text, in fact comments on two related
ceremonies: the one just described and another, performed before, by
those sent into the forest in advance of the fowling season to observe
the state of the game. I cite the main part of this earlier description
Biggs’s version: “The hau of the forest has two ‘likenesses.’ 1. When
the forest is inspected by the observers, and if birds are observed to
be there, and if birds are killed by them that day, the first bird
killed by them is offered to the mauri. It is simply thrown away into
the bush, and is said, ‘that’s for the mauri. ’ The reason, lest they
get nothing in the future. 2. When the hunting is finished (they) go out
of the bush and begin to cook the birds for preserving in fat. Some are
set aside first to feed the hau of the forest; this is the forest hau.
Those birds which were set aside are cooked on the second fire. Only the
priests eat the birds of the second fire, Other birds are set aside for
the tapairu from which only the women eat. Most of the birds are set
aside and cooked on the puuraakau fire. The birds of the puuraakau fire
are for all to eat. . . . ” (cf. Best, 1909, pp. 438, 440–41, 449 f; and
for other details of the ceremonies, 1942, pp. 13, 184 f, 316–17).

11 And in Best’s translation, even reiterating: “Suppose that you
possess a certain article, and you give that article to me, without
price. We make no bargain over it.”

12 Firth cites the following discussion to this point from Gudgeon: “If
a man received a present and passed it on to some third person then
there is no impropriety in such an act; but if a return present is made
by the third party then it must be passed on to the original grantor or
it is a hau ngaro (consumed hau)” (Firth, 1959a, p. 418). The lack of
consequence in the first of these conditions is again evidence against
Mauss’s nostalgic hau, ever striving to return to its foyer.

13 Whitia is the past participle of whiti. Whiti, according to H.
Williams’s dictionary, means: (1) v.i., cross over, reach the opposite
side; (2) change, turn, to be inverted, to be contrary; (3) v.t., pass
through; (4) turn over, prise (as with a lever); (5) change (Williams,
1921, p. 584).

14 Best’s further interpretation lent itself to Mauss’s views: “For it
seems that that article of yours is impregnated with a certain amount of
your hau, which presumably passes into the article received in exchange
therefore, because if I pass that second article on to other hands it is
a hau whitia”(1900–1901, p. 198). Thus “it seems.” One has a feeling of
participating in a game of ethnographic folk-etymology, which we now
find, from Best’s explanation, is a quite probable game a quatre.

15 There is also, of course, a narrative bridge between the section on
transmission, of magic and the ceremony, as the former ends with the
placing of the mauri which is the key element of the latter.

16 Thus Mauss’s simple translation of hau as spirit and his view of
exchange as a lien d’âmes is at least imprecise. Beyond that, Best
repeatedly would like to distinguish hau (and mauri) from wairua on the
grounds that the former, which ceases to exist with death, cannot leave
a person’s body on pain of death, unlike wairua. But here Best finds
himself in difficulty with the material manifestation of a person’s hau
used in witchcraft, so that he is alternatively tempted to say that some
part of the hau can be detached from the body or that the hau as
witchcraft is not the “true” hau.

17 I use the Everyman’s edition for all citations from Leviathan (New
York: Dutton, 1950), as it retains the archaic spelling, rather than the
more commonly cited English Works edited by Molesworth (1839).

18 Why this should seem particularly so in Leviathan in comparison with
the earlier Elements of Law and De Cive becomes intelligible from
McNeilly’s recent analysis to the effect that Leviathan completes the
transformation of Hobbes’s argument into a formal rationality of
interpersonal relations (in the absence of a sovereign power), which
involves abandonment, as concerns the logic of argument, of the prior
stress on the content of human passions. Hence if in the early works,
“Hobbes attempts to derive political conclusions from certain (very
doubtful) propositions about the specific nature of individual human
beings . .. in Leviathan the argument depends on an analysis of the
formal structure of the relations between individuals” (McNeilly, 1968,
p. 5).

19 Mauss did note in certain transactions of the present day some
“funda-mental motives of human activity: emulation between individuals
of the same sex, that ‘deep- seated imperialism’ of men, at base part
social, part animal and psychological. . . .” (1966, pp. 258–259). On
the other hand, if as Macpherson (1965) argues, Hobbe’s conception of
human nature is just the bourgeois eternalized, then Mauss is squarely
opposed to it (1966, pp. 271–272).

20 Hobbes’s particular inability to conceive primitive society as such
is manifest by his assimilation of it, that is of the patriarchal
chiefdom, to the commonwealth. This is clear enough in the passages of
Leviathan on commonwealths by acquisition, but even more definitive in
the parallel sections of Elements of Law and De Cive. Thus, in the
latter: “A father with his sons and servants, grown into a civil person
by virtue of his paternal jurisdiction, is called a family. This family,
if through multiplying of children and acquisition of servants it
becomes numerous, insomuch as without casting the uncertain die of war
it cannot be subdued, will be termed an hereditary kingdom. Which though
it differ from an institutive monarchy, being acquired by force, in the
original and manner of its constitution; yet being constituted, it hath
all the same properties, and the right of authority is everywhere the
same; insomuch as it is not needful to speak anything of them apart”
(English Works [Molesworth, ed.], 1839, vol. 2, pp. 121–122).


5 On the Sociology of Primitive Exchange

1 For the present purpose,“economy” is viewed as the process of
provisioning society (or the “socio-cultural system”). No social
relation, institution, or set of institutions is of itself “economic.”
Any institution, say a family or a lineage order, if it has material
consequence for provisioning society can be placed in an economic
context and considered part of the economic process. The same
institution may be equally or more involved in the political process,
thus profitably considered as well in a political context. This way of
looking at economics or politics—or for that matter, religion,
education, and any number of other cultural processes—is dictated by the
nature of primitive culture. Here we find no socially distinct “economy”
or “govern-ment,” merely social groups and relations with multiple
functions, which we distinguish as economic, political, and so forth.

That economy thus presents itself as an aspect of things is probably
generally acceptable. That the emphasis be the provisioning of society
may not prove so acceptable. For the concern is not how individuals go
about their business: “economy” has not been defined as the application
of scarce available means against alternative ends (material ends or
otherwise). From means to end “economy” is conceived as a component of
culture rather than a kind of human action, the material life process of
society rather than a need-satisfying process of individual behavior.
Our purpose is not to analyze entrepreneurs but to compare cultures. We
reject the historically specific Business Outlook. In terms of
controversial positions recently developed in the American
Anthropologist, the stand adopted is much more with Dalton (1961; cf.
Sahlins, 1962) than with Burling (1962) or LeClair (1962). Also,
solidarity is here affirmed with housewives the world over and Professor
Malinowski. Professor Firth upbraids Malinowski’s imprecision on a point
of economic anthropology with the observation that “This is not the
terminology of economics, it is almost the language of the housewife”
(Firth, 1957, p. 220). The terminology of the present effort similarly
departs from economic orthodoxy. This may be justly considered a
necessity born of ignorance, but something is to be said as well for the
appropriateness, in a study of kinship economies, of the housewife’s
perspective.

2 Economy has been defined as the process of (materially) provisioning
society and the definition opposed to the human act of satisfying wants.
The great play of instrumental exchange in primitive societies
underscores the usefulness of the former definition. Sometimes the
peace-making aspect is so fundamental that precisely the same sorts and
amounts of stuff change hands: the renunciation of opposed interest is
in this way symbolized. On a strictly formal view the transaction is a
waste of time and effort. One might say that people are maximizing
value, social value, but such is to misplace the determinant of the
transaction, to fail to specify the circumstances which produce
different material outcomes in different historical instances, to hold
fast to the economizing premise of the market by a false assignment of
pecuniary-like qualities to social qualities, to take the high road to
tautology. The interest of such transactions is precisely that they do
not materially provision people and are not predicated on the
satisfaction of human material needs. They do, however, decidedly
provision society: they maintain social relations, the structure of
society, even if they do not to the least advantage the stock of
consumables. Without any further assumptions, they are “economic” in the
suggested meaning of the term (cf. Sahlins, 1969).

3 The reader familiar with recent discussions of primitive distribution
will recognize my indebtedness to Polanyi (1944, 1957, 1959) on this
score, and likewise the departures from Polanyi’s terminology and
threefold scheme of principles of integration. It is also a pleasure to
affirm with Firth that “Every student of primitive economics, in fact,
gratefully builds upon the foundations which Malinowski has laid”
(Firth, 1959, p. 174).

4 Since the original publication of this essay, Lévi-Strauss’s “échange
généralisé” has become much more current than our “generalized
reciprocity.” This is only unfortunate because the two do not refer to
the same type (let alone the same universe) of reciprocity. Besides,
friends and critics have suggested various alternatives to “generalized
reciprocity,” such as “indefinite reciprocity,” etc. The time for
beating a terminological retreat may be near; but for the moment, I am
holding on.


6 Exchange Value and the Diplomacy of Primitive Trade

1 I do not attempt here a general theory of value. The principal concern
is exchange value. By the “exchange value” of a good (A), I mean the
quantity of other goods (B, C, etc.) received in return for it—as in the
famous couplet “The value of a thing/Is just as much as it will bring.”
For the historical economies in question, it remains to be seen whether
this “exchange value” approximates the Ricardian-Marxist “value,” the
average social labor embodied in the product. Were it not for the
ambiguity introduced by spheres of exchange in assigning goods different
relative standing, the term “relative value” might be more acceptable
all around than “exchange value”; where the context allows, I substitute
the former term. “Price” is reserved for exchange value expressed in
money terms.

2 “The Manus . .. most disadvantageously placed of all the tribes in
that part of the archipelago, are nevertheless the richest and have the
highest standard of living” (Mead, 1937, p. 212).

3 Local demand in the Manus trade system is indicated by an unusual
device. In Manus transactions with Balowan, where sago is scarce, one
package of sago offered by Manus will bring ten mud hen’s eggs from
Balowan; but the equivalent of a package of sago offered by Manus to
Balowan in shell money commands only three mud hen’s eggs. (Clearly if
the Manus anywhere can convert these several items they make a killing.)
Similarly, in Manus daily trade with Usiai land people, demand is
indicated by unequal ratios of the following sort: one fish from Manus
for ten taro or forty betel nut from Usiai; whereas one cup of lime from
Manus for four taro or eighty betel nut from Usiai. Mead comments:
“Betel-chewing need is matched against betel chewing need, to coerce the
sea people [Manus] into providing lime for the land peoples” (Mead,
1930, p. 130). That is to say, when the Usiai want lime, they offer
betel nut, as the Manus can realize more betel in exchange for lime than
for fish; if Usiai wanted fish, they would have brought taro. On the
labor advantage to Manus in this trade, and the gains appreciated
through supply/ demand variations in different parts of the Manus
network, see Schwartz, 1963, pp. 75, 78.

4 I cannot however verify these assertions; in the event they prove
invalid, certain suggestions of the following paragraphs will require
modification.

5 Cash has particularly replaced the pigs’ tusks traditionally traded
for Tami bowls, corresponding to a replacement of the latter by European
currency in the brideprices of the Finschhafen area.

6 Belshaw reports a trade system in the southern Massim apparently
similar in exchange value conditions to the Huon Gulf (1955, pp. 28–29,
81–82). He notes, however, that rates of certain items—areca nuts, pots,
and stick tobacco—do vary locally with demand. I may not fully
understand his argument, which is phrased in shilling equivalents, but
what it seems to show, when taken in conjunction with the published
table of exchange ratios (pp. 82–83), is that values of these goods in
terms of each other reflect respective supply and demand in the southern
Massim as a whole, not that their exchange values vary locally from
place to place (except perhaps in modern shilling deals). A particular
good would command more or less of another, depending on the global
supply/demand, but whatever the ratio in one place it is the same in
another. The published tables seem to indicate fairly uniform customary
exchange rates: for example, one pot is traded for one “bunch” or one
“bundle” of areca nuts at several locations (Tubetube, Bwasilake, Milne
Bay), whereas two sticks of tobacco are given for one “bunch” of areca
at Sudest and one pot for two sticks of tobacco at Sumarai (pp. 81–82).

7 Thus Huon Gulf goods may well pass through Tami into the Siassi–New
Britain area, but probably under different trade terms, for the Tami
islanders act as middlemen in a part of this area, very like the Siassi
and probably also to some net advantage.

8 In speaking of short-term sluggishness in the face of supply and
demand unbalance, it is necessary to bear in mind that the reference is
to customary rates, especially if the economy includes a sector of
haggling. Bargaining proceeds from various degrees of desperation and
advantage, personal positions that do not individually represent the
aggregate supply and demand and result in marked differences from
transaction to transaction in rates of exchange. In Marshall’s terms,
bargainers can come to an equilibrium, but only fortituitously to the
equilibirum (1961, pp. 791–793). Unless and until other people get into
the bargaining, both on the demand side and the supply side, such paired
haggling does not constitute a “market principle” nor influence price in
the way envisioned by the competitive model. Certain ethnographic
suggestions that prices in one or another primitive society are even
more responsive to supply/demand than in our markets, insofar as they
derive from the haggling sector, ought to be treated with suspicion. In
any event, these kinds of fluctuations are not involved in the present
discussion of short-term stability.

9 Or else the trade of their respective communities is arranged between
representative chiefs, who redistribute the proceeds within their
groups, for example, certain Pomo trade (Loeb, 1926, pp. 192–193), or in
the Marquesas (Linton, 1939, p. 147). On corporate partnerships between
groups, see below.

10 Oliver provides an example from Siuai of the difficulty of trade—even
between people of the same ethnic group—in the absence of partnership:
“It is not a simple matter to purchase a pig. Owners become fond of
their beasts and are often loath to give them up. A would-be purchaser
cannot merely let it be known that he is interested in buying, and then
sit at home and await orders.. . . One situation was observed in which a
hopeful purchaser visited a potential seller every day for nine days
before finally concluding the transaction: all for a [small] pig worth
20 spans of mauai! It is no wonder, then, that institutionalized
arrangements have developed whereby acquiring a pig becomes simplified.
One of these is the taovu [trade partner] relationship already
described” (Oliver, 1955, p. 350).

11 “. .. it is a serious offense [among the Sio of northeast New Guinea]
to steal or to attempt to lure away another person’s trade-friend. In
the old days, a man would attempt to kill an errant trade-friend as well
as his new partner” (Harding, 1967, pp. 166–167). The following also
suggests competitive impotence in trade: “One Komba man [an inland
tribe] who is esteemed for his generosity complained that some Sio
[trade-] friends were being intentionally impolite to him. He was very
offended: ‘They want me to visit [that is, exchange with] them, but I am
only one man. What do they want me to do, cut off my arms and legs and
distribute them around?’ ” (p. 168).

12 Again, as bargained rates, auctioned rates are indeterminate and are
unlikely to indicate the equilibrium. Aiston writes of the Australian
pitcheri narcotic auction: “Intrinsic value had nothing to do with the
sales; it was quite likely that a big bag of pitcheri would be exchanged
for a single boomerang, but it was just as likely to be exchanged for
half a dozen boomerangs and perhaps a shield and a pirra; it always
depended on what the buyer and seller wanted; sometimes when the seller
had as much as he could carry he would give a bag in exchange for food
for his party (1936–37, pp. 376–377).

13 Or at least I have not construed any definite or general covert price
competition. There is one form of trade that possibly admits it—certain
of the so-called “markets” or “market meetings” in Melanesia. This
arrangement, of which Blackwood (1935) provides several examples, might
reasonably be considered a corporate trade partnership between
communities, the members of which meet at traditional places and
prearranged times, and are free to trade with any opposite number who
shows up. The trade is in customary products, is regulated by customary
rates of equivalence, and customarily proceeds without haggle—and little
enough of any talk. Blackwood did see one woman try to get more than the
customary rate for a load of her produce—i.e., try to haggle—but she was
foiled (1935, p. 440). There remains, however, the choice of particular
partners and inspection of the goods offered; although hawking is not
indicated, it is conceivable that women of a side compete with each
other by varying the quantity or quality of their “standard” loads (cf.
Blackwood, 1935, p. 443, on variations of certain loads).

One other possibility of implicit competition, more general than this,
is discussed further along in the text.

Furthermore, there are two rather exceptional conditions of trade on
which we have already put a construction of business-like competition.
One was the mixed economy (Kapauku), combining bargaining and balanced
reciprocity sectors whose differences in rates presumably would incline
people, insofar as social relations permit, to withhold goods from one
sector for the better returns available in the other. Or again, as in
the Huon Gulf, two or more villages may handle the same good, and other
communities have access to more than one of these suppliers. The
marketlike effect in both cases would be equalization of rates over the
different sectors or communities. But this interpretation does not solve
the critical problems. How is the trend of indeterminate rates in the
bargaining sector transposed to the customary rates of balanced
partnership exchange, such that the latter too realize the influence of
supply/demand? Likewise, in trade networks competitively patterned at
the community level, it remains difficult to understand just how
relative value is adjusted to supply and demand. For exchange still is
conducted at customary rates between pairs of customary partners.

14 Interesting that Marx reproached Proudhon for the same mistake: “Il
ne suffit pas, à M. Proudhon, d’avoir éliminé du rapport de l’offre et
de la demande les éléments dont nous venons de parler. Il pousse
l’abstraction aux dernières limites, en fondant tous les producteurs en
un seul producteur, tous les consommateurs en un seul consommateur, et
en établissant la lutte entre ces deux personnages chimériques. Mais
dans le monde réel les choses se passent autrement. La concurrence entre
ceux qui offrent et la concurrence entre ceux qui demandent, forment un
élément nécessaire de la lutte entre les acheteurs et les vendeurs, d’òu
résulte la valeur venale” (Marx, 1968 [1847], pp. 53–54).

15 “While trading, Indians won’t hand a foreigner both the bow and the
arrows at the same time” (Goldschmidt, 1951, p. 336).

16 Cf. Malinowski, 1922, p. 188 on the unbalances in fish–yam exchange
between partners of different Trobriand villages. For other examples of
trade partner good measure in reciprocation see also Oliver, 1955, pp.
229, 546; Spencer, 1959, p. 169; cf. Goldschmidt, 1951, p. 335.

17 Further, it appears the empirical case that a discrepancy in labor
values can be sustained by an equivalence in utilities (cf. Godelier,
1969). “Need” is matched to “need,” perhaps at the real expense of one
party—although, as we have seen, the norm of equal work may still be
maintained by ideological ruse and pretense. This kind of discrepancy
would be most likely where the goods traded belong to different spheres
of exchange within one or both trading communities, for example,
manufactured goods for food, especially where the craft goods are used
also in such as bridewealth payments. Then the high social utility of a
small amount of one good (the manufactured good) is compensated by a
large quantity of the item of lesser status. This may be an important
secret in the “exploitation” of richer areas by poorer (e.g., Siassi).

18 The misunderstanding is cultural and economic, obviously independent
of race and religion: “ . .. Nuer do not regard purchase from an Arab
merchant in the way in which we regard purchase from a shop. It is not
to them an impersonal transaction, and they have no idea of price and
currency in our sense. Their idea of purchase is that you give something
to a merchant who is thereby put under an obligation to help you. At the
same time you ask him for something you need from his shop and he ought
to give it to you because, by taking your gift, he has entered into a
reciprocal relationship with you. Hence kok has the sense of ‘to buy’ or
‘to sell.’ The two acts are an expression of a single relationship of
reciprocity. As an Arab merchant regards the transaction rather
differently misunderstandings arise. In the Nuer way of looking at the
matter what is involved in an exchange of this kind is a relation
between persons rather than between things. It is the merchant who is
‘bought’ rather than the goods.. . .” (Evans-Pritchard, 1956, pp.
223–224).
