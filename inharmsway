[The women and men who testified at the hearings, whose voices speak
from these pages, and the gifted organizers in each city, who brought it
all into public light, have our gratitude. What they did made our work
possible. Of the many who worked so hard and gave so much, those whose
contributions are especially memorable are Meg Baldwin, Jeanne Barkey,
Karen E. Davis, Charlee Hoyt, Steve Jevning, Dorchen Leidholdt, Annie
McCombs, Sharon Sayles-Belton, Therese Stanton, Diane Stoltenberg, John
Stoltenberg, Van White, Gail Abarbanel, Sandy Mullins, Myra Riddell,
Betty Rosenstein, Beulah Coughenour, Deborah Daniels, Steve Goldsmith,
William Hudnut, Rhea Becker, Gail Dines, Lierre Keith, Amy Elman, and
Barbara Findlen.]{.font4}

[Without Valerie Harper's timely intervention, there would be no record
of the Minneapolis hearings. David Satz's computerized version allowed
the Minneapolis hearings to be passed hand to hand in photocopy for many
years. Rhea Becker, Ann Russo, and Lierre Keith saved the Massachusetts
hearings from probable oblivion. Sarah Zeller and Emily M. Lindell
helped locate documents. Rita Rendell\'s skillful and tireless
assistance made this volume possible. The proofreading of Kaethe Hoffer,
with the help of Pamela Shifman and Leslie Bell, and of Christopher N.
Kendall and Lila Lee, made it more accurate. We take responsibility for
the contents.]{.font4}

[Lindsay Waters at Harvard University Press published these hearings,
ending almost fifteen years of their effective suppression. We thank him
wholeheartedly.]{.font4}

[]{#noteEditing.xhtml}

[]{#noteEditing.xhtml#bookmark0}[Note on the Editing]{.font6 .sgc-1}

[These hearings are based on transcripts of oral testimony. The
Minneapolis hearings were transcribed live by a court reporter,
Kimberley Kramer of Janet Shaddix, Inc. The Indianapolis hearings were
transcribed from an official but incomplete videotape. The Los Angeles
and Massachusetts hearings were transcribed from audio tapes. Ellipses
mark removal of anything that was said. Brackets indicate any other
editorial alteration, such as correction, substitution, or addition.
Editorial comment is confined to footnotes.]{.font4}

[We intend these hearings to be as complete and accurate a record of
what was said as possible. The excised material consists of some small
talk, pleasantries, arrangements (for instance, scheduling), and
legislative minutiae that is frankly incoherent when written down.
Exhibits and written submissions, by contrast, are highly selected.
Exhibits are renumbered consecutively, with original numbers or letters
in brackets. Books, letters, and briefs, originally submitted whole, are
excerpted. Internal citations in documents are not updated. For reasons
of space, since Catharine MacKinnon spoke in all four hearings, much of
her Indianapolis testimony (on the Minneapolis hearings and specific
proposed amendments) is removed, as is testimony by Deborah Daniels that
duplicated information testified to elsewhere. Not a word of testimony
by opponents to the ordinances has been cut.]{.font4}

[All survivors who testified were fully identified to the bodies before
whom they spoke, unless they state otherwise on the record. For this
volume, each survivor chose an identification. Those who could not be
relocated to make this choice are identified by their initials. Some
proper names had to be transcribed phonetically and have not been able
to be further verified, despite our efforts. We apologize to anyone
whose name is misspelled.]{.font4}

[Women speak in public for the first time in history of the harms done
to them through pornography in the hearings collected in this volume.
Their first-person accounts stand against the pervasive sexual violation
of women and children that is allowed to be done in private and is not
allowed to be criticized in public. Their publication, which comes
almost fifteen years^1^ after the first hearing was held, ends the
exclusion from the public record of the information they contain on the
way pornography works in social reality. Now ended is the censorship of
these facts and voices from a debate on the social and cultural role of
pornography that has gone on as if it could go on without them.]{.font4}

[Until these hearings took place, pornography and its apologists largely
set the terms of public discussion over pornography's role in social
life. Public, available, effectively legal, pornography has stature: it
is visible, credible, and legitimated. At the same time, its influence
and damaging effects are denied as nonexistent, indeterminate, or merely
academic, contrary to all the evidence. Its victims have had no stature
at all. The hearings changed the terms of this discussion by opening a
space to speak ]{.font4}[for the real authorities on pornography: the
casualties of its making and use. Against a background of claims that
the victims and the harms done to them do not exist, must not be
believed, and should not be given a legal hearing, the harms of
pornography stood exposed and took shape as potential legal injuries.
These hearings were the moment when the voices of those victimized
through pornography broke the public surface. Their publication gives
the public unmediated and unrestricted access to this direct evidence
for the first time. The authority of their experience makes the harm of
pornography undeniable: it harmed them.]{.sgc-4}

[In late 1983, legislators in Minneapolis initiated this process^2^ by
employing Andrea Dworkin and me to write a law for the city that we had
conceived on pornography as a human rights violation. Other
jurisdictions followed, including Indianapolis, Los Angeles County, and
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,^3^ each seeking to adapt our civil
rights approach to local concerns. All these laws recognized the
concrete violations of civil rights done through pornography as
practices of sex discrimination^4^ and gave the survivors access to
civil court for relief through a law they could use themselves. The
hearings that resulted from the introduction of the legislation gave
pornography's survivors a forum, an audience, and a concrete opportunity
to affect their world. Grasping the real chance that rights might be
given to them, seeing that their participation could make a difference
to the conditions of their lives, these women and men became prepared to
run the risks of this political expression. The consequences anticipated
at that time included public humiliation and shame, shunning and
ostracism, loss of employment, threats, harassment, and physical
assault.]{.font4}

[The act of introducing the antipornography civil rights ordinances into
the legislative arena gave pornography's victims back some measure of
the dignity and hope that the pornography, with its pervasive social and
legal support, takes away. The ordinances, in formulating pornography's
harms as human rights deprivations, captured a denigrated reality of
women's experience in a legal form that affirmed that to be treated in
these ways violates a human being; it does not simply reveal and define
what a woman is. As ending these violations and holding their
perpetrators accountable became imaginable for the first time, and women
participated directly in making the rules that govern their lives, the
disgrace of being socially female---fit only for sexual use, unfit for
human life--- was exposed as a pimp's invention. In these hearings,
women were citizens.]{.font4}

[The first-person testimony, contextualized by expert witnesses as
representative rather than unique or isolated, documented the material
harm pornography does in the real world, showing the view that
pornography is harmless fantasy to be as false as it is cliched. Women
used for sex so that pornography can be made of them against their
will---from Linda "Lovelace"^5^ forced to fellate men so Deep Throat
could be made to a young girl sold as sex to Hustler\'s "Beaverhunt"^6^
to Valerie Harper's face on another woman's naked body on a
T-shirt^7^---refute the assumption promoted by the pornography industry
that women are in pornography because they want to be there. The
information provided by these witnesses also underlines the simplest
fact of the visual materials: to be made, the acts in them had to be
done to someone. A few who have escaped the sex factories describe the
forms of force required.]{.font4}

[Woman after woman used by consumers of pornography recounts its causal
role in her sexual violation by a man close to her. A husband forces
pornography on his wife and uses it to pressure her into sex acts she
does not want.^8^ A father threatens his children with pornography so
they will keep silent about what he shows them is being done, audibly,
to their mother at night. ^9^ A brother holds up pornography magazines
as his friends gang-rape his sister, making her assume the poses in the
materials, turning her as they turn the pages. ^10^ A woman's boyfriend
becomes aroused by watching other women being used in pornography and
forces sexual access. ^11^ A gay man inflicts the abusive sex learned
through using pornography on his male lover, who tolerates it because he
learned from pornography that a man's violence is the price of his love.
^12^]{.font4}

[Although intimate settings provide privileged access for these acts,
such violations occur throughout social life. White male motorists,
spewing racist bile, rape a Native American woman at a highway rest stop
in reenactment of a pornographic video game. ^13^ Working men plaster
women's crotches on the walls of workplaces. ^14^ Therapists force
pornography on clients. ^15^ Pimps use pornography to train and trap
child prostitutes.^16^ Men who buy and use women and children for sex
bring pornography to show those prostituted what the men want them to
do. ^17^ Pornography is made of prostituted children to threaten them
with exposure to keep them in prostitution.^18^ Serial sexual murderers
use pornography to prepare and impel them to rape and kill.^19^]{.font4}

[Grounded in these realities, the ordinance that produced and resulted
from the hearings provides civil access to court to prove the abuse and
the role of pornography in it in each situation. The ordinance , with
local variations, provides a cause of action to individuals who are
coerced in to pornography, forced to consume pornography, defamed by
being used in pornography without consent, assaulted due to specific
pornography, or subordinated as a member of a sex-based group through
traffic in pornography as legally defined.^20^ The chance to prove in
court the harmful role of pornography in each situation is what
pornography's victims have sought. This, to date, is what they have been
denied.]{.font4}

[The opponents of the civil rights laws against pornography are amply
represented in the hearings. They did not openly defend pornography as
such, ^21^ or address the harms the witnesses document even to deny
them. They treat the survivors as if they are not there or do not
matter. That those victimized by pornography are lying or expendable is
the upshot of the First Amendment defense of pornography that the
opponents do present, proceeding as if the "speech" of violation matters
over the violation of the violated. Some opponents adopt the view that
any factual disputes over the harm should not be resolved in court---in
other words, that whatever harm may exist can be debated so long as the
debate is endless, but the harm can never be stopped. As the
Massachusetts hearing shows, the issue of whether pornography is harmful
matters to pornography's defenders only as long as it is considered
impossible to demonstrate that harm. Once it is judicially established
that pornography does the harms made actionable in this law---as it was
established in the litigation on the ordinance in 1985^22^---the
ordinance's opponents lose interest in the question.]{.font4}

[Addressed not at all by the opposition in the hearings is whether or
not the practices of pornography made actionable by the ordinance are
properly conceptualized as sex-based discrimination. Like the conclusion
that pornography causes harm, the conclusion on the nature of that harm
is based on evidence, on fact; these hearings provide those facts. As an
analytic matter, although many people are shown to be victimized,
actually and potentially, if even one woman, man, or child is victimized
because of their sex, as a member of a group defined by sex, that person
is discriminated against on the basis of sex; those who testified to
their experiences in the hearings incontestably were hurt as members of
their gender. Their specifically, differentially, and uncontestedly
sex-based injuries ground the state's interest in equality that is
vindicated by the ordinance.]{.font4}

[The hearings show the ordinance in practice: it produced them. The
hearings also present case after case of precisely the kinds of evidence
the ordinance would introduce into court if it were enacted into law.
These are the people who need to use it, who have nothing to use without
it. The hearings empowered individuals to speak in public, provided a
forum for them to confront their abusers, to prove their violations, and
to secure accountability and relief, as the ordinance would in court.
The hearings present witnesses to acts of abuse and injury---acts, not
ideas, like those acts the ordinance would redress in court. In the
hearings, the industry of exploitation and violence that produced these
acts is connected inextricably with them, as it would also have to be in
civil court proceedings. The hearings challenged the same concentration
of nongovernmental power that the ordinance would challenge in court,
empowering the government no more than the hearings did. The hearings
used the legislative process for the ends to which it is given to
citizens to use, as the ordinance would use the civil judicial process
to its designed purposes of conflict resolution and rectification of
injury. As the ordinance would in court, the hearings brought
pornography out of a half-lit underground into the public light of day.
The hearings freed previously suppressed speech. So would the ordinance.
Neither the ordinance nor the hearings have anything in common with
censorship.^23^]{.font4}

[Until the publication of this volume, the public discussion of
pornography has been impoverished and deprived by often inaccurate or
incomplete reports of victims' accounts and experts' views.^24^ Media
reports of victims' testimony at the time of the hearings themselves
were often cursory, distorted, or nonexistent. Some reports by
journalists covering the Minneapolis hearings were rewritten by editors
to conform the testimony to the story of pornography's harmlessness that
they wanted told.^25^ Of this process, one Minneapolis reporter assigned
to cover those hearings told me, in reference to the reports she filed,
"I have never been so censored in my life. " Thus weakened, the victim
testimony became easier to stigmatize as emotional and to dismiss as
exceptional. Its representativeness has been further undermined by
selective or misleading reports of expert testimony on scientific
studies. This body of scholarship predicts that the precise kinds of
consequences will happen from exposure to pornography that the survivors
report did happen in their own experience. In making the whole record
available, this book shows these two kinds of evidence documenting the
same harm in two different ways.]{.font4}

[This volume contributes other neglected or otherwise inaccessible
information to the public discussion over the civil rights ordinance
against pornography. For example, the allegation that opposing points of
view were excluded from the hearings by the bills' proponents^26^ is
refuted by the hearings on their face. Opponent after opponent of the
civil rights of women, mostly liberals, parade through these pages,
testifying ad nauseam. The hearings also go some distance toward
refuting the now ubiquitous fabrication that locates the engine of the
civil rights antipornography ordinances in an "unusual coalition of
radical feminists and conservative women politicians. "^27^ This
invention originated in a false report in The New York Times that
Charlee Hoyt, one of the bill's original sponsors in Minneapolis,
opposed the Equal Rights Amendment. The Times published a correction
affirming Hoyt's constant support of ERA, but the lie about the
ordinance's alliance with the right stuck, always changing ground but
always growing.^28^ The same Times article stated that the Indianapolis
ordinance was passed with "the support of the Rev. Greg Dixon, a former
Moral Majority official, " who "packed Council hearings to lobby for
passage of the proposed ordinance. "^29^ Neither Rev. Dixon nor his
followers appear to have spoken at the Indianapolis hearings. Enough
votes for passage (the bill passed 24 to 5) existed prior to the meeting
at which these individuals sat in the audience. No one has said that
Rev. Dixon or his group had any other contact with the process. Thus it
was that the outcome of a legislative vote came to be attributed to the
presence of some who came to watch as others cast it.]{.font4}

[Taint through innuendo has substituted for fact and analysis in much
reporting and discussion of the ordinance. As the hearings document, of
all the sponsors of the bill in all the cities in which it has been
introduced, only one---Beulah Coughenour of Indianapolis---has been
conservative. Work on one bill with an independent individual is hardly
an alliance with a political wing.^30^ And exactly what is sinister
about women uniting with women across conventional political lines
against a form of abuse whose politics are sexual has remained
unspecified by the critics.]{.font4}

[The hearings correct such widely distorted facts simply by showing the
sponsors and supporters of the ordinance in action, illustrating its
progressive politics. The ordinance's two original sponsors in
Minneapolis appear: Van White, a liberal Democratic African American
man, and Charlee Hoyt, a liberal Republican white woman. (Sharon Sayles
Belton, the Democratic African American woman who is now mayor of
Minneapolis, sponsored the reintroduced ordinance after the first veto.
) The grass-roots groups who inspired the Minneapolis ordinance by
requesting help in their fight against pornographers' invasion of their
neighborhoods testify in support of it. These same groups later
supported the Indianapolis ordinance when it was challenged in
court.^31^ Battered women's groups, rape crisis center workers and
advocates, organizations of survivors of sexual abuse in childhood, and
groups of former prostitutes present unanimous evidence from their
experience in favor of the ordinance. They, too, supported it against
later legal challenge.^32^ The large, ethnically diverse Los Angeles
County Commission on Women that sponsored and supported the ordinance
chaired the hearings there.]{.font4}

[The progression of hearings reveals that opposition to the ordinance
became better organized over time, its strategy refined. In the Los
Angeles hearing on April 22, 1985, in which the pro-pimp lobby remained
as always centered in the American Civil Liberties Union, the woman card
was first played. There, a tiny, noisy elite of women who defend
pornography professionally contrast with survivor after survivor whom
they talk past and disregard---a division of a few women from all women
subsequently magnified by a gleeful press. There, women's material
interest in pornography was presented as divided: if it hurts some
women, other women love it, and stopping it hurts women more. ^33^ Women
against women subsequently became the pornographers' tactic of choice,
as if women's oppression by pornography had been argued to be
biological, as if biological females saying they were not hurt by it
undercut that case. This choice of strategy was revealed in the
orchestration of the ordinance referendum battle in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, in November 1985, in which the ordinance narrowly lost,
and even more graphically in evidence in the Boston, Massachusetts,
hearing of March 1992. In Boston, speaking almost entirely through
female mouthpieces, the corporate interests of the entertainment
industry came out of the woodwork for the first time weighing in on the
side of the pornography industry, arraying abstraction after evasion
after obfuscation after self-interested, profit-oriented rationalization
against survivors' simple, direct accounts of the role of pornography in
their abuse. ^34^ Much of the media persistently position women against
women in their coverage, employing the pornographers' strategy in the
way they report events and frame issues for public discussion.
Corrective letters showing wide solidarity among women on the ordinance
are routinely not published. ^35^]{.font4}

[These hearings took place in public and on the record. The witnesses,
unless they say otherwise, were fully identified to the governmental
bodies before whom they testified. Some of the consequences to them show
why it has taken so long and has been so hard to make this information
public, and prefigure the onslaught that followed. Some of those who
spoke in Minneapolis were hounded and punished for what they said. One
woman's testimony was published by Penthouse Forum without her knowledge
or permission, selling her assault for sexual use. A copy of
Penthouse\'s pages with "We're going to get you, squaw" scrawled across
it in red appeared in her mailbox. A dead rabbit appeared there a few
days later; she was telephoned repeatedly by a man who appeared to be
watching her in her home. Another witness was subsequently telephoned
night after night at her unlisted telephone number: "The calls are not
simply harassing phone calls. It is like someone is reading something
out\' of the pornography books\... we can't get away from it."^36^ These
are techniques of terror.]{.font4}

[By bringing forward festering human pain that had been denied, the
hearings unleashed an explosion of reports by women and men desperate
for help. A local organizing group formed after the Minneapolis hearing
was deluged with them. Women told "about the time their boyfriend
urinated on them while using pornography depicting 'golden showers.
'"^37^ Rape victims reported that "their attacker took pictures during
the rape and that she's afraid he is going to sell and distribute them.
"^38^ The group reported that "we have received a call from a man in
Fort Collins, Colorado, terrified because a group of men were holding
him captive and making pornography with him. He has called and sent us
the pornography in hopes that it could be used as evidence, that the
whip lashes would prove that he was forced."^39^ Some groups held more
hearings. The National Organization for Women hosted testimony on
pornography across the nation. ^40^]{.font4}

[The Minneapolis hearings, circulated in photocopied transcript hand to
hand, had a substantial impact on consciousness, politics, scholarship,
theory, and policy. ^41^ At the federal level, the first explosion of
publicity surrounding the Minneapolis hearings revived a long-moribund
proposal for a new national commission on pornography. Attorney General
William French Smith created the Attorney General's Commission on
Obscenity and Pornography and selected its members. The prior Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography in 1970, appointed by President Nixon, had
exonerated "obscenity" and "erotica" of a role in "crime, " looking at
no violent materials and looking for only violent effects.^42^ The
President's Commission heard from not a single direct victim---offended
moralists are not victims---and considered only evidence from "experts,
" meaning academics, on the question of harm. Understanding that asking
the wrong questions of the wrong people might have produced the wrong
answers, the Attorney General's Commission took extensive testimony from
scores of survivors of all kinds of real abuse and investigated the
effects of violent as well as nonviolent sexual materials. In other
words, it investigated what those on the receiving end were in a
position to know about the materials that are actually made and marketed
by the pornography industry and consumed by its users. This commission
was later named "the Meese Commission" by a hostile press in order to
discredit it by association with an almost universally despised man who
did announce the inquiry's formation but did not originate it and did
virtually nothing with its results.]{.font4}

[The]{.font4} [Final Report]{.font4} [of the Attorney General's
Commission, which repeatedly footnoted the Minneapolis hearings,
substantially adopted the civil rights approach in its approach,
findings, and recommendations. The report included an entire chapter on
harm to "performers"---of all survivors, the most ignored and, when
noticed, blamed. It found that "the harms at which the ordinance is
aimed are real and the need for a remedy for those harms is pressing.
"^43^ It concluded that "civil and other remedies ought to. be available
to those who have been in some way injured in the process of producing
these materials. "^44^ It endorsed a limited concept of civil remedies.
^45^ It found that the civil rights approach "is the only legal tool
suggested to the Commission which is specifically designed to provide
direct relief to the victims of the injuries so exhaustively documented
in our hearings throughout the country. "^46^ The Commission also agreed
that pornography, as made actionable in the ordinance, "constitutes a
practice of discrimination on the basis of sex." ^47^ In an embrace of
the ordinance's specific causes of action as well as its approach, the
Commission recommended that Congress "consider legislation affording
protection to those individuals whose civil rights have been violated by
the production or distribution of pornography\... At a minimum, claims
could be provided against trafficking, coercion, forced viewing,
defamation, and assault, reaching the industry as necessary to remedy
these abuses. "^48^ Unable to find constitutional a legal definition of
pornography that did not duplicate the existing obscenity definition,
the Commission nonetheless found itself "in substantial agreement with
the motivations behind the ordinance, and with the goals it represents.
"^49^]{.font4}

[In the years soon following the Commission's Report, parts of the
ordinance were introduced as bills in Congress. Senator Arlen Specter
introduced a version of the ordinance's coercion provision as the
Pornography Victims' Protection Act, making the coercion of an adult or
the use of a child to make pornography civilly actionable. ^50^ Senator
Mitch McConnell introduced a rendition of the ordinance's assault
provision as the Pornography Victims' Compensation Act, creating a civil
action for assault or murder caused by pornography. ^51^ Most
stunningly, Congress in 1994 adopted the Violence Against Women Act,
providing a federal civil remedy for gender-based acts of violence such
as rape and battering.^52^ In so doing, Congress made legally real its
understanding that sexual violation is a practice of sex discrimination,
the legal approach that the antipornography civil rights ordinance
pioneered in legislative form.]{.font4}

[More broadly, the exposure of pornography's harms has moved the ground
under social theory across a wide range of issues. The place of sex in
speech, including literature and art, and its role in social action has
been thrown open to reconsideration, historically and in the present.
The implications of visual and verbal presentation and representation
for the creation and distribution of social power---the relation between
the way people are imaged and imagined to the ways they are
treated---are being rethought. The buying and selling of human flesh in
the form of pornography has given scholarship on slavery a new
dimension. More has been learned about the place of sexuality in
ideology and about the importance of sexual pleasure to the exercise of
dominant power. The hearings are fertile ground for analyzing the role
of visceral belief in inequality and inferiority in practical systems of
discrimination, and of the role of denial of inequality in maintaining
that inequality. The cultural legitimation of sexual force, including
permission for and exoneration of rape and transformation of sexual
abuse into sexual pleasure and identity, is being newly interrogated.
New human rights theories are being built to respond to the human rights
violations unearthed. As events that have been hidden come to light, the
formerly unseen appears to determine more and more of the seen. The
repercussions for theory, the requisite changes in thinking on all
levels of society, have only begun to be felt.]{.font4}

[For those who survived pornography, the hearings were like coming up
for air. Now the water has closed over their heads once again. The
ordinance is not law anywhere. Mayor Donald Fraser of Minneapolis vetoed
it twice after passage by two different city councils. Minneapolis has
dithered and done nothing to this day. The Indianapolis ordinance was
declared unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit in a decision that inverted First Amendment law, saying that the
harm of pornography only proved the importance of protecting it as
speech, and reduced equality rights, by comparison, to a constitutional
nullity.^53^ The U. S. Supreme Court summarily affirmed this result
without hearing arguments, reading briefs, or issuing an opinion, ^54^
using a now largely obsolete legal device for upholding a ruling without
expressing a view on its reasoning.^55^ Although the Seventh Circuit
decision is wrong in law, ^56^ and the summary affirmance of it need not
necessarily bind subsequent courts, the ordinance passed in Bellingham,
Washington, by public referendum was invalidated by a federal court
there, citing the Indianapolis decision as controlling.^57^ The Los
Angeles ordinance was narrowly defeated, 3 to 2, in a vote delayed in
order to be as inconspicuous as possible. The Massachusetts ordinance
was maneuvered behind the scenes out of coming to a vote at all.
Senators Specter and McConnell compromised their bills
fundamentally.^58^ Neither bill---for all the purported political
expediency of their sponsors in gutting them as tools against the
pornography industry---passed or even made it out of committee.]{.font4}

[The victims have been betrayed. To adapt George Eliot's words, "that
roar which lies on the other side of silence"^59^ about sexual violation
in the ordinary lives of women was heard in these hearings. Now society
knows what is being done to the victims and has decided to turn away,
close its mind, and, "well wadded with stupidity, "^60^ go back to
masturbating to the violation of their human rights. The debate over
pornography that was reconfigured by the survivors' testimony to make
harm to women indispensable to the discussion has increasingly regressed
to its old right/left morality/freedom rut, making sexual violence
against women once again irrelevant and invisible.^61^ Politicians are
too cowed by the media even to introduce the bill. Truth be told, for
survivor and expert both, it has become more difficult than it was
before to speak out against pornography, as those in these hearings did.
The consequences are now known to include professional shunning and
blacklisting, attacks on employment and publishing, deprivation of
research and grant funding, public demonization, litigation and threats
of litigation, and physical assault. ^62^ The holy rage of the
pornographers at being publicly exposed, legalized through ACLU lawyers
at every bend in the road and accompanied by the relentless beat of
media lies, has made aggression against pornography's critics normative
and routine, fighting back unseemly, seemingly impossible. The silencing
is intentional, and it is effective. In this atmosphere, few stand up
and say what they know.]{.font4}

[The concerted attacks on anyone who dares to give even a respectful
hearing to the critique of pornography from this point of view has been
reminiscent of the left's vicious treatment of so-called "premature
antifascists" during the period of the Hitler-Stalin pact, or of those
who questioned Stalin including after the Moscow Trials. In the
establishment today, support or at least tolerance for pornography, if
slightly shaken, remains an article of faith among liberals and
libertarians alike. The liberal establishment is its chief bastion but
the right is actively complicit, its moralistic decency crusades and
useless obscenity laws protecting pornography while pretending to stop
it, contributing its share of judicial and other misogynists to the
ranks of pornography's defenders, forever defending private
concentrations of power and mistaking money for speech.]{.font4}

[Against this united front, many a well-placed and secure professional,
upon taking a rather obvious position against exploitation and abuse, or
upon simply describing what is in the pornography or in the research on
its effects, has been startled to be screamed at by formerly rational
colleagues, savaged by hostile mail (sometimes widely electronically
disseminated), defamed by attacks on professional competence, subjected
to false rumors, ostracized instead of respected, libeled in and out of
pornography, sued for speech by those who say they oppose suits for
speech, and investigated by journalists and committees---not to mention
blandishments of money from pornographers, eviction from homes, and
threats against families. Most fold. With intellectuals intimidated,
what chance do prostituted women and raped children have?]{.font4}

[In the defense of pornography against the ordinance---the first
effective threat to its existence---the outline of a distinctive power
bloc has become discernible in the shadows of American politics. Cutting
across left and right, uniting sectors of journalism, entertainment, and
publishing with organized crime, sprawling into parts of the academy and
the legal profession, this configuration has emerged to act as a
concerted political force. Driven by sex and money, its power is largely
hidden and institutionally without limits. Most of those who could
credibly criticize it either become part of it or collaborate through
silence. No political or legal organ is yet designed or equipped to
counter it. Existing structural restraints on excess power---such as the
government's checks and balances---are not designed to counter social
combinations like this one. In western democracies, only governmental
power is formally controlled, as  if the government is the only entity
that can cohere power of abuse it. Private in the sense of
nongovernmental in origin, this bloc uses government (such as First
Amendment adjudications) as just one tool, wielding less visibly against
dissenters a clout similar to the government's clout in the McCarthy
era.]{.font4}

[Politicians who live and die by spin and image grovel before this
machine. Law has been largely impotent in the face of it and lacks the
will and resources to resist it. Indeed, law has largely been created by
it, the reality perceptions entrenched through the machine's
distinctively deployed weapons of sex, money, and reputation being
largely indelible and impervious to contrary proof. Academic
institutions are often found cowering before it and have ceded to it
much of their role of credentialing the intelligentsia. Its concerted
power defines what is taken as reality and aims to destroy those who
challenge or deviate. Almost no one stands up to it. Those who testified
in these hearings did.]{.font4}

[One incident exposed the workings of this de facto machine
accidentally. In 1986, a leaked memo from the public relations firm of
Gray & Company proposed a press campaign for the Media Coalition, the
group of trade publishers and distributors, including some
pornographers, that is substantially funded by Penthouse^63^ and was
behind the litigation against the ordinance in Indianapolis and
Bellingham. Gray & Company proposed to "discredit the Commission on
Pornography" and stop "self-styled anti-pornography crusaders" from
creating "a climate of public hostility toward selected publications.
"^64^ They got the contract, which budgeted about a million dollars to
pursue their recommended lines of attack. As reflected in the press this
campaign produced, this planned onslaught focused on two items of
disinformation contained in the proposal. The first is that there is no
evidence that pornography does harm. In their euphemistic PR language,
"there is no factual or scientific basis for the exaggerated and
unfounded allegations that sexually-oriented content in contemporary
media is in any way a cause of violent or criminal behavior. "^65^ The
second is that the campaign to stop pornography "is being orchestrated
by a group of religious extremists. "^66^ The mainstream media slavishly
published as news the spewings of the groups fronting this strategy,
establishing both lies as conventional wisdom.]{.font4}

[The false statement that scientific evidence on the harmful effects of
exposure to pornography is mixed or inconclusive is now repeated like a
mantra, even in court. It has become the official story, the baseline,
the pre-established position against which others are evaluated, the
standard against which deviations must defend themselves, the common
sense view that needs no source and has none, the canard that
individuals widely believe as if they had done the research themselves.
Few read the scholarly literature or believe they need to. No amount of
evidence to the contrary---and evidence to the contrary is all there
is---is credible against the simple reassertion of what was believed,
without evidence, to begin with. Associating all work against
pornography with widely reviled extremists of the religious and
political right---without regard for the lack of factual basis for this
guilt by association---is similarly impervious to contrary proof and
produces a self-righteous witch-hunt mentality. Individuals
strategically singled out as threatening to the financial health of Gray
& Company's "selected publications" are also used in pornography, ^67^
this cabal's ultimate weapon. Such attack-pornography potently and
pervasively targets sexualized hostility at pornography's critics and
destroys their status as credible speakers who have anything of value to
say. The effect of lowering the human status of the critics can be
relied upon to be discounted as having occurred by the norms of public
discourse, which pervasively pretend that what is done in pornography
occurs off stage in some twilight zone---coming from nowhere, meaning
nothing, going no place.]{.font4}

[If this cabal acts in planned and organized ways at times, usually its
common misogyny and attachment to pornography are themselves the
conspiracy. The legitimate media act in their own perceived
self-interest when they defend pornography, making common cause with
mass sexual exploitation by calling pornography "speech. " They seem to
think that any restraint on pornography is a restraint on journalism.
Their mistaken view that mainstream media and pornography are
indistinguishable---the ordinance's definition of pornography
distinguishes them, as does every pornography outlet in the
world---pervasively distorts factual and legal reporting.^68^ The
resulting tilt is inescapable and uncorrectable; other than one's own
experience to the contrary, which this process makes marginal, readers
have no access to other information. That mainstream journalists tend to
see their own power at stake in the legal treatment of pornography is
particularly worth noting because they are not pornographers.]{.font4}

[Sometimes the ax being ground is close to home, such as for journalists
to whom Linda "Lovelace" was pimped when in captivity. ^69^ Those who
used her sexually have a specific stake in not believing that she was
coerced to perform for the pornography film Deep Throat. They remain at
large, mostly unidentified and writing. How often
pornographer-manipulated news stories are concretely bought and planted
can only be imagined, but how difficult can privileged access be for the
pornographers and their point of view, given that they are often dealing
with their own customers? Under these conditions, with access to
information owned and controlled for content, with sex and money as
potent motivators, the availability of unmediated original materials
such as these hearings---these documents against the deluge---is as
precious as it is rare.]{.font4}

[You hold in your hands the samizdat of a resistance to a sexual fascism
of everyday life---a regime so pervasive, so ordinary, so normalized, so
established, so condoned, that there is no underground from which to
fight it or in which to get away from it. The hearings are the only
source on the way pornography concretely works in everyday life that has
seen the public light of day. And they may be the last. Every day the
pornography industry gets bigger and penetrates more deeply and broadly
into social life, conditioning mass sexual responses to make fortunes
for men and to end lives and life chances for women and children.
Pornography's up-front surrogates swallow more public space daily,
shaping standards of literature and art. The age of first pornography
consumption is young, and the age of the average rapist is ever
younger.^70^ The acceptable level of sexual force climbs ever higher,
women's real status drops ever lower. No law is effective against the
industry, the materials, or the acts. Because the aggressors have won,
it is hard to believe that they are wrong. When women can assert human
rights against them, through a law they can use themselves, women will
have a right to a place in the world.^71^]{.font4}

[1. Everywoman published only the Minneapolis hearings, and those only
in Britain, in 1988. Pornography and Sexual Violence: Evidence of the
Links (Everywoman, 1988). Everywoman noted in its introduction,
"\[publication of this material\... is an historic event because
strenuous efforts have been made\... to persuade a publisher in the
United States to make them publicly available. It has proved impossible
to persuade any publisher, in the very country where pornography is
itself protected as 'freedom of speech, ' to risk any association with
evidence about its harmful effects on society---and especially on women
and children. This is one of many indications that in the United States,
freedom of speech is available only to the assailants and not to the
victims. The power and wealth of the pornography industry, and
interconnections with 'respectable' publishing, distribution, and sales
outlets, mean the power to censor those who do not participate, do not
agree with what is being said, and seek to expose the harm they are
doing" (p. 1).\

Possessing Women (G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1981).]{.font3 .sgc-9}

[3. The ordinance has been actively considered in many other
jurisdictions in the United States and was introduced before legislative
bodies in Germany, Sweden, and the Philippines. No Canadian legislature
or court has considered the civil rights ordinance. The Supreme Court of
Canada upheld Canada's pre-existing criminal obscenity law on the
constitutional ground that pornography harms women and equality. R. v.
Butler, \[1992\] 1 S. C. R. 452 (S. C. C. ). Widely circulated false
reports of the role of Butler in customs seizures of gay and lesbian
pornography in Canada, and an analysis of the contribution of the civil
rights approach to pornography to promoting gay liberation, are
discussed in Christopher N. Kendall, "Gay Male Pornography After Little

[22. American Booksellers v. Hudnut, 771 F. 2d 323, 328 (7th Cir. 1985).
"Therefore we accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of
subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status
of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and
injury at home, battery and rape on the streets. " See the Appendix on
pp. 465-482 for the full text of this opinion. Given that Judge
Easterbrook strongly concludes that pornography as defined does the
harms the ordinance makes actionable, some statements in its footnote 2
(see Appendix, p. 481) have generated confusion. Contrary to footnote 2,
the empirical studies on the effects of exposure to pornography do not
"conflict"; the older studies have merely been superseded, as often
happens when science progresses. The legislative record in turn did not
"conflict" either. The legislative record before the Seventh Circuit
contained only empirical studies and victims' testimony documenting
harm. There were no empirical studies that showed no harm. Legal briefs
before the Seventh Circuit by ordinance opponents did contain in their
arguments references to prior governmental bodies elsewhere that, based
on the superseded empirical studies and no testimony by victims, had
concluded that the empirical record on harm was divided. This, however,
presented no conflict in the legislative facts of record. Further
contrary to the suggestion implicit in footnote 2, no court is
constrained to conclude that a legislature's factual record adequately
supports its legislation if that record is not strong enough. That is,
there was no empirical conflict of legislative fact before the Seventh
Circuit on the question of harm, and the Seventh Circuit was not
compelled to find that Indianapolis was permitted to legislate on the
basis of the facts it had.]{.font3 .sgc-9}

[23. The hearings also show some differences among the ordinances in
specific localities, distinctions that have been previously obscured.
Unlike the Minneapolis ordinance, the Indianapolis ordinance requires
that violence be shown or done for the materials to be actionable (see
p. 444, defense to trafficking claim that materials are only subsection
(6) of definition). The Massachusetts ordinance effectively limits its
trafficking provision to visual materials (see p. 460). Both of these
features were thought by politicians to make the bills more acceptable
to the ordinance's opposition, but they made no difference at all. The
judge who invalidated the Indianapolis ordinance did not even notice
that it was limited to violence, and the Massachusetts ordinance was
just as politically untouchable as if it had also made words-only
materials actionable.]{.font3 .sgc-9}

[24. Notable examples can be found in accounts of the Indianapolis
hearings in Donald Alexander Downs, The New Politics of Pornography
(University of Chicago Press, 1989) ("Downs"), which was not based on a
transcript, but on a document footnoted by him as "Administration
Committee Notes. " Errors resulted. For example, Edward Donnerstein's
appearance before the Council was not, as Downs asserts, a "surprise
move" (Downs, p. 123). It had been clearly announced before by Deborah
Daniels. See Indianapolis Hearings, p. 283. Downs states further: "As at
Minneapolis, MacKinnon questioned Donnerstein, eliciting testimony on
his research to support her legal points" (Downs, p. 123). I was not
present when Donnerstein testified in Indianapolis. The ordinance's
proponents did not manipulate these events, as Downs implies. Downs did.
Presumably, the publication of these hearings makes distortions like
these less possible. It should be noted that the official videotape on
which the transcript of the Indianapolis hearings in this volume is
based was incomplete when received. Attempts to locate sources for the
hearings beyond the partial videotape proved fruitless. Asked for the
source documents he referenced, Downs said he no longer had them (Letter
of Donald A. Downs to author, July 19, 1996). John Wood and Sheila Seuss
Kennedy, asked for written copies of their testimony, said they could
not find them. The Records office at the City-County Council in
Indianapolis said they keep official documents for seven years only,
which is legally standard. Media sources who videotaped the hearings
independently said they did not keep the tapes.]{.font3 .sgc-9}

[25. Altering the record to weaken the case on causality is illustrated
by comparing two editions of the first national story The New York Times
ran covering the Minneapolis hearings. One included in its report of the
testimony of R. M. her direct how-to causal sentence: "When he convinced
me to be bound, when he finally convinced me to do it, he read in a
magazine how to tie the knots." "Minneapolis Rights Attack on
Pornography Weighed," The New York Times, Sunday, December 18, 1983, p.
22. A different edition of the same article, headlined "Minneapolis
Asked to Attack Pornography as Rights Issue," omitted only this
sentence, leaving the witness with only her testimony stating by simile
a weaker relation between using pornography and his actions: "My husband
would read the pornography like it was a textbook." Sunday, December 18,
1983, p. 44.]{.font3 .sgc-9}

[26    For example, Wendy McElroy, XXX: A Woman\'s Right to Pornography
(St. Martin's Press, 1995) states: "Dworkin and MacKinnon orchestrated
the public hearings at which the ordinance was aired. They called only
the witnesses they wished to hear from" (p. 92). In Minneapolis, Andrea
Dworkin and I were hired as expert consultants to present relevant
witnesses. As the transcript shows, we did not control who was called or
who was allowed to speak. Everywhere, the hearings were public. Notably,
Wendy McElroy was listed third of those who were to speak against the
ordinance at the Los Angeles hearing, but she did not present herself to
speak.]{.font3 .sgc-9}

the harm pornography does to those who are coerced to make it, forced to
consume it, defamed through involuntary appearances in it, assaulted
because of it, and targeted for abuse and exploitation through its eight
billion dollar a year traffic. When pornography's victims---mostly women
and children---are believed, its harm is amply documented. Unlike the
right wing's approaches, the civil rights approach to pornography was
created to permit the injured access to court to try to prove that
pornography *did* harm them in these ways. Inflicting such devastation
on human beings is no one's civil liberty. " This unanimity was
particularly remarkable in light of Kate Millett's signature on the FACT
brief, although many who signed the FACT brief seem not to have read

Minneapolis City Council President Alice W. Rainville "to express
dissent and dismay at Mayor Donald Fraser's veto of your ordinance to
define pornography as a violation of civil rights. . . While many hard
questions of conflicting rights will face any court that confronts
challenges to the ordinance, as drafted it rests on a rationale that
closely parallels many previously accepted exceptions to justly
stringent First Amendment guarantees. While remaining uncertain myself
as to the ultimate outcome of a judicial test, I urge you not to allow

visibility and credibility in a Time magazine cover story, he was
hounded, harassed, and probed by journalists and attacked in Playboy;
excoriated as a censor and subjected to an intense rumor campaign of
vilification on the Internet; likely deprived of a scholarship offer for
graduate school at MIT; canceled before a Congressional committee, where
he was to testify; and threatened with the loss of his degree by his

formal inquiry into bogus charges that went on for years, although he
was eventually cleared of all the serious charges. His initially sought

[\
]{.font5 .sgc-1}

[In these hearings---Minneapolis in 1983 to Massachusetts in 1992---
women testify about being hurt in and by pornography. This hurt includes
every kind of sexual exploitation and abuse. The hearings are road maps
of injury, made graphic through the speech of those who had their legs
spread, their hands tied, their mouths gagged. These hearings and the
political organizing that went into creating them pushed silence off the
women in these pages---they stood up and spoke. But while some
legislators listened---and while other hurt women, still silent,
hoped---society at large pretty much turned its back on the suffering
caused by pornography and refused to consider honorable and equitable
remedies. These hearings also contain all the familiar leftist arguments
for pornography: it is free speech or free sexuality in a free
marketplace of ideas. Only when women's bodies are being sold for profit
do leftists claim to cherish the free market. The protectors of
pornography have arguments and principles; the status quo supports the
validity and legitimacy of their world view. Their arguments and
principles help to continue pornography's current status as
constitutionally protected commerce in women and maintain the
colonialization of women's bodies for male pleasure.]{.font4}

[Listening to the arguments for pornography is like listening to the
refrain of a song one can sing in one's sleep. Listening to the victims,
on the other hand, requires patience and rigor; it requires the courage
to take in what they have to say---to feel even a tiny measure of what
they have endured. Many women try to distance themselves from the shame
and squalor of sexualized violation---and refuse to empathize with hurt
women. They especially do not want the hurt to be public; they reject
what they consider a politics of victimization. In reality, they are
rejecting the facts of women's lives, often including their own, and a
politics of resistance to male power over women.]{.font4}

[I come from a generation of women who did not have feminism. I was born
in 1946 and graduated from high school in 1964. Women were invisible in
history and culture, literature and politics, art and athletics. The
best way to see a woman protagonist would have been to go to a play by
Euripides. After the Greeks, it was all downhill. I found myself on the
political Left because of the issues I cared about as a child: prejudice
against blacks, including de jure segregation in the South and apartheid
in South Africa; abortion and contraception, both of which were then
criminal in the United States; anti-Semitism, from pogrom to Holocaust,
all of which my family, mostly dead, had experienced; the rights of the
working man, because my father, who was pro-union, worked in a post
office as well as being a teacher; literacy and access to books;
poverty; peace in the face of nuclear threat and the Cold War; and I
liked Lenny Bruce, Bessie Smith, and jazz. My concerns had to do with
human suffering---I was against it---and social fairness---I was for it.
This may sound simplistic, but concentrating on suffering and fairness
is an exacting and difficult discipline. For me, these were urgent and
troubling issues of conscience, not ideology. I never took a stand based
on what is now called theory, although I did read Marx and Engels,
Bakunin, Kropotkin, Prudhomme, Henry David Thoreau, and even Ernesto Che
Guevara's]{.font4} [Guerilla Warfare]{.font4}[, which, in high school,
along with]{.font4} [Catcher in the Rye,]{.font4} [I studied and adored.
There weren't any mountains where I lived in New Jersey, but I practiced
possible assault strategies on the first shopping mall built in the
United States, just blocks from my parents' home. My understanding of
politics has always been concrete: humans are being hurt; here are
actions that must be taken and institutions that must be changed. And I
read to learn: more about suffering, more about fairness. As with many
of my generation, maybe all, the Vietnam War was the defining event of
my young adult life. I was against it. I fought against it from 1965,
when I was arrested at a sit-in at the United States Mission to the
United Nations, until April 1975 when it ended.]{.font4}

[It has been a devastation to me to see the U. S. Left's disregard for
women and women's rights over the last twenty-five years: a nearly
absolute indifference to our suffering and an unapologetic disdain for
what is fair. In the 1960s many women my age lived as militant left-wing
radicals or flower children or both; but by 1970 some began to apply to
women the standards of justice applied to other disempowered groups. On
the ]{.font4}[Left women were used as menial labor, and our sexual
availability was taken for granted. Fighting for others, some of us
learned to fight for ourselves. Radical feminism emerged from the Left
and brought left-wing values of equality to women. The Left opposed
feminists every step of the way---and not just because the boys were
losing cheap labor and cheap lays. They were blind to injustice against
women: injustice that had their names on it. The Left especially opposed
emerging consciousness and activism regarding rape, wife-abuse, incest,
pornography, and prostitution. In the early 1970s, rape became a
cutting-edge issue. The organized Left opposed prosecuting rapists
without fear or favor because bogus charges of rape had been used to
persecute black men. Convicting white men who raped did not seem to the
men on the Left a fair move---one that would change everyone's
perception of rape and of black men. Redefining rape from the point of
view of the victims was taken to be vindictive and mean. Men of the Left
wanted female voices on rape silenced. In the mid-1970s, battery became
a cutting-edge issue. Left-wing lawyers conjured up the specter of the
"knock on the door, " police-state entry into the home that is, after
all, a man's castle. They wanted the voices of beaten women and feminist
advocates silenced. Rather than face the suffering of the victims, they
became militant on the due-process rights of the perpetrators. A few
years later, incest became a cutting-edge issue. The Left denied its
existence while protecting the sexualization of children under the
rubric of free sexuality for children. The Left simply denied the harm
done to children by pedophiles, rapists, sadists, and pornographers, any
of whom might be strangers or acquaintances or family. Efforts to
protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation were characterized
as a tyranny of the repressed. The Left wanted the voices of adult
survivors silenced and refused to listen to child victims without a
mountain of independent corroboration. In the late 1970s, pornography
became a cutting-edge issue. The Left took the position that pornography
was liberated sexuality and that those opposing it were right-wing
collaborators. A free-speech absolutism, which in earlier years the Left
abhorred with respect to racism, became the Left's uber-principle. When
prostitution and the trafficking in women globally became cutting-edge
issues in the mid-1980s, the Left suddenly honored money, contracts, and
exploited labor---as if it were the dream of all girls to suck cocks for
a few bucks.]{.sgc-3}

[This chronology of issues is only approximate, because victims,
survivors, and organizers worked on all these issues (always with
opposition from the Left) before the larger public became aware of them.
For instance, the first antipornography demonstration by feminists was
in 1970 in New York City: a sit-in to denounce both the low pay of women
workers at Grove Press and its publishing of pornography. Barney
Rossett, owner of Grove, condemned the sit-in as a CIA plot. The charge
of right-wing collaboration was born then. Earlier, in 1968 and 1969,
there had been protests against the Miss America Pageant: protests
against objectifying and dehumanizing women through sexual voyeurism. In
the public's perception, one issue followed on the heels of another,
often supplanting attention paid to the prior agitation; but for
feminists who worked against violence against women, the 1970s and 1980s
were two decades of constantly expanding knowledge, all related through
speak-outs, consciousness-raising, books, conferences, demonstrations,
marches, civil disobedience, lobbying, drafting legislation, and
building women's studies departments. It started with rape, what is now
called "stranger rape. " But once women began to understand rape, to
unravel the lies about it (legal and vulgar), each of the other issues
began to show through what had been a lead barrier of obfuscation,
denial, indifference, and outright cruelty. These issues were all
connected, intertwined; in any given woman's life, they intersected in
complex ways.]{.font4}

[The Left has pretty much failed in its efforts to block feminist work
against rape, wife-abuse, and incest, but it has been more successful in
protecting pornography and prostitution. Every conceivable effort has
been made to silence women who have been hurt in or by pornography: they
are slandered, stigmatized, stalked, and shunned. Similarly, survivors
of prostitution are expected to disappear into that thin gray line
between night and day, not living or dead: touched too much inside;
dirty vaginas, dirty mouths; not citizens, not like us, not of us;
nothing to say. The men who rape or batter or incestuously rape or
sexually abuse children or make pornography out of women and children or
use pornography made of women or children or use prostitutes or pimp
prostitutes always have something to say. On the Left, these men are
deemed to have ideas; their experience is respected---the more low-down,
dirty, or violent, the better; they are crowned as liberators,
rhetorically worshiped as freedom-fighters---each woman or girl used
(plugged or boned or whatever the current hostile slang is) representing
a triumph over repression or suppression or oppression; in fact, a
triumph of expression.]{.font4}

[In addition to romanticizing forced sex and celebrating sexual
exploitation, the Left has joined the Right in defending the culture of
dead white men: protecting it from criticism or change; keeping it
Inviolate, immune from contamination by creative persons not dead or
white or male. The culture of dead white men, built on the bodies of
silenced women and colonialized people of color, has become a weapon to
keep living women of all races silent. Like a private club that keeps
out all but an elite few, art and books especially are used to tell the
emerging women---emerging not only from silence but often enough from
hell--- that they are not good enough or important enough or worthy
enough to be listened to. The proof of their insignificance is in their
suffering: having been raped or beaten or prostituted. Was Aristotle?
Was Descartes? Why listen to women who are more pleasing laid out flat,
legs spread, than standing up, talking back, talking real? Why should
the men of liberation interrupt the liberatory act itself to listen to
the person whose hole he was sticking it in? And if I were to say that
hole is not empty space waiting to be filled by anyone or anything, what
would my authority be? How do I know? But he knows---every "he"
knows.]{.font4}

[The books I read growing up---the books of dead white men, or near
dead, the men living but remote by virtue of their own presumed
superiority to women---did not, could not, tell me about the suffering
of women or what it would take to make society fair for women. I read
the men of conscience---but Camus did not consider these questions, nor
did Sartre or Whitman or Shelley or Lord Byron. I read the men of
suffering---Dostoevsky, Proust, Rimbaud---but they were silent on the
suffering of women. The things I wanted in life were in the realm of
men, of culture: to write books, to be politically engaged; to
strategize against injustice, to expose it; to break down institutions
that supported suffering---laws, manners, habits, threat of force or
threat of the mob or threat of prison or threat of exile. I simply did
not understand that girls in my generation were excluded by definition
from doing virtually everything I wanted to do. The exclusion was
egregious; but so was the consequence of not identifying the excluded
group by name---women. I empathized with every group I knew to be
excluded and I knew them by name: blacks, the poor, exploited workers.
But men were the real people; women did not exist in consciousness. Men
were actors on the stage of history, doers in the culture of intellect
and creativity. Women were absent; and it is impossible to empathize
with a vacuum, a blank space, a nonentity. There was no injustice in
this invisibility; it was the nature of women to be absent from action.
There was no political conception that women were excluded, thus
disenfranchised, socially stigmatized, politically powerless---only that
women had a different, opposite function to men, a preordained,
predetermined purpose that precluded heroism and originality. History,
culture, justice were not our province; romance was, marriage was,
babies were. In truth, one's body got touched and pushed into and hit
and knocked around by men who had a birthright to invade using force,
which was taken to be a measure of desire: and one rooted for the
invader, the action hero, and disavowed her, the culpable victim.
Wanting to be the hero, a girl did not recognize rape as rape even when
it happened: she'd stumble around hurt and confused, trying to forget.
Wanting to be human, even when one was pushed down and pushed over and
drilled into, one did not recognize the generic nature of the event. Any
such recognition would strip one's life of dignity and individuality;
one would lose all credibility, even in one's own mind. Wanting to love,
even when treated with contempt wrapped in seduction and condescension,
one could not draw a line, even around one's own body, because he, not
she, was the significant person, the one who acted, the line drawer: the
real person. Girls wanted so much, not knowing they wanted the
impossible: to move in a real world of action and accomplishment; to be
someone individual and unique; to act on one's own feelings, not to have
to wait passively until a boy felt something so that one might
react---he turns on the switch and then the current flows; which switch
will he flick? One had appetites and ambitions, talents and desires,
capacities and potential, drive and vision, questions and curiosity.
Almost inevitably in my generation, girls were raped in response to
assertions of self: being in a proscribed place; being alone; being
outside; being inside; showing affection or interest or delight;
asserting ambition---intellectual, creative, athletic: every act was a
provocation, and eventually a man punished one for wanting either
something or anything.]{.font4}

[It was the biblical god of the Old Testament who said that knowledge
and sex were synonyms and made knowledge a male domain: he knew her. She
knew nothing and ate the apple from the Tree of Knowledge because she
was pliable and weak; she got expelled from the Garden, her home, and
got pregnant and multiplied, her labor painful and bloody to punish her
for daring to want to know, or for daring to act---to pick an apple.
There is no divinely inspired paradigm for a woman's wanting to know
without her also deserving and getting punishment: not, at least, in the
Judeo-Christian world. The punishment is against her body: taking it,
using it, entering it, causing her pain, her will irrelevant. The
punisher has power and gets pleasure, his recompense for being mortal.
The girl, erased and mute in the culture originating in that old book,
increasingly becomes invisible and silent to herself. The ambitions die.
The dreams die. The adventurei^1^, the explorer, the creator in her
dies. She becomes whatever her body means to men. Her mind is hurt by
rape and other physical assault to her body; it fades and shrinks and
seeks silence as refuge; it becomes the prison cell inside her. Rape and
physical assault damage the mind; and rape is concrete and consistent,
mandated by the man's ownership of the woman and by her separate
destiny, her bloody, painful destiny. Every invasion of the body is
marked in the brain: contusions, abrasions, cuts, swellings, bleeding,
mutilation, breaking, burning. Each capacity of the brain---memory,
imagination, intellect, creation, consciousness itself---is distressed
and deformed, distorted by the sexualized physical injuries that girls
and women sustain. No matter how much we are undressed, the shadow of
unexplained, undeserved pain covers us with shame and despair. All
around us there are other women, seemingly not hurt, making small talk,
acting normal, which means happy, not discontent, certainly not
devastated. Girls are still being socialized not to identify with---feel
empathy for---other females: she got hurt because she did x, y, z---I
didn't, so I didn't get hurt; she's at fault, I'm not; the punishment
fits her crime; blame her, exonerate him. This continuing, culturally
applauded socialization of women not to empathize with other women is a
malignant part of the culture of men, dead white ones or not. Women are
perceived to be appalling failures when we are sad. Women are pathetic
when we are angry. Women are ridiculous when we are militant. Women are
unpleasant when we are bitter, no matter what the cause. Women are
deranged when women want justice. Women are man-haters when women want
accountability and respect from men. Women are trash when women let men
do what men want. Women are shrews or puritans when we do not.]{.font4}

[We learn---still, now, despite the gains of feminism---not to call
attention to ourselves, only to the signets of our conformity: the
sexualized conventions of grooming. We cover over being the victims of
sexual abuse, because otherwise we are exposed in poses and positions
and with bruises that excite some men or many men or nearly all men or
the next man. Each abuser makes his cut, adds his mark, his smell, his
ejaculate, his contempt, his destruction, to the social identity of a
woman exposed. She is in the male mind---the minds of men---as the
spread-out thing, or the bruised and brazen thing, or the serially
fucked thing. She's rarely more than a picture in his mind anyway:
spread ejaculate on her and she's a dirtier picture.]{.font4}

[In 1972 I came back to the United States after five years in Amsterdam,
four of which I spent doing time as the battered wife of a tormenter, a
torturer even Amnesty International would hesitate to approach. In the
year before I came back---a year of being stalked, a year of running,
hiding, being homeless, having nothing---I began to ask questions about
women: why women were treated with contempt, violence; why no one cared
or intervened or helped even a little. When I was battered, virtually
every person whom I asked for help the many times I tried unsuccessfully
to run away told me I provoked the violence, that it was my fault, that
I liked it (even though I was running from it). My friends were all
leftists who cared about human rights---about suffering and fairness.
Only one was honest when I asked her why she wouldn't help me: I'm
afraid he'll hurt me, she said. Only feminists did not back off; only
feminists cared about how badly I had been hurt; only feminists did not
think that whatever he, the mad dog, did, I deserved or craved---or that
it was his right.]{.font4}

[Back in the United States in November 1972, I started working with
antiwar groups again. I found my former allies indifferent to violence
against women---and these were mostly pacifists. Organizationally, Left
groups embraced the idea of "strong chicks" (in the parlance of the
time) but repudiated a politics of anathematizing violence against
women. Feminists in the United States had been organizing speak-outs and
consciousness-raising groups since at least 1970; rape had emerged as a
political issue. The Left ignored, trivialized, and opposed the new
movement; and feminists did the work of creating a real political home
for women, a social place out in the open in which the suffering of
women counted and fairness toward women was a goal of social policy, not
just noblesse oblige on the part of individual men.]{.font4}

[The accomplishment of the women's movement in this regard was
staggering. Silence---a heavy tombstone over each woman's hurt body and
torn heart---was broken; one could hear the concrete crack, splintering,
breaking open, crevices becoming gorges. Women talked: this happened to
me. The stories were similar even as the women were different. The rapes
were similar even as the rapists were different. The devaluing through
insult and overbearing arrogance and vulgar assumptions of an innate
superiority was the same, no matter what the social or economic status
of the woman appeared to be. The rapists were men who crawled through
locked windows and skylights or emerged at night from dark bushes or
alleys; the rapists were teachers and neighbors and friends; the rapists
were daddy or daddy's best buddy or step-daddy or uncle or brother or
brother's best friend. Only the victims were able to-articulate the
elements of the. crime. Only the victims knew who the rapist was, what
he said, what he did, how he did it, and what it meant: what the act
expressed. (Rape is a very expressive act. ) U. S. laws on rape,
originating in English common law, made assumptions about women that
disguised and protected both rape and the rapist. Those laws assumed
that women would lie: accusations of rape were construed to be vengeful
lies by an angry slut or spurned lover. Rape itself was seen as a crime
against men if it was seen as a crime at all: a husband was injured in
his conjugal rights if his wife---loyal and not adulterous---was
violated; a father's rights over his unmarried virgin daughter became
worthless when she was ruined and despoiled. The crime was not against
the rape victim but against her male owner. If the male owner raped her,
it was not rape. Only when women said what happened to them when they
were forced was rape properly defined, understood, and
prosecuted.]{.font4}

[The Left and the Right have consistently had different positions on
rape; but neither has acknowledged rape from the point of view of the
women who experienced it. Both the Left and the Right denounced rape
with varying degrees of outrage, but the Left saw most rape as free sex
saturated with desire and the Right characterized rape as deviant and
rare. Rape in marriage was legal; this was not an issue for Left or
Right. The Left, which wanted to bring down power, hierarchies, and
despotism, did not have a problem with forced sex---with its
gender-based power, hierarchy, or despotism. I left the Left, although,
really, the Left left the Left by betraying women, who were suffering
and needed fairness in law, social policy, money, culture, speech,
media, politics, and governance. The Left moved rightward when it
abandoned women to rape, battery, incest, pornography, and prostitution.
As with many women, for me equality became the heart of a living
political quest to end the suffering caused by sexual abuse and
exploitation through finding fairness. In betraying women, the Left sold
itself out; and it is correct to say, I think, that the demands of
feminism have caused a political realignment in the United States in
which the recognized political continuum moves from Right to further
Right to armed and murderous Right. Far to the left, off the mainstream
continuum---at least as currently articulated in popular discourse---are
women whose politics are animated by a commitment to listening to those
who have been hurt and finding remedies that are fair.]{.font4}

[The fact is that the speech of the socially worthless, the sexually
stigmatized, is hard to hear even when the victims shout. Rapists and
pimps talk louder, their speech amplified by the money behind the words
they use. Rapists and pimps, representing the interests of normal men,
some of whom rape, some of whom buy, seem to have the law of gravity on
their side: they reify the status quo, which is what gives them
credibility, legitimacy, and authority. They sound coherent. No matter
what lie they tell, it passes for truth, because the hatred of women
underlying the lie is an accepted hatred, a shared and unchallenged set
of prejudiced assumptions. The woman who has been raped or pimped has to
convince a hearer to listen because she counts. But she does not count
unless she can make herself count, unless she can change the direction
of gravity---turn the status quo, even momentarily, not just upside down
but also inside out. She needs the women's movement; she needs courage;
she needs stubbornness; she needs to want justice. It is fine for her to
hate those who ripped into her if hate keeps her willing to talk,
unwilling to let silence bury her again. She must dare to remember what
she prefers to forget; and then she must stand fast on the sickening
memory, which tries to drown her. She must stand right there. Any healed
wound she must reopen, must tear away scar tissue and scabs to see
what's underneath: ripping off her own skin, she sees the color of her
own blood. She has to use her body to remember and he's on her and in
her again; and this she must endure in order to speak. She has to be
able to relive pain and humiliation: however shy, however modest,
however unhappy to do so, she has to articulate violation, communicate
dread, explicate sadism, remember the hate he had for her, which
motivated him, and not die from that hate or the memory of it. Then
he---rapist or pimp or buyer--- says something, anything, and she is
drowning again, back under, invisible, silent, worthless, except for
whatever he gets out of her---pleasure or power or money. He always has
a revered principle on which to hang his prick: free speech or free sex
in the free market.]{.font4}

[He has a constitutional right to express himself, and if his art
requires that she be the canvas, so what? If he's an engraver and her
skin is his surface, so what? If he wants to sculpt her to death or
twist her body until it breaks where he turns her, so what? He's a
citizen; she's a cunt. The Constitution protects him. All's right with
the world.]{.font4}

[Then there is the right to sex, which is implicitly his, since he gets
what he wants: law, justice, honor, and feminist agitation
notwithstanding. If it gives him sexual pleasure, getting in his way is
mean and petty. If it hurts her, so what? If it insults or dehumanizes
her, so what? If---in order for her to be available---she needs to be
fucked as a child, trained, seasoned, so what? And if she screams, and
he gets off on it, so what? If she tears---her rectum, her vagina, her
throat---and he likes it, so what? If she bleeds---well, bitches bleed;
so what?]{.font4}

[The free market is where she is bartered, bought, and sold. It is often
euphemistically called a marketplace of ideas, but only his ideas have
value, especially his ideas, put into practice, of how to sell her. She
is meat in his marketplace; he is the butcher who wields the knife to
get the right cut; and he communicates through the cutting, then the
display of the body parts. She is worth more in pieces than she ever was
whole. The pimps' motive is twofold: money and pleasure. The user does
what he wants, calls it what he likes. Everyone wants to be him---to be
the user, not the used. This is a political point: what once was the
Left wants to be the user, does not want to be anywhere but on top of
the used; and some so-called feminists want to be the user, not to be
under, not to be the condemned, the injured. Each time a victim is
looked at, a man gets hard; the brave "women-aren't-victims" girls want
to be allies of the users, not of the used. It was ignorance to
disassociate oneself from the raped before raped women articulated what
rape is and means; it is malice, cowardice, and venality to disassociate
oneself from the raped now---after the raped have made rape socially
real. The same is true for battery, incest, prostitution; the same for
pornography, made from the raw material of women's bodies, used against
women's bodies, the production and the use designed to control,
dehumanize, humiliate, injure, and subordinate: push down, push under,
make lower, make less, render inferior.]{.font4}

[I am asking you to listen in these hearings to those who have been
hurt---and to care. I have always thought that conscience meant bearing
witness to injustice and standing with the powerless. I still think
that. I have always thought that equality meant an antagonism to
exploiters. I still think that. I used to think that the Left was the
side that valued those dehumanized by hate. I don't think that
anymore---unless feminists fighting pornography and the global
trafficking in women are the remnant, the last living leftists: facing
the new millennium in opposition to the biggest trafficking in human
beings this planet has yet seen. All the power is on the other side: all
the money, media, current law, unexamined assumptions about speech, sex,
women; all the fetishized sex that depends on dominance and submission
as a dynamic and the objectification of women as a fundamental element
of pleasure. There is nothing wrong with selling objects, generally
speaking, provided the labor of human beings is not exploited to make
the desired profit; but it is always and without exception a vicious
practice to buy and sell human beings, which we are---which women
are---no matter how used or raped or prostituted or incested or beaten
we have been; no matter how shamed or humiliated by the overt sadism of
some and the brutal indifference of the rest. You need to listen. You
need to know. You need to care about the suffering pornography causes
and be willing to decide what is fair.]{.font4}

[GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS COMMITTEE\
SESSION I: MONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1983]{.font3 .sgc-1}[,]{.font13 .sgc-1}
[1: 30 P. M.]{.font3 .sgc-1}

[Government Operations Committee:]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN VAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Having a quorum, the Government
Operations Committee will come to order. One of the things that I would
like to ask is that when there is a person who is presenting whatever
they have of material in terms of verbalization, that there be no other
comments because we do have a court reporter here who is taking it and
when one or two or three people are talking, she can't get it down. So
do it one at a time and let there be no other comments. This is not a
debate, this is a public hearing. We are going to hear and receive the
comments both pro and con from the audience. The persons that are now
about to take over will make their presentations, they will make their
comments, their slide presentations, and after that we will go into
public comments. It is in three stages. Today we go at 1: 30 until 4: 00
o'clock and we will reconvene at 5: 00 o'clock and continue on, God
willing, it will be over by at least 7: 00 or 8: 00 o'clock. Tomorrow we
have a 5: 00 o'clock public hearing, the same continued public hearing.
I would ask that the persons who are going to make comments and make
presentations use the microphone at the very end of that table so that
the television cameras can zoom in on you and do their thing. Okay. Now,
starting out, those that wish to speak, the sign-up sheet is right at
that table]{.font4} [(indicating).]{.font4}

[Does anyone wish to sign up to speak? How many people in the audience
are going to speak? Okay, we will allow three to four minutes in your
speaking. We will try to hold it down because there are quite a few
people who are going to speak. Number one on the agenda is Dr Edward
Donnerstein.]{.font4}

[ALLEN HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me, may I speak before we get into
Professor Donnerstein?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Go ahead, City Attorney.]{.font4}

[HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Allen Hyatt, Assistant City Attorney for
Minneapolis and I am assigned to this committee. Prior to the starting
of testimony, we are going to hear from Professors Catharine MacKinnon,
I believe, and Andrea Dworkin, both who are under contract to the City
Council to develop an ordinance relating the violation of women's rights
in regard to pornography to civil rights. And they have been asked by
our City Council to develop that ordinance, they have done so, proposed
ordinances before this committee and we will now hear from Professor
MacKinnon. Before we do that I would like to give you background. She is
a Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota. She has, with Ms.
Dworkin, conducted a course this year on pornography, particularly its
effects on women, particularly the violent aspects of pornography. \[She
is\] eminently well qualified to speak on this topic and that is why we
have contracted with her to do so. Professor MacKinnon.]{.font4}

[CATHARINE MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [As the committee knows, Andrea
Dworkin and I are here today to discuss with you the proposed ordinance
which we have drafted together under contract with the City to define
pornography as what it is, that is to say, as a violation of the civil
rights of women. We are proposing for your consideration a statutory
scheme that will situate pornography as a central practice in the
inequality of the sexes, in specific, as a practice that is central to
the subordination of women.]{.font4}

[This statute's principle arises under the Fourteenth Amendment, which
guarantees equality and freedom from discrimination to all citizens,
including on the basis of sex. The concept of the systematic relegation
of a group of people to inferiority because of a condition of birth,
that that idea should be, that those practices should be, illegal---that
idea is not novel in the context of the Fourteenth Amendment.]{.font4}

[The understanding and the evidence which we will present to you today
to support defining pornography as a practice of discrimination on the
basis of sex]{.font4} [is]{.font4} [a new idea. I will be submitting to
you, as soon as I am finished with this statement, a copy of my book,
which is a book about sex discrimination which made the argument that
defined sexual harassment as a form of discrimination on the basis of
sex on the basis of a similar view, that is, the same view of sex
discrimination that underlies this ordinance.]{.font4}

[In this hearing we are going to show the harm of pornography to women:
what it takes to make it, particularly how it is used on people, from
the coercion into making it to the effects of men consuming it, which
they act out on women, to the trafficking that provides both the
motivation and the access, to the harm of forcing it on someone to
attempt to get them to perform sexual acts that they have no desire to
perform, to seasoning children and prostitutes and wives and girlfriends
so that they will be more compliant sexually, so that they will become
debased and lacking in self-respect and lacking in existence and ideas
of their own, to more direct assaults, stimulated, made desirable, and
made legitimate and made sexy by pornography.]{.font4}

[We plan to show why and how and in what sexual violence has become fun
arid sexy and entertaining and feminine and liberating and a definition
of love.]{.font4}

[In particular, we want to show how the concept of pornography
conditions and determines the way in which men actually treat women.
Also the way men actually treat men and children.]{.font4}

[We will show the ways that this abuse goes on in public as well as in
private environments, and we will show that this is central to the way
in which women remain second-class citizens in those environments,
despite all our efforts to change that status.]{.font4}

[We will document this on a national scale and in particular, replicate
and show how everything that can be shown on a national scale is
occurring new in the City of Minneapolis.]{.font4}

[We will then argue that pornography has everything to do with why
public policies against some of the deepest injuries and injustices
against women---that is to say sexual violence including rape, sexual
harassment, battery, and prostitution---systematically have consistently
failed women, and we will argue why it is this ordinance will protect
them.]{.font4}

[The purpose of this hearing is principally factual. We think that we
have found a large part of the way that women have been kept silent for
a very long time, and that is that pornography silences women. This
hearing, this opportunity for our speech, is precious and rare and
unprecedented. That we can speak to our real injuries in a public forum
is the kind of opportunity without which, before now, the guarantees of
the]{.font4}

[First Amendment have not been useful to us. And they have not worked
for us. What I am saying is, if pornography silences women, if it has
already accomplished that silence, the First Amendment which-prohibits,
the way that the state can silence people is not useful to us.]{.font4}

[When I say that the purpose of this hearing is factual, what I mean is
that we will provide a factual basis for a legally sufficient sex
discrimination statute, both in terms of the Fourteenth Amendment
requirements and also to survive defenses that might be raised against
it under the First Amendment. It is designed in both of those
ways.]{.font4}

[The primary purpose of the hearing, as I am understanding it now then,
is not to advance legal arguments about why the statute withstands
attack under the First Amendment, although we believe that it will, and
I will be happy to respond to any questions that you have about that.
But the primary purpose is to provide a factual basis so that it can
withstand the defenses that most probably will be raised by principally
the pornographers under the First Amendment.]{.font4}

[Now, if asked, I am happy to address all---]{.font4}

[COUNCILMEMBER WALTER DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, as one of
the five committee members here, I will tell you why I think we are
having a public hearing. That is to gather input from the public about
the issue so this committee could gather the input and we could go to
the Council with a rational and intelligent suggestion on the issue.
That is why we are having a public hearing.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Absolutely, that is exactly our purpose.
And that, in particular, I think it is crucial that the people who are
here to speak can be able to speak. I am not going to advance a lot of
legal arguments to the hearing. The purpose is factual and the people
should be able to speak.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is on the onset what I was
saying. We are here to receive and listen. If there is any written
documentation I would like that to be passed up to the committee clerk
so it goes into the record. I have some here too that I will give
you.]{.font4}

[But secondly, I would like to say I recognize the fact that there's
going to be consensus which will bring about applause. I would ask that
you would cease on that, because it will slow down the process. It takes
away from the presenters in terms of what they are trying to say, and it
prolongs the hearing. So I will ask you to please not applaud whether
you agree or disagree with a certain presenter.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will also submit to you a copy of my book
and my vita, in that I am here as an expert consultant. Andrea Dworkin
will make brief comments and then we will begin the testimony.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. What I am going to do is that you
will make your presentation and then what I would like, since I don't
have the knowledge of the three presenters that will be coming before
us, I would like you, Professor MacKinnon, to introduce them and then we
will continue.]{.font4}

[ANDREA DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would just like to situate the
amendment that we have drafted in the context of international law. And,
in particular, in the context of the United Nations Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, from which I
would like to now read briefly. Article 2 states, "States parties
condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue
by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating
discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake to embody the
principle of the equality of men and women in their national
constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated
therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the
practical realization of this principle. To adopt appropriate
legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate,
prohibiting all discrimination against women. And protect the legal
rights of women on an equal basis with men. " And it goes on in that
vein, which I think is clear.]{.font4}

[Article 6 specifically states, "States parties shall take all
appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of
traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. "]{.font4}

[Now, I want to make clear the dimensions of the problem that we are
talking about. Pornography is part of the traffic in women. In this
country it is a seven billion dollar industry that buys and sells
women's bodies. I am going to put into evidence two pieces of
literature. One is a magazine article from the magazine]{.font4}
[Aegis,]{.font4} [called "The Political Economy of Pornography, " that
describes the actual economic dimensions of the industry. And I quote
from the article, "If all of this material were produced by a single
corporation, 'Pornography, Incorporated' at seven billion dollars a year
would be the fortieth largest company on the Fortune 500, as large as
Xerox, RCA, or Bethlehem Steel." In addition, I would like to suggest
that pornography is an industry based entirely on the domination of
women by men and that this description of the material now available is
accurate from the same article, "At least 25 percent of all the
heterosexual material sold in Washington's 'adult' bookstores, for
example, depicts explicit violence against women---torture of all kinds,
whipping, beating, mutilation, rape, and murder. Not all the violence is
vicarious; the stores also stock everything from whips and chains to
twelve inch spiked plastic penises, so that the customers can
participate directly. The hard-core material has become increasingly
sadomasochistic during the past few years, but even the basic soft-core
presentation of unequal, one-sided nudity (vulnerable, exposed women
with fully clothed or unseen men) conveys a very clear message of male
sexual dominance. Such one-sided nudity is commonly used by men to
dominate and humiliate other males in prisons and military training, and
has the same psychological effect when applied overwhelmingly to women
in culturewide media like soft-core pornography. "]{.font4}

[In other words, we are dealing with an endemic and systematic dominance
of men over women. That is the subordination we are trying to
address.]{.font4}

[I would also like to submit into evidence a copy of my book, which is a
description of the actual content in the pornography that is being
produced at this time.]{.font4}

[I thank you very much for this time, and we will now advance with the
testimony.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to state with these
presentations, you have an hour each. I read that to mean that within
this time frame from 1: 30 to 4: 00 o'clock that this will be cut down.
You will not speak for one hour each.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No. The understanding is that that is the
amount of time given to each of those experts. They will speak in some
cases only for, say, 15 minutes, and then there will be questions from
the Council, in some cases questions to us in an attempt to clarify the
relation between their testimony and this ordinance.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman, just so there is no
misunderstanding, we have twelve.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is this evening.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We have ten other people that wish to
speak.]{.font4}

[COUNCILMEMBER CHARLEE HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is tonight.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Sorry, that is tonight.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Dr. Donnerstein, are you ready? Dr.
Donnerstein, if you could begin by identifying yourself and I will
submit your vita.]{.font4}

[EDWARD DONNERSTEIN: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [wonder, can]{.font4} [I]{.font7
.sgc-1} [be heard in the back of the room without a mike? Can you hear
me?]{.font4}

[My name is Ed Donnerstein, D-o-n-n-e-r-s-t-e-i-n. I am a psychologist
at the Center for Communication Research at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, 200 miles south and a bit warmer.]{.font4}

[What I want to present into evidence is an outline of some of the major
topics I wish to cover with some of the major references in scientific
literature \[Exh. 1\], also allowing some space for notes by the City
Council, and four major book chapters, discussing overviews of the major
research of the last ten years on the effects, particularly the effects
of sexual violence or aggressive pornography or pornography in general,
and the effects it has on attitudes towards women about rape and
aggressive behavior. There are essentially six topics, really five, I
would like to cover \[Exh. 2\] and it is going to be a little difficult,
I think, given the slide projector, but I will try and I hope the
gentlemen and the women on the City Council will see them. I apologize
to members of the audience who can't.]{.font4}

[The six topics are as follows, in terms of dealing with the
relationship with sexual violence in the mass media on attitudes on rape
and attitudes on aggression. Number one, what are the images and
secondly, is there an increase in the media. The answer is going to be a
definite yes, and I will give some brief descriptions very
shortly.]{.font4}

[Secondly, what are the effects of this type of material on a number of
things. One, what are the effects of sexual violent images or aggressive
pornography on sexual arousal in rapists, known criminal offenders, and,
more importantly, quote unquote normals. I will describe what I mean by
that shortly.]{.font4}

[Thirdly, what are the effects of this type of material on rape-related
attitudes---the attitudes meaning myths about rape stereotypes,
willingness for a person to say they would commit a rape and attitudes
in general about women.]{.font4}

[And \[fourth\], what are the effects of this type of material on
aggressive behavior, primarily aggressive behavior against women in a
laboratory type situation which is, of course, the only place one could
conduct such a research.]{.font4}

[\[Fifth\], what is the relative contribution of sexual and violent
contents of the material. I think what the research tends to indicate,
this is not an issue of quote unquote sexual explicitness or nudity. It
is a question of how women are portrayed, particularly women as victims
which we are really talking about.]{.font4}

[Finally, what are the effects of massive long-term exposure to this
type of material.]{.font4}

[Let me make a preface here. We are going to be talking about,
initially, short-term exposure in a research context. Short-term is five
or ten minutes of exposure, primarily to very normal types of male
subjects. I think you will see, even with that, some fairly dramatic
type of results.]{.font4}

[When we get to long-term exposure, I think you will see the effects are
even stronger, particularly with the types of material which have no
physical violent content, that is, the straight type of pornographic or
erotic material. So keep in mind a number of things. One, when I mention
in this research that there are no effects in the short term for
erotica, we are talking about material made by myself or other
colleagues, material which is sexually explicit and does not show power
orientation between males and females.]{.font4}

[When we talk about aggressive pornography, we are talking about
material in which women are abused physically and in which there are
acts of rape, mutilation, or other types of physical aggression. We will
talk about the long-term effects of this type of material.]{.font4}

[Number one, what are the images? Let me give you examples of what we
are talking about. We have what is classified as obviously nothing to do
with pornography at all, to the hard-core effects. We have three or four
images which will suffice.]{.font4}

[(Slide show being shown. )]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [This, I think, has nothing to do with
pornography, but I think the message is very clear. We find it as a
common scenario in most of the common material. This is a slide of a
woman who is tied up, bound, black and blue. It is nothing more than an
advertisement for a Rolling Stones album cover. I think it is
interesting, the woman is saying a scenario we find in a great deal of
pornography: "I am black and blue from the Rolling Stones and I love it.
" Violence is a sexual turn-on---that is the message which consistently
comes through in this type of material. And what we are going to say is
that, without question, that has very, very strong effects, particularly
on adolescent males and males who are beginning to form certain types of
stereotypes about human sexuality, about rape and violence.]{.font4}

[The next slide I call subtle. It might be my own desensitization. I
think it represents the over-the-counter magazine,]{.font4}
[Hustler]{.font4}[; which depicts violent types of images against women.
I think it deserves no other comment, but it is a subtle image compared
to the types of graphic violation we will get to very soon.]{.font4}

[This gets a little closer to the hard-core market. I should admit that
every one of these slides I have, you can find in almost every city. In
fact, the next slide you don't have to go to an adult bookstore to find.
I am not sure you have to find this in an adult bookstore either. I
think it gets a little more toward the violence.]{.font4}

[The next slide I have \[is\] a blank. I show it to only demonstrate the
excessive types of sex against women. Until we started on a recent
science foundation project, I found this is not excessive. I think a
number of people will find it a bit difficult to look at. I don't mean
it to offend anyone. I don't mean it to show anger to anybody. I think
you have to have some ideas about the type of material we are talking
about when we talk about aggressive pornography. This type of material
is readily available. I present it to show that the research will show
inclusively that many healthy males become sexually aroused to this type
of image.]{.font4}

[Now, the question is what are the effects of this type of material.
Like we just saw, the first question is, what are the effects on sexual
arousal and there are a number of reasons why I would like to discuss
that.]{.font4}

[I have a quote up there from Neil Malamuth who is at UCLA and basically
what he says, I can't read the quote, I am going to have to paraphrase
it. Basically what Malamuth says \[is\] that if individuals become
sexually aroused---which is a very positive state, we are not saying
there is anything wrong with sexual arousal---if they become aroused
from scenes of rape in the media, in pornography---that is, number one,
do they become sexually aroused? Would they go ahead and make the
attribution that if they engaged in such behavior it would be a sexually
arousing experience? Those are a number of conceptual leaps.]{.font4}

[First of all, you have to determine whether or not quote unquote normal
healthy males could conceivably become sexually aroused to brutality,
scenes of rape, scenes of mutilation.]{.font4}

[Secondly, even if they did, would they go ahead and make the
attribution that, number one, I would like to engage in such behavior
and secondly, if I so did, it would not only be sexually arousing for
the victim, which in fact it usually is shown that way, that it would
also be sexually arousing for myself.]{.font4}

[Let's ask the first question: is the material sexually arousing, and
who is it sexually arousing to? Most of the early research dealt with
the effects of this on a rapist. It was widely assumed that rapists
would be sexually aroused by images of rape in the media. If you look at
the graph up in the front, you see an example of a rapist and the
nonrapist population. Rapists were shown films which depicted rape or
films of mutually consenting intercourse. A group of nonrapists were
shown similar types of ]{.font4}[materials. When and what the
researchers did was look at sexual arousal, penile tumescence in males.
Basically what they found is that rapists do in fact become very
sexually aroused to violent images, images of women being aggressed
against in the sexual context. The assumption, however, was that normal
males, not convicted of a sexual crime, do not show the same type of
reactions. The assumption is that normals would not become sexually
aroused to this type of material.]{.sgc-4}

[A few years ago Neil Malamuth at UCLA conducted a large amount of
studies, by the way I am mentioning one percent of the research in this
area to get through it, but Malamuth found if you take normal males and
present them with a scene of rape from pornography, but you present them
with the common type of scenario which is a woman enjoying being raped,
when a woman is violated, aggressed against, she becomes sexually
aroused. What Malamuth found---one, normal, healthy males also became
sexually aroused when they viewed that type of image. If you present
them with a highly explicit erotic film, they become sexually aroused.
If you present them with a scene in which a woman is raped but doesn't
become sexually aroused, the majority of males would not become sexually
aroused. But most normal males, when you present them with a scene of
rape and the only differences between the scene on the left and the
other scene is right at the end of the rape, even though the violence is
the same, the victim shows sexual arousal---which, again, is a common
type of scenario one finds in the material---you find normal males
becoming sexually aroused to these type\[s\] of images.]{.font4}

[Let's go on for a second. Malamuth has found, as have we and other
researchers, that is, a scale called the Rape Myth Acceptance scale\...
touches many of the common types of myths which individuals hold about
rape: any woman who hitchhikes deserves to get raped, women
unconsciously set up situations which force rape on them, women enjoy
being raped, women who wear provocative clothing are putting themselves
in a place to get raped. These are common myths held by rapists. It is
held as an instrument to determine if treatment for a rapist was
satisfactory.]{.font4}

[What you find is that after only ten minutes of exposure to aggressive
pornography, particularly material in which women are shown being
aggressed against, you find male subjects are much more willing to
accept these particular types of myths. In fact, this particular slide
again shows a good example of that.]{.font4}

[Male subjects or female subjects were shown a sexually violent film in
which a woman is raped and gets turned on to the rape. After they had
seen this film a week later, they are more accepting of these types of
myths and more accepting on an Acceptance of Interpersonal Violence
scale. That scale has items \[such\] as: it is justified to hit your
wife or spouse, the only way to turn a woman on is through force, and
that women find aggressiveness a sexual turn-on. You find, after
exposure of this type of material, more acceptance of these types of
myths.]{.font4}

[Another interesting thing, if you look at Neil Malamuth's research, you
also find some other changes in attitude. This particular study showed
that if male subjects were presented with a rape depiction, that is
aggressive pornography, that is, if a woman shows a positive
reaction---I apologize for having to use that term, it is a term that is
used meaning that the victim in the scene becomes sexually aroused---you
find again that normal, healthy male subjects say the following. If
asked "What percentage of women do you know who enjoy being raped?
"---think about the question for a second, think about the context of
how this research is done---you find normal males, after five minutes of
exposure to pornography, say 25 percent of the women they know would
enjoy being raped.]{.font4}

[Secondly, what percentage of women do you know who enjoy being
aggressively forced into sexual intercourse? Again, we are not talking
about rapists, not talking about sexual deviants, \[we are\] talking
about normal, healthy male college students at Manitoba, UCLA,
Bloomington, and other places. \[They say\] 30 percent of the women they
know would enjoy being aggressively forced into sexual
intercourse.]{.font4}

[The most important question of all is questions that ask subjects,
after \[being\] exposed to this material: "what is the likelihood that
you would commit a rape if I guarantee that you won't be caught. " Think
about that for a second. You are asking a normal, healthy male, "would
you commit a rape after exposure to this type of material? " And on a
five point scale, you find that after exposure to sexually violent
images, particularly when those sexual violent images depict women
enjoying rape, up to 57 percent of those males indicate some likelihood
they would commit a rape if not caught.]{.font4}

[In fact, in the general population, as it turns out, anywhere between
25 and 30 percent of normal, healthy males indicate some willingness
they would commit a rape. And, in fact, if you look at those
individuals, and I think it is important to do so very quickly, you find
a number of interesting things about them. Again, this is the normal
distribution of at least male college students.]{.font4}

[One, they believe other men would rape if not caught. They identify
with the rapist, basically meaning, if you put them in a situation which
involves a rape, there is a good likelihood they would never convict the
rapist. They believe that, one, rape victims cause their own assaults,
two, derive pleasure from their assaults. It is associated with rape,
with aggression against women.]{.font4}

[More important than that, if you take the 25 or 30 percent, we are not
talking about a small minority, but a large percentage of people.
Particularly when you think about the amount of people that might see
any particular film, even if it is only one percent, we are talking
about an incredible amount of potential harm to women. Twenty-five to
thirty percent, if you take these individuals, and if you look at the
bottom graph that measures sexual arousal, the likelihood to rape
people, meaning those are males, that 25 percent indicate that they
would commit a rape. Basically you find those particular males, again
normal males in the population, not rapists convicted or sentenced in
any way, those particular males are sexually aroused to all types of
rape images. They are sexually aroused to rape images which give, the
images, that is, women enjoy\[ing\] being raped. More importantly, that
they are sexually aroused to the graphic forms of violence against
women. Even if it doesn't show these quote unquote positive
reactions.]{.font4}

[In fact, if you take a good close look at that bottom graph, you find
that those 25 to 30 percent of the male population are much more
sexually aroused to that scene of rape than they are to erotic types of
material. Furthermore, if you ask these males, would they find
committing a rape sexually arousing, the answer is yes.]{.font4}

[Now, what does this say about sexual arousal and attitudes? It says,
number one, there is a substantial amount of normal, healthy males who
can become sexually aroused to violent images, particularly in which the
woman is shown to experience pleasure---again, the common scenario. More
important than that, there was at least 25 percent of the male
population who would commit a rape if not caught. We are not saying they
would in fact commit a rape, except there is a high correlation between
items which I have just talked about and the use of actual physical
force admitted by these individuals. And in fact, if you use the same
scales on known offenders, you would find the same data.]{.font4}

[I am not going to make that leap that this would predict actual rape.
It predicts attitudes about rapes by offenders, that 25-30 percent are
aroused to all forms of sexual violence against women, not only finding
it arousing, but are willing to admit they will commit that type of act
because it would be arousing for them.]{.font4}

[Secondly, what type of an effect does this type of material have on
aggressive behavior against women? There is a lot of research that shows
if you expose male subjects to specifically violent erotica, you find
increases in violent behavior. Let me give a quick example. This is a
study in which male subjects saw \[a\] neutral type of films, erotic
films that we constructed, or a standard type of aggressive film in
which a woman is raped. In one condition, she shows a great deal of
pleasure from getting raped. In another we had to construct ourselves,
there was a negative ending. The interesting thing is, the scene was
identical. You are showing normal males a violent type of scene. And if
you look at the bottom data, how many women did suffer when male
subjects saw the women enjoying the rape? She enjoyed it less. She
enjoyed it more when there was more done. If the woman was raped but
there was a positive reaction at the end, she is seen as being more
responsible for what happened. There is no difference between the
positive and the negative ending of those films. The violence against
the woman, the pain and suffering, the brutality is identical. The only
thing is, one takes on the common pornographic scenario that violence is
a turn-on to the victim. What do males do, normal males? They see less
violence. In fact, after exposure to that type of material---by the way
if you take the same males, sit them in a room an hour later and ask
them to think of something sexually arousing and write it down as soon
as they become sexually aroused and write down what they are thinking
about, what do you think their passages are? They are scenes of rape.
That is what is becoming sexually arousing for them: violence. There is
nothing wrong with sexual arousal. The problem is its juxtaposition with
violence.]{.font4}

[What happens after a few conditioning trials is, as soon as you begin
to remove the sexual content and leave the brutality and the violence,
what do you find? Sexual arousal. In fact, in Abel's research at New
York University, you can predict how violent a rapist is in terms of,
did they in fact mutilate and murder the victim, in terms of how
sexually aroused they are, not to scenes of sex but to scenes of simply
violence against women.]{.font4}

[In our research, we are not talking about rapists. We are talking about
normal, healthy, young males. What happens in terms of aggressive
behavior? You find, for instance, that the erotic films have no effect.
Again, when I talk about erotica, I am talking about films we put
together ourselves. They show sexual explicitness, no power, anything of
that nature. When male subjects are angered and exposed to a scene of
rape, whether it has a positive or negative ending, as you can see from
the dotted line on the top, they are aggressive against the female. If
you show them a violent scene in which there is a positive ending, in
which they have not been angered, they are less aggressive against
females.]{.font4}

[Let me point out, I have been in the area of aggression for years.
Those of us who have worked in media violence or television will say one
thing: it is almost impossible to find individuals becoming aggressive
when they see violent films unless they have been angered or
predisposed. Here we have a group of subjects who are not angered or
predisposed. Yet after seeing several types of sexually violent
material, particularly the common scenario in which women enjoyed being
brutalized, enjoyed being raped, you get increases in aggressive
behavior. Keep in mind throughout all of this---I think it will be more
clear shortly---we are not dealing with hostile people. We are not
dealing with a prison population of sex offenders. We are dealing with
normal, healthy males.]{.font4}

[By the way, I don't mean to complicate things, my professional remarks
always come out in some of this. That is a little more complicated graph
than it should be, but I present it mainly because of a number of
things. Somebody asked me, I think in a news conference, about
objectivity. The best way to show objectivity is by replication of other
people. A lot of the research I have been talking about has been done by
mainly other people. I will talk about mv research shortly.]{.font4}

[This shows, if you can measure sexual arousal to sexual images and
measure people's attitudes about rape you can predict aggressive
behavior with women, weeks and even months later. That is what it shows.
And what we know is that this type of material does lead to sexual
arousal, and it does lead to changes in attitudes. Once you have found
those, you can predict aggressive behavior.]{.font4}

[We are not talking about correlations where we get into chicken/egg
problems of which came first. We are talking about causality. The
ability, at least \[in\] this research, to take certain types of images,
expose people to those images and make a prediction independent of their
background, independent of their past viewing habits, independent of
their initial hostility and make quite accurate predictions of potential
aggressive behavior. We have obviously come a long way, at least as
researchers. I think it suggests quite strongly there are strong
relationships between the material and subsequent aggression.]{.font4}

[In fact, good colleagues of mine would argue that the relationship
between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent
aggression and changes in or toward callous attitudes toward women is
much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and
cancer, mainly because most of that research is correlational. This is
not.]{.font4}

[Another question: what are we really talking about? Are we talking
about the effects of sexual explicitness or the effects of violence
against women? We are talking about the effects of violence against
women, at least in the research we have been doing. Let me briefly
mention one study in which we went ahead and took normal males. They saw
a sexually explicit film, a film which depicted violence against women
or a film which only presented violence against women. Besides looking
at aggressive behavior, we asked the subjects' feelings about rape and
if they would have used force to have sexual acts against women or if
they would have raped a woman if not caught. At the bottom, there is
erotic material. You find that both the aggressive erotic and aggressive
films increased attitudes about rape in a negative direction. And, in
fact, 50 percent of our subjects said they would not commit a rape if
not caught, if they saw just the aggressive film. It is not so much the
sexual content, it is however the role of the women in the film.
However, many subjects, when they see a woman aggressed against, will
see sexual content.]{.font4}

[If you look at the aggressive behavior, you find the same thing. The
erotic film in and of itself---that is a film that ends with intercourse
between sexually consenting adults---it does not lead to violence. The
aggressive film does, whether or not the people are angered or not
angered, and so does the aggressive erotic film.]{.font4}

[Let me end up talking, in the last couple of minutes, about the
longterm research. Researchers like myself and Neil Malamuth at UCLA are
looking at massive long-term exposure to this material. Some interesting
things occur. If you expose male subjects to six weeks' worth of
standard hard-core pornography which does not contain overtly physical
violence in it, you find changes in attitudes towards women. They become
more calloused towards women. You find a trivialization towards rape,
which means after six weeks of exposure, male subjects are less likely
to convict for a rape, less likely to give a harsh sentence to a rapist
if in fact convicted.]{.font4}

[In our own research we are looking at the same thing. Let me point out
one thing. We use in our research very normal people. I keep stressing
that because it is very, very important. What we are doing is exposing
hundreds and hundreds of males and now females to a six-week diet of
sexually violent films, R-rated or X-rated or explicit X-rated films. We
preselect these people on a number of tests to make sure they are not
hostile, anxious or psychotic.]{.font4}

[Let me point out, the National Institute of Mental Health and the
National Science Foundation and our own subjects committee will
not ]{.font4}[allow us to take hostile males and expose them to this
type of material because of the risk to the community. They obviously
know something some of us do not.]{.sgc-4}

[What we do is take these males and we prescreen them. That
represents---and I again apologize \[for\] getting so technical. I want
to point out how normal those males are. That is a straight line on top
which represents our population. The line underneath represents the
males we chose. As you see, they are below the mean. More than that,
this is a scale that runs from one to four. A score of one means you
possess some of these traits. As you can see, our chosen people possess
none of the traits. They are so normal, incredibly normal, that there is
no risk. This works against us in what we are doing.]{.font4}

[These males are then shown a number of films. Let me give you the
names, okay? They are porn, they see R-rated films:]{.font4} [I Spit On
Your Grave, Maniac, Toolbox Murders, Vice Squad, Texas Chainsaw
Massacre,]{.font4} [and others.]{.font4}

[The X-violent are commercially released films. They have scenes of
overtly physical violence. They are:]{.font4} [Captain Lust, Defiance of
Good, Sex Wish, Easy, Dirty Western]{.font4}[.]{.font4}

[The X-rated films, the violence in them, if there is, is not seen by
the subjects. Such films are:]{.font4} [Health Spa, Debbie Does Dallas,
Other Side of Julie.]{.font4} [They see them over a two-week
period.]{.font4}

[Let me, by the way, if I can, read the one quote. I think it is
important. This comes from a video cassette. Here is the advertisement
for one of our R-rated films. "See blood thirsty butchers, killer
thrillers, crazed cannibals, zonked zombies, mutilating maniacs,
hemoglobin horrors, plasmatic perverts, and sadistic slayers slash,
strangle, mangle, and mutilate bare-breasted beauties in bondage! "
Unfortunately, there is truth in advertising. That is what you get. I
think one should keep in mind, this material is for a young audience.
This is for fifteen, sixteen-year-olds rather than those that are
eighteen. We study eighteen-year-olds.]{.font4}

[Some examples. This material is classic. Women are killed in sexual
ways, in the bathtub or shower, as in Psycho-gone-astray films. Things
have gotten explicit. Every time a woman is killed, it has a sexual
overtone---it is to get the audience sexually aroused---and
juxtaposition with sexual forms of violence. Of course, the
classic,]{.font4} [Texas Chainsaw]{.font4}[---let me give you an example
from one of these. This comes from]{.font4} [Tool Box Murders.]{.font4}
[Basically, in this scene we have an erotic bathtub scene. A woman in
the bathtub massaging herself. There is a beautiful song,]{.font4}
[Pretty Lady.]{.font4} [It is a nice country western song that comes on.
In two min]{.font4}[utes the psychotic killer comes in. The woman
notices him. He is carrying a long, what is called a nail gun, it drives
nails through walls, a power nail gun. The music stops. He chases her
around the room and, in fact, again, it exemplifies the typical type of
scenario. When men are killed they are killed swiftly, no sexual
overtones. When women are killed, it is dragged out indefinitely. He
shoots her through the stomach with the nail gun. She falls across a
chair. He then comes up to her and the song]{.font4} [Pretty
Lady]{.font4} [comes back on as it did when she was taking the shower,
or excuse me, in the bathtub. He puts the nail gun to her forehead and
blows her brains out.]{.font4}

[Again, I think we have got to think about the audience watching this
film. It is a young audience. There is nothing wrong with the bathtub
scene, there is nothing wrong with sexual explicitness. What is wrong
is, it's incredible, it is in juxtaposition with some of the \[most\]
graphic violence available. And yes, young males will become sexually
aroused with the images. If you remove the sexual context, unfortunately
they will become aroused to the violence.]{.font4}

[After subjects and since---by the way, I have colleagues here who are
lawyers. After they had watched two weeks of the films, they are brought
to our law school and they see a documentary of rape, State of Wisconsin
versus David Tyler. It is a reenactment of a real rape trial. They sit
in the trial as jurors. We were not interested in the rape behavior, we
were interested in the men's thoughts on violence with women and how
they view women. I think what you will see is desensitization. This is
our victim. During the testimony, into the trial, a physician who
attended to the victim presents into evidence a picture of the victim
after she was raped and this is passed out, by the way, to these male
jurors. Again, two weeks after exposure to this type of material, what
do we find?]{.font4}

[Basically, what they show is the same thing. Let me go through quickly.
Here are the subjects' moods on a daily basis. You see over a time less
depressed, less annoyed or bothered by forms of graphic violence. If you
ask them about particular perceptions of violence, if you look at the
same films from day one to day five, if it is one week or two weeks,
they see less blood and gore, and less violent scenes. Over time they
find the material more humorous, they are less depressed, they enjoy the
material more and are less upset. You also find the same things for the
X-violent films--- those are X-rated in which the main scene is women
being raped, women being bound, hung, aggressed against in general. You
find that subjects find less violence, as time goes on, against women in
these films over repeated exposure. They are just as sexually aroused
over this, however, \[as\] to the material. Sexual arousal does not
decrease. They feel much less likely to censor the material, they are
less offended by the material, they see this \[as\] less graphic and
less gory, they look away less. What that means on the first day when
they see women being raped and aggressed against, it bothers them. By
day five, it does not bother them at all. In fact, they enjoy
it.]{.font4}

[If we look again, how upset? They were less upset and less
\[depressed\], and they found the material makes a great deal of sense
and was more meaningful by the end of the week. I am not sure what is
exactly meaningful. If we look at how offensive the material is, it is
much more offensive on day one than day five. The violent material was
very degrading on day one, much less degrading on day five. If we look
as time went on, they found it less and less degrading, until the fifth
day. There is a reason for that. We happen to tell them we will show
them a double feature and we don't do that. They find the material less
degrading with time.]{.font4}

[We have a film called]{.font4} [Vice Squad.]{.font4} [If subjects saw
that film on day one, on day one they see a lot of scenes of rape. On
day four, nothing has changed in the film, they see half the amount of
rape, they become desensitized to what rape and violence is. This
represents their recollections to the one and a half hour rape trial. We
are a long way from completely analyzing this data.]{.font4}

[On the last day we bring in a control group of subjects who have never
seen the films. We ask how injured the woman was. Subjects who have seen
violent material or X-rated material see less injury to a rape victim
than people who haven't seen these films. Furthermore, they consider the
woman to be more worthless than any of them who have not seen this
material. There are a number of other correlations which I am going to
summarize because of time.]{.font4}

[Basically what happens is, the less violence the subjects see, the less
sexually aroused they are and less bothered by the material after one or
two weeks of exposure, the more they say the woman is responsible for
her rape, the less likely to convict the rapist. The less injury they
see on the part of the victim, the more worthless they see the
individual.]{.font4}

[Let me make a 30-second closing statement. What does all the research
say? Well, compared I think to 1968, when we had the Pornography
Commission,
[]{#minneapolis1.xhtml#footnote1}^[1](../Text/minnNotes.xhtml#bookmark1)^ I
think it says many different things.]{.font4}

[One, the material has changed quite drastically. Secondly, the research
techniques we have as researchers have also changed. I think we are
asking many different questions today than years ago. Unfortunately, I
think it shows that short-term exposure to very normal, sociable,
intellectual young males is going to have an effect. It is either going
to reinforce already existing predispositions about rape in women and
maintain these callous types of attitudes or, worse than that, in fact,
change them in a very negative direction. And that is the majority of
the subjects. Unfortunately, there is out there a small percentage---and
I hate to use the word small, about 30 percent is obviously not a
majority, but I think it represents an incredible minority---who are so
influenced by this material that it becomes the ultimate sexual turn-on.
Individuals are becoming sexually aroused to the trivialization, the
degradation, and the use of women.]{.font4}

[The data---I think it speaks for itself. I am not a lawyer. I am not an
advocate. I am unfortunately an ivory tower professor that does his
research. I think the data is a little too clear, not only from myself
but dozens of professors across the country. I doubt that anybody
disputes the data. There are effects. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I feel that I would like to ask you a
question. In terms of your research, \[are\] the typicals of your
research beginning to reach out not only to women showing this love
affair with violence, is it not pointing also to men and children? I
just ask you that question. In other words, is it affecting
men?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In fact, our research \[looks\] only at
the effects it has on \[men. \] A number of my graduate students who are
women are now conducting research, independent of myself, on the effects
which this material has on women and the effects are more dramatic. Our
issue is how it affects men, not only in terms of how it affects their
aggressive behavior. We can't expose the material to them and see if
they go out and commit a rape. We are much more interested in effect:
how it affects our attitudes, attitudes about women, attitudes with
human sexuality, our attitudes about violence in general. And the issue
of desensitization \[to\] violence is not new. There are thousands and
thousands of studies. We can't show them violence. It \[wouldn't\] purge
all this aggressive energy. There is no research in the academic
community which supports that. There never has been and there never will
be. It is a theoretical issue. I am not just talking about my research,
by the way, we are talking about thousands upon thousands of studies.
Theoretically, if it is men leading ]{.font4}[to desensitization against
men, or violence against children, or violence against women, the same
thing is going to occur.]{.sgc-4}

[More important than that, I think, we have got to realize it, if you
assume that your child can learn from Sesame Street how to count one,
two, three, four, five, believe me, they can learn how to pick up a gun
and also learn attitudes. I think the concern should be what attitudes
are they learning about male/female relations. Unfortunately, their
attitudes are influenced with too much degradation and
violence.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have a couple of questions. Dr.
Donnerstein, could you explain why it is that your research comes to
conclusions that are so different than the conclusions of the Commission
on Obscenity and Pornography in 1970?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Ms. MacKinnon, it is not my research, it
is everybody's. But the material has changed. The Pornography Commission
made a concerted effort not to deal with violence images. In fact, there
were a couple of studies that eroticism leads to aggression. That
doesn't come through in a final report. You have to read the technical
reports to get that. They made a concerted effort to get away from
violence. They are asking questions we don't ask today. They were
looking at short-term effects. You are not going to find people's
attitudes changing over night. It is going to take a long time.]{.font4}

[What the research is doing today, thanks to the national support from
Mental Health and the \[National\] Science Foundation, is to allow
researchers to look at pornography which is drastically different, and
allow us to look at it with long-term type of exposure. I think, for the
most part, that is why the results are different.]{.font4}

[Let me comment, Professor MacKinnon. Many of the people who were on the
Commission that did the research, they have also changed their
mind.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you also describe just very briefly
what you are seeing, how do you characterize the long term effects of
the X-only?]{.font4} [DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [One of the problems,
I think, in our own naivete is, we thought nonviolent X-rated material
would lead to aggression with five minutes of exposure. The material
presents more subtler types of images which are going to work at
stereotypes and certain myths about women. What we find as soon as you
get into long-term exposure to this material, you begin to get these
types of changes. You may not necessarily get definite relations to
aggressive behavior, because that is going to be a little longer to do.
I think eventually we are going to get there.]{.font4}

[You get increases in sexual stereotypes and pretty much exactly the
same things in terms of the attitudes that you get with the violent
material. The only difference is the immediate increase in aggression.
That is really where the differences occur.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And is your research the first research to
complete this study of long-term effects of this kind of
material?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, I think both ours---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Particularly X?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Zillmann has, but that was reported a few
years ago. Basically the research by Zillmann stated that exposure did
produce arousal. Unfortunately, when you show them a scene of rape, they
became sexually aroused. There was some selective exposure.]{.font4}

[Basically, when they looked at attitudes, it was the attitudes that
were changing over the long run in a very subtle way. We can't expect,
as we did with the violent material which is so graphic, to get an
immediate effect. What we are finding is, the longer exposure, you begin
to get subtle changes in attitudes toward women.]{.font4}

[Let me bring this up. Zillmann happens to use the Sex Callousness
scale. The Commission found with one hour of exposure, there were no
changes in sexually-calloused attitudes, the same as violence. Those
sexu-ally-calloused attitudes are correlated with violence, if you read
the scale. With six weeks of exposure, when you have the funds to do the
research, you in fact find an increase on the part of males of
sexually-calloused type of attitudes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I want to thank you for your
presentation. You articulated it well. You have a vast reservoir of
research to share with this Committee and with the audience.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Andrea Dworkin has one question.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like Dr. Donnerstein to address the
fact that there have been a lot of general studies of violence in the
media and I would like to know if it is proper to say, from what you
have told us here, that the study of the impact of pornography is very
specific and concrete in ways that are distinguishable from the general
environment?]{.font4} [DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In fact, the
effects are much stronger and occur much more rapidly. I think the
interesting thing is, if you take a look at the research and really talk
about hundreds and hundreds of studies---I presented\] them into
evidence, a number of chapters which have all these
bibliographies---there is an incredible amount of consensus across
populations and measures and studies. That I think is interesting
because in ]{.font4}[the media violence area we have some ambiguity and
the relationships are statistically not as strong as they are here. So
yes, I agree with you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Dr. Donnerstein.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much. I hope you can
stick around and listen to others.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Next is Linda Marchiano.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right. Now prior to Ms.
Marchiano's speaking, I would ask there be no discussions during this,
because once again to reiterate, the stenographer is taking down
testimony. You now have the floor, if you wish to begin.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are trying to arrange so that you can
see the witness. Go ahead.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Give your name and spelling for the
stenographer.]{.font4} 

[LINDA MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I feel I should introduce myself and
tell you why I feel I am qualified to speak out against pornography. My
name today is Linda Marchiano. Linda Lovelace was the name I bore during
a two and a half year period of imprisonment. For those of you who don't
know the name, Linda Lovelace was the victim of this so-called
victimless crime.]{.font4}

[Used and abused by Mr. Traynor, her captor, she was forced through
physical, mental, and sexual abuse and often at gunpoint and threats of
her life to be involved in pornography. Linda Lovelace was not a willing
participant but became the sex freak of the '70s.]{.font4}

[It all began in 1971. I was recuperating from a near-fatal car accident
at my parents' home in Florida. A girlfriend of mine came to visit me
with a person by the name of Mr. Charles Traynor. He came off as a
considerate gentleman, asking us what we would like to do and how we
would like to spend the afternoon and opening doors and lighting
cigarettes and all so-called manners of society.]{.font4}

[Needless to say, I was impressed and started to date him. I was not
getting along with my own parents. I was twenty-one and resented being
told to be home at 11: 00 o'clock and to call and say where I was and to
call and give the phone number and address where I would be.]{.font4}

[Here comes the biggest mistake of my life. Seeing how upset I was with
my home life, Mr. Traynor offered me his assistance. He said I could
come and live at his home in Miami. The relationship was platonic, which
was fine with me. My plan was to recuperate and then go Back to New York
and live. I thought then he was being kind and a nice friend. Today I
know why the relationship was platonic. He was incapable of a sexual act
without inflicting some type of pain or degradation upon a human
being.]{.font4}

[When I decided to head back north and informed Mr. Traynor of my
intention, that was when I met the real Mr. Traynor, and my two and a
half years of imprisonment began. He began a complete turnaround and
beat me up physically and began the mental abuse. From that day forward,
my hell began.]{.font4}

[I literally became a prisoner. I was not allowed out of his sight, not
even to use the bathroom. Why, you may ask? Because there was a window
in the bathroom. When speaking to either of my friends or parents, he
was on the extension with a. 45 automatic 8 shot pointed at me. I was
beaten physically and suffered mental abuse each and every day
thereafter.]{.font4}

[In my book]{.font4} [Ordeal,^2^]{.font4} [an autobiography, I go into
greater detail of the monstrosity I was put through, from prostitution
to porno films to celebrity satisfier. The things that he used to get me
involved in pornography went from a. 45 automatic 8 shot and M-16
semi-automatic machine gun to threats on the lives of my family. I have
seen the kind of people involved in pornography and how they will use
anyone to get what they want.]{.font4}

[So many people ask me, why didn't you escape? Well, I did. I'm here
today. I did try during the two and a half years to escape on three
separate occasions. The first and second time I was caught and suffered
a brutal beating and an awful sexual abuse as punishment. The third time
I was at my parents' home and Mr. Traynor threatened to kill my parents.
I said, "No, you won't. My father is here in the other room. " And he
said, "I will kill him and each and every member of your family. " Just
then my nephew came in through the kitchen door to the living room. He
pulled out the. 45 and said he would shoot him if I didn't leave
immediately. I did.]{.font4}

[Some of you might say I was foolish. But I'm not the kind of person who
could live the rest of my life knowing that another human being had died
because of me.]{.font4}

[The name, Linda Lovelace, gave me a great deal of courage and
notoriety. Had Linda Boreman^3^ been shot dead in a hotel room, no
questions asked. If Linda Lovelace was shot dead in Los Angeles,
questions would have been asked. After three unsuccessful attempts at
escaping, I realized ]{.font4}[I had to take my time and plan it well.
It took six months of preparation to convince Mr. Traynor to allow me
out of his sight for 15 minutes. I had to tell him he was right, a
woman's body was to be used to make money, that porno was great, that
beating people was the right thing to do. Fortunately for me, after I
acquired my 15 minutes out of his presence, I also had someone that
wanted to help me.]{.sgc-4}

[I tried to tell my story several times. Once to a reporter, Vernon
Scott, who works for the UPI. He said he couldn't print it. Again on the
Regis Philbin Show, and when I started to explain what happened to me,
that I was beaten and forced into it, he laughed. Also at a grand jury
hearing in California after they had watched a porno film, they asked me
why I did it. I said, "Because a gun was being pointed at me, " and they
just said "Oh. " But no charges were ever filed.]{.font4}

[I also called the Beverly Hills Police Department on my final escape,
and I told them that Mr. Traynor was walking around looking for me with
an M-16. When they first told me that they couldn't become involved in
domestic affairs, I accepted that, and asked them and told them that he
was illegally possessing these weapons, and they simply told me to call
back when he was in the room.]{.font4}

[During the filming of]{.font4} [Deep Throat,]{.font4} [actually after
the first day, I suffered a brutal beating in my room for smiling on the
set. It was a hotel room and the whole crew was in one room. There was
at least 20 people partying, music going, laughing, and having a good
time. Mr. Traynor started to bounce me off the walls. I figured out of
20 people, there might be one human being that would do something to
help me and I was screaming for help, I was being beaten, I was being
kicked around and, again, bounced off of walls. And all of a sudden the
room next door became very quiet. Nobody, not one person came to help
me.]{.font4}

[The greatest complaint the next day is the fact that there was bruises
on my body. So many people say that, in]{.font4} [Deep Throat,]{.font4}
[I have a smile on my face, and I look as though I am really enjoying
myself. No one ever asked me how those bruises got on my body.]{.font4}

[Mr. Traynor stopped searching for me because he acquired Marilyn
Chambers, who I believe is also being held against her will. A reporter
from a Philadelphia newspaper did an interview. His name is Larry
Fields. During the course of the interview, Ms. Chambers asked for
permission to go to the bathroom and he refused it. Mr. Fields objected
and said, why don't you let the poor girl go to the bathroom, she is
about to go on stage? And he came back with, "I don't tell you how to
write your newspaper, don't tell me how to treat my broads. "]{.font4}

[I have also been in touch with a girl who was with Mr. Traynor two
months prior to getting me, who was put through a similar situation but
not as strong. And as it stands today, she still fears for her life and
the life of her family. Personally, I think it is time that the legal
system, in this country realize that one, you can't be held prisoner for
two and a half years and the next day trust the society which has caused
your pain, and resume the life you once called yours. It takes time to
overcome the total dehumanization which you have been through.]{.font4}

[It is time for something to be done about the civil rights of the
victims and not criminals---the victims being women. But realize,
please, it is not just the women who are victims but also children, men
and our society.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you for your testimony, Ms.
Marchiano. I would like to say, because of time again, there are those
who are a little irate that they are here thinking that they would have
the opportunity to participate in this public hearing by getting in a
comment. So I think we are going to have to be expeditious in terms of
questions and answers, we should move this right along so we give people
who are here this morning, who will not have the opportunity this
evening, to have their day to speak. So would you begin?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, I will try to do that. Ms.
Marchiano, I have to ask you some questions that are difficult for me to
ask and I apologize to you for asking them. It is important that we get
the answers. Could you describe for us the first time that Mr. Traynor
prostituted you?]{.font4} 

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It happened in Florida. I had thought we
were going to visit a friend of his, and we pulled up to a Holiday Inn.
So my second reaction was a buffet, I thought we were going to lunch.
And he took me up to a room, and there was five men in the room, and
\[he\] told me that I was there to satisfy each and every one of them.
And I said that I wouldn't do it, so what he did is he took me into this
little dressing area and he told me that if I didn't do it, that he
would shoot me. And I said, you won't shoot me, there is five men in
this room. You just won't do it, somebody will say something and do
something. And he just laughed hysterically. He said that my body would
be found and I would be another prostitute who was shot in her hotel
room or something like that, and that none of the men would do anything.
They would just laugh.]{.font4}

[During this event, I started to cry, and while these five men were
doing whatever they wanted to do, and it was really a pitiful scene
because here I was---they knew I wasn't into it. One of the men
complained and asked for his money back because I was crying and I
wasn't the super freak that Mr. Traynor usually brought around. And he
was given back his money. And the other four men proceeded to do what
they wanted to do, through my tears and all.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Ms. Marchiano. One of the major
themes in pornography is that women are portrayed having intercourse
of---doing various---]{.font4}

[COUNCILMEMBER PATRICK DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you speak into
the mike, ma'am?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [One of the situations that is commonly
portrayed in pornography is women being---women having sexual
intercourse and doing various sex acts with animals. You were forced to
make such a film. Could you describe for us the situation in which you
were forced to make this film?]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you like to respond?]{.font4}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I think it is important that everyone
understands.]{.font4}

[Prior to that film being made, about a week, Mr. Traynor suggested the
thought that I do films with a D-O-G, and I told him that I wouldn't do
it. I suffered a brutal beating. He claims he suffered embarrassment
because I wouldn't do it.]{.font4}

[We then went to another porno studio, one of the sleaziest ones I have
ever seen, and then this guy walked in with his animal, and I again
started crying. I started crying. I said, I am not going to do this, and
they were all very persistent, the two men involved in making the
pornographic film and Mr. Traynor himself. And I started to leave and go
outside of the room where they make these films, and when I turned
around there was all of a sudden a gun displayed on the desk and having
seen the coarseness and the callousness of the people involved in
pornography, I knew that I would have been shot and killed. Needless to
say, the film was shot and still is one of the hardest ones for me to
deal with today.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. I am sorry but this is something
that I had to ask. There was one other incident that you described in
your book]{.font4} [Ordeal]{.font4} [that involved Mr. Hefner, Hugh
Hefner at the Playboy Mansion, that was about the same theme. Would you
tell us briefly about that?]{.font4} [\
]{.font7 .sgc-1}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. Well, we first met Mr. Hefner. Mr.
Traynor and him sat around discussing what they could do with me, all
kinds of different atrocities. And it seemed that Mr. Hefner and Mr.
Traynor both enjoyed seeing a woman being used by an animal. And so Mr.
Hefner had Mr. Traynor's dog flown in from Florida to the L. A. Mansion.
And one evening they decided that it was time and they had one of the
security guards bring the animal down to Mr. Hefner's bathhouse and
fortunately, during my two and a half years in imprisonment, there was a
girl that tried to help me in her own sort of way. She told me the
tricks to avoid that kind of a situation, and I did what I could to
avoid it, but Mr. Traynor and Mr. Hefner were both very
disappointed.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Would you explain to us how it was
that Mr. Traynor taught you to do what is now known popularly in this
culture, because of the movie]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4}[, as the
sex act of deep-throating?]{.font4} 

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, he used hypnotism. He told me that it
would overcome the natural reflexes in your throat that would prevent
you from gagging, and it was through hypnotism that I was able, I guess,
to accomplish the feat, I guess you could say.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So that hypnotism was added to the
prostitution?]{.font4} 

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, it was.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My final question is this: some people may
think that you could have gotten away, for instance, when Mr. Traynor
was sleeping. Could you explain to us why that was impossible?]{.font4}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, at night what he would do is put his
body over my body so that, if I did try to get up, he would wake up. And
he was a very light sleeper. If I did attempt to move or roll over in my
sleep, he would awaken.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [How do you feel about the existence of the
film]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4} [and its continually being
shown?]{.font4}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I feel very hurt and very disappointed in
my society and my country for allowing the fact that I was raped, I was
beaten, I was put through two and a half years of what I was put
through. And it's taken me almost ten years to overcome the damage that
he caused. And the fact that this film is still being shown and that my
three children will one day walk down the street and see their mother
being abused, it makes me angry, makes me sad. Virtually every time
someone watches that film, they are watching me being raped.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right. Catharine, do you have another
witness?]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We were going to allow the space for a
member of the public who was given the wrong information. She is not
part of what we were going to proceed with. We thought it was best to be
more brief with Ms. Marchiano so that this woman could speak.]{.font4}

[We have a couple of documents to submit.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [May we do that first?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We will submit these and then this woman
can speak.]{.font4} 

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mrs. Marchiano, for showing
up.]{.font4}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. I would like to say, thank you
for everybody who made it possible for me to be here tonight. I want to
speak out for what happened to me and for other members in our society.
I feel that it is important that victims have a chance today in our
society. And I also want to say that my children thank you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to just put into evidence, in
support of Linda's testimony, we will be providing you with a copy of
her book]{.font4} [Ordeal,]{.font4} [which tells the facts. We are also
providing you with a copy of her lie detector test that bears out the
truth of everything that she has said to you today. \[Exh. 3\]]{.font4}

[In addition, I would like to read a letter by Dr. Kathleen Barry who is
a Professor of Sociology, and who is an author of the book]{.font4}
[Female Sexual Slavery.]{.font4} [We will also put this into evidence.

["In this memo I intend to identify the practices related to pornography

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Ms. Dworkin, I would like to---I hate
to continually talk all the time, if you could just submit them for the
record. The media, if they wish them, they can get them from the
committee clerk and so we can move right along.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. There is one other point I want to
make. I won't read the whole letter. I will tell you we have a letter
here from a New York crisis worker about the increased existence of rape
of the throat since the distribution of the movie]{.font4} [Deep
Throat]{.font4}[. And in addition the increased use of cameras in actual
rape situations. \[Exh. 5\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are going to move quite quickly
now. Ms. Marchiano, I want to thank you for coming to testify.]{.font4}

[MARCHIANO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We have Dr. Pauline Bart, who will
utilize as little of the time that has been allotted to her, if she can
make it precise as possible, I would appreciate that. We do have
speakers and it is rather long. We will give people an opportunity to
speak for three minutes. We have a young lady out here with a baby. I
would like her to go first after Mrs. Bart. Dr. Bart is a Professor of
Sociology, Abraham Lincoln Medical Center, University of Illinois,
Chicago\....]{.font4}

[DR. PAULINE BART:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have spent the last twenty years
studying gender, studying what happens to women and what happens to men
and women and children, because of the problem of gender inequality in
this country. Beginning with depressed middle-aged women, Portnoy's
mothers, what gynecologists say about women in their textbooks, and
abortion.]{.font4}

[For the past ten years I have been studying rape and rape avoidance.
This was a study funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. In
the course of focusing on rape and the injury it causes, I, as other
researchers in sexual assault such as Dr. Russell and Dr. Scully, ^5^
realized that we had to learn about pornography for reasons I will
discuss below.]{.font4}

[I must say that it is a pleasure to be in the Minneapolis/St. Paul
area, which has in so many ways led the way in having data-based public
policy on preventing child sexual assault, on battery, the study on
arresting the batterers, having the first women's shelters in this
country. I hope fervently that will follow with pornography. My pleasure
is increased by the knowledge that my city celebrated Hugh Hefner Day
last week.]{.font4}

[My presentation will deal with the following themes: pornography as
harm to women, including its use to socialize men in gender and
inequality, very briefly critiques of studies which purport to show that
pornography is harmless, and the study of audience response to a film
about pornography, data which clearly indicates that women believe
pornography injures us as a class.]{.font4}

[When I first came to the University of Illinois Medical School and I
sat in on a sex education class, I learned that they were, and I saw
that they were, being shown pornography to desensitize what they might
hear about in their practice. I know there are some of you that \[think
that physicians\] are insensitive enough as it is. And, of course, most
of us are aware that as part of medical school education\... physicians
were shown pornographic slides intermixed with the ordinary anatomy
slides to liven up the lectures. Professor Myra Marx Ferree at the
University of Connecticut told me, and I then called her on December 6th
to get words that I could use for you, that when they went around to the
various dorms to tell them the relationship between pornography and
violence against women, particularly rape,\... one of the male students
made an argument that pornography was not harmful. In fact, they were
interested in getting the porno films on campus at the beginning of the
fall semester, because the freshmen guys did not know how to relate to
women, and you have to show them. And they said that, you know,
Professor Ferree was talking about the relationship between pornography
to bad things. You're talking about relationships to normal men, not to
rape. It is really about normal sex. So I think that the use of this as
a teaching device should be something we should investigate.]{.font4}

[A recent study by Strauss and Baron, University of New Hampshire,
\[studied the\] relationship between the sales of sex magazines and the
rate of rapes reported to police from the crime reports, and they found
that "pornography induces attitudes that increase the likelihood of
rape. " The correlation in '79 was. 63 and the correlation in 1980 was.
58. For those of you who are familiar with the social science
literature, these are substantially high correlations.]{.font4}

[The work \[of\] Zillmann, who had been mentioned before, showed that
explicit sexual behavior films shown to students over an extended period
showed that, at the end they---the ones who saw the films---were more
hostile to the women's movement, that is to the equality of women, and
suggested lower sentences for rapists than those who saw neutral films,
or saw half neutral films and half sexually-explicit films.]{.font4}

[Diana Russell, who I mentioned before, in her random sample of women in
San Francisco found that 10 percent said "yes" when she asked them,
"have you ever been upset by anyone trying to get you to do what they
have seen in pornographic pictures, movies, or books? " Now, maybe they
were wrong, and the guys didn't get the idea from pornography. On the
other hand, similarly maybe they were asked to do things that they did
not]{.font4} [know]{.font4} [came from pornography. So the 10 percent
figure is one we can become comfortable with.]{.font4}

[Let me tell you some of the things that they had been asked to do
because of pornographic pictures, and this was by their husbands and
boyfriends. And on the basis of some prior research I did, I can tell
you that research done by people we trust, excuse me, that sexual
assault done by people whom you trust is worse than sexual assault done
by a stranger. Your trust, your judgment, everything about you is
violated more than if you have the kind of rape that everybody would
agree is a rape.]{.font4}

[As may be clear from some of the quotations cited, there was often
insufficient probing by the interviewers to determine the exact nature
of the unwanted sexual experience. That is, the number of clear-cut
cases reported is likely to be a considerable understatement. And we
can't, of course, prove by this that the pornography caused this kind of
behavior, but it is like the relationship, in this case, the
correlation, between smoking and cancer. I would suggest that these
women, as well as the women in my study that I will talk to you about,
may well \[experience\] what is called Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome in
the diagnostic and statistical manner which we are veterans in the cases
of, which we are very familiar with. They have nightmares, loss of
appetite, the kind of things that women who are \[injured\] have
experienced, and it goes on for a long time. Let me talk a little bit
about the women in my study, and then I will talk about the attitudes in
response to Linda Lovelace's story.]{.font4}

[I spoke to forty-three women who had been raped. Many of the men denied
that what they were doing was raping. One man said, "I am not raping
you, you are raping me. " And another said, "You entered this place of
your own free will. " And one man said, "There is no such thing as rape.
" Now, sociologists, you know, use big words to explain things, and the
word we use is neutralization. It is used to justify the kind of
behavior originally that was enjoyed by juvenile delinquents, and it
involves denial of responsibility and denial of injury.]{.font4}

[Now, denial of injury was the most common rationale the men used. Let
me tell you what the women told us that the rapist said: "You are going
to enjoy this" as he raped her at knifepoint. "I know you won't mind
what I do to you, " as he was displaying a gun. "I don't want to rape
you, I just want to screw, " as he locked her in his room penetrating
her anus and vagina with his fingers. "You know there is no such thing
as a rape, a man is doing a woman a favor. " This is a man who had
conned a woman into his apartment and forced her to have oral sex and
masturbate him. "You are going to feel good, I am going to penetrate
you, " said a cab driver viciously trying to rape his passenger. Said he
"wanted to make love" but if she did not cooperate, he would kill her.
This was said by a naked man, holding a knife, mounted on a sleeping
woman. He left saying, "Here I was trying to be nice. " He also said
that he was shy and it was too bad that they had to meet this way. And
the last quote is "You will feel better when I am inside you. "]{.font4}

[Now, men aren't born believing this. They have to learn it someplace,
and I maintain that one of the ways they learn it is through
pornography. The women told me that frequently they were asked or
demanded to state how much they were enjoying the rapes and]{.font4}
[that]{.font4} [was harder for them to do than the act, than
experiencing the actual rape.]{.font4}

[One of my friends was raped with a gun to her head and her rapist
insisted that she have an orgasm. He then wanted her to have another
orgasm and then backed down. He said, well, she might be a little tired
from the first one. As if rape itself isn't enough of an injury, these
women were further injured by the lie which academics call ideology.
That women enjoy forced sex and enjoy forced pain---and this is the
ideology that is presented in pornography. That is one of the reasons
that I got into studying pornography.]{.font4}

[The third part of the study that I am going to report, third study, has
to do with audience research on "Not a Love Story. " Before I do so, I
want to simply briefly recapitulate what Professor Donnerstein said
about the \[1970 President's\] Commission Report.]{.font4}

[There were two \[reports\] that came out the same time, one on violence
and one on pornography. The one on violence was based on ordinary
learning theory, which is a substantial theoretical perspective inside
psychology. And the theory is, the more you see, the more you do. The
one on pornography, however, came out with a different explanation, the
catharsis model, which was, the more you see, the less you do. And as we
have been so eloquently spoken to, there is absolutely no data for the
last analysis.]{.font4}

[I have written a paper which I think has been submitted to you called
"Dirty Books, Dirty Films, and Dirty Data" that addresses the issue. And
all I can say is that if any of my students ever did any research as
shocking as that research which has been so quickly picked up and put
into textbooks and is still there---you ask people what they think and
do, where they learn that pornography was harmless---I would feel that I
had failed as a teacher. If indeed it were true that the catharsis model
is successful, then since we have had a proliferation of pornography, we
should have a diminution of sexual assault and rape, and that is
certainly not the case.]{.font4}

[I did the only study, to my knowledge, that has been done on a more or
less national audience. That is, I didn't use students in my class and I
didn't call a group together. I studied people who went to see "Not a
Love Story, " a film about pornography. The ads just said "a film about
pornography. " Word got out that it was an antipornography film, but not
everyone who came to see the film came thinking that. I did not have a
random sample, and I certainly would not claim that I had a random
sample. However, that in a sense strengthens my findings, because the
sample was biased in exactly the way that would be associated with
people who would be pro-pornography. They were young and they were well
educated compared with the general population. And we know from prior
research that this group generally has a more permissive attitude
towards pornography.]{.font4}

[I read this in]{.font4} [The New York Times]{.font4} [yesterday. They
apparently removed from the park a bronze entitled "Playmates" showing
three boys gazing at a centerfold of a]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}
[magazine. In the centerfold was a black view---excuse me, a back view,
also a black view---of a woman wearing a scanty negligee. There was
opposition on some part of the communities and kids were seen giggling
about it. And the sculptor said, "Actually the piece was not designed to
have kids elbow each other and giggle. It was to have adults reminisce a
bit about this stage of their development/' I suggest that it did not
allow the women to reminisce a bit about our development.]{.font4}

[Okay. What I want to basically tell you, and the rest of the stuff is
submitted, will be submitted, is that what I have found in \[studying\]
"Not a Love Story.
"[]{#minneapolis1.xhtml#footnote2}^[2](#minneapolis1.xhtml#bookmark2)^\...
\[It studies\] the audience over a month period. My findings were that
men and women have very different attitudes towards pornography. Men
didn't like it very much and women hated it. There were particular
differences on two issues. One was that pornography has---the question
was: Do you think pornography has its place? Women and men really split,
with most women saying no, it didn't. They strongly disagree.
Seventy-two percent disagreed strongly.]{.font4}

[On the question of rape, some of the increase in the rate of rape can
be attributed to pornography, 81 percent of the women agreed and 51
percent of the men agreed.]{.font4}

[The \[Society for the\] Scientific Study of Sex has changed. When I
showed the film "Not a Love Story" and had a panel with Donnerstein,
Malamuth, Stock, and Abel, even in this group I found there were similar
differences between males and females. There were 40 percent of the men
strongly agreeing that there was a place for pornography but only 11. 5
percent of the females agreeing. \[Exh. 6\]]{.font4}

all swim.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Pauline, one second.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think for the sake of time, Chairman, in
order to preserve as much time as possible to the public, I won't ask
for any other questions.]{.font4}

[I will submit one document, which is a letter from a doctor who
recently went to a medical school and found pornography still being used
in the training of gynecologists in sex education, to document that it
is still going on. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I want to thank you. I was out of the
room but I will tell you and the audience that there are speakers in all
the other rooms. We are not slighting anyone when we are running back
and forth. It is now public hearing time and there is a lady here with
her child who wishes to speak. And what is her name, Jane Strauss. I
would like to say three to four minutes in your presentations so that we
can move right along, we are getting close to the time that we are
supposed to be breaking, we may have to go over a little bit.]{.font4}

[If you will begin by giving your name and address to the stenographer
and to the committee clerk.]{.font4}

[JANE STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [First of all, thank you very much, Mr.
White, for making this possible. We were a little confused about times
here and the baby is getting a little restless.]{.font4}

[I am Jane Strauss, S-t-r-a-u-s-s. I live at 3120 Third Avenue South. I
am coming here with two concerns, and I will try and be as brief as
possible.]{.font4}

[The first concern is, I am a parent trying to raise a child in South
Minneapolis. Just recently, well, at the present time the place where we
live is within five blocks of two pornography stores and two health
clubs, 24-hour girls in lingerie. I have some concerns from that
standpoint. I have some concerns in that my husband and I own some
legitimate bookstores in which a small, very small percentage of what we
carry, which is asked for by some of our customers, is things which
might be considered to be pornography under this ordinance. And I have
some concerns with regard to that, with regard to small business people
who are trying to survive as compared to the Alexanders who make their
living exclusively from the pornography, degradation of men, women, and
children.]{.font4}

[I have read over the proposed ordinance several times. I have shown it
to my spouse who, say what you will, he appears to be a man, but who is
an attorney by training, and to several other attorneys whom I know,
some of whom are women. One of my concerns is that this deals only with
pornography per se. One of the major concerns that I see is the presence
of prostitution and, yes, pornography may encourage that. There is no
direct provision with regard to the presence of prostitution in this. I
am concerned about that, I am concerned about probable discriminatory
stuff. The definition which is given in the ordinance points to
degrading pictures of women. It is women in this and women in that. We
have here men, seen in]{.font4} [Buns,]{.font4} [available in B. Dalton
or lots of other places. We have gay-oriented pornography. I find this
offensive. It is not covered. We have]{.font4} [Playgirl.]{.font4} [That
is men. My God, I don't think it is that great. It is stuff that is
commonly available. It is stuff that you can get at the local magazine
wholesaler, at the local book wholesaler in this town.]{.font4}

[I also have some concerns that violence is no less violent because it
is violence against men. That focusing on a male crotch as an essence of
that person is not less demeaning than focusing on a female crotch or
breasts. I have some concerns about that.]{.font4}

[The second thing---another thing I have a concern about is that no
distinction is made between a full-line bookstore or convenience store
that has]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4}[,
maybe, and an operation like that owned by the Alexander Brothers,
\[in\] which their primary purpose is peddling pornography. I think
there is a distinction in kind of those two. You may disagree, but this
is my concern.]{.font4}

[Another concern that I have is that, for example, if three out of 20,
000 titles are offensive to somebody in a full-line bookstore, the
person who owns that bookstore is still liable to suit. From a purely
practical viewpoint, it is not physically possible to read absolutely
everything that you stock in that store. I will show you. These are
romance novels. The current trend in category romance novels is for
increasingly graphic things. Many who are thinking women would find
those quite offensive. I do. On the other hand, there are women who buy
and devour three or four a week and this is the market at which these
are aimed---young women, sixteen to forty, or sixteen to thirty-five,
many of whom are housewives and things like that. I don't just think it
is real appropriate.]{.font4}

[I am concerned that this could possibly open the way for a large number
of suits at personal expense against general bookstores for a very small
percentage of what they stock, rather than against those people who make
their living primarily selling pornography---who are, I might add,
better able to defend themselves and better able to afford an attorney
than the independent bookseller is.]{.font4}

[I don't know how many of you know about the bookselling
business.]{.font4}

[It has a small margin of profit. It is hard to make a living by a
legitimate bookstore.]{.font4}

[I am concerned that if a number of the cases go to court, it is not
likely to help the calendars in court. I don't know that this has been
properly addressed. I am concerned that it appears that written suits
need to be about specific books or magazines. What happens if one of
these pornography bookstores had thousands of titles? Do you have to sue
over each title individually? It seems unwieldy to me. It seems
difficult to enforce.]{.font4}

[I have another concern on the statute of limitations. To give you an
example, the statute of limitations on medical malpractice, including
assault by a physician, is two years. I do not think that it is
appropriate to have a longer statute of limitations on the crime of
peddling pornography than of the crime of physically assaulting a woman.
I was assaulted by a psychologist. When I fought back, I was told by an
attorney, when I got up enough nerve to sue for malpractice, too bad, it
was two and a half years ago. You have no cause of action.]{.font4}

[I also have some concerns that in addressing movies, again I don't
know, and I wonder, I ask for your, you know, whatever, for your
enlightenment, what the effect will be on R-rated movies, which I may or
may not choose to see, which do run in the downtown houses. There
doesn't seem to be any distinction drawn between those and the specialty
pornography houses. I am concerned about the lack of distinctions in
this legislation.]{.font4}

[Finally, I consider this a good start, perhaps meaningless, it seems to
me the city has abrogated its police power to be forcing women to spend
their own money in order to live in safety, in order to keep themselves
from being harassed in walking by the places. I have a problem. I like
to put the baby in a baby buggy and go down to Sears. I have to pass a
number of these places, and I am not ready for the harassment outside.
The City Council would say, yes, women, we give you the right to get the
money to bring suit yourselves. We are not able to do anything for
you.]{.font4}

[I grew up outside of Boston. I have some questions as to why \[the\]
combat zone seems to work there. They are under the same Constitution as
we are, last I heard, and yet for whatever reason, it has not been
applied here.]{.font4}

[And in conclusion, I would like to encourage the Committee and the
entire Council to consider carefully some of these questions I have
raised. To consider very carefully the wording in this, so when you pass
something relating to pornography, and hopefully relating to
prostitution as well as pornography, that you will pass something that
will have teeth and not force the victims to come up with the money to
defend themselves. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you stay so you could
respond?]{.font4}

[You know I may not address everything, you did a lot. As to what you
say, the discriminatory stuff and the things you say would not be
covered. The intention of this ordinance is to cover, as pornography,
one, women, because that is where the strongest data is as to the
relationship between women in pornography and concrete harms and abuses
towards women, but also as to cover, as pornography, men, children, and
transsexuals when they are used in the place of women.]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, I think it should be made a little
clearer. \']{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And we accept your saying that it should be
a little clearer. In fact, I accept that. I will do that.]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Very good, thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The second question that you made as to the
difficulty of the legitimate booksellers making a living, part of the
hope here is that by allowing people to sue, principally women,
traffickers in pornography, that there will be an alteration in the
competitive atmosphere. That is the view. In other words, that women
know how hard it is to bring suits that will stick, and we all know who
the traffickers of pornography are in the city. And what we are thinking
is that it is important that there not be exceptions, so that
pornography can always be available even if because it is only sold in
small quantities. In other words, it is just as harmful if you get it at
the town grocery store or at a store like yours. If one gets it from
there, then it is just as harmful in grocery stores as it is if it was
bought in the emporium bought by the Alexanders.]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to address it briefly. I don't
know if you are familiar with the current thing in category romances.
Frankly, I find those highly offensive and yet there is a very
large---those of us who own stores and make our livings from them would
very much like to not have to carry this, but there are a large number
of women in South Minneapolis who have very little in the way of brain
and like this garbage. I can tell you how many we sell.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [This is not a debate. This is a public
hearing.]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have initiated your concerns. There
has been a response of what?]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am responding to her that we wish we had a
guaranteed income. We do have a large number of customers who are
regular customers who we can't afford to lose who like this kind of
category romance and we can't afford not to carry them.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are not going to go into debate,
from now on we are going to hear public testimony that will be put in
the record and we will not---except from the committee members, if they
wish to ask a question. But have no responses. I want to thank
you.]{.font4}

[STRAUSS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I wish to thank you and I wish to thank those
of you who were respectable and those of you who were not, I wish
to---]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let's go on.]{.font4}

[Richard Alberta, you have the floor, three or four minutes.]{.font4}

[RICHARD ALBERTA:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Richard Alberta, I live at 4617 East
36th Street. I am a freelance editor for a private journal here in
town.]{.font4}

[In less than two weeks, I have heard three different explanations on
the research on pornography and violence. Dr. Elizabeth Rice Allgeier, I
sent that testimony to the council last week, said we lack conclusive
evidence regarding this issue. Professor MacKinnon said there is a
concreteness between exposure and violence. And scientific works on the
subject seldom, if ever, use the word causality but rather talk about
correlations or results of studies. Which suggests, in other words,
different people look at the same data and come up with different
conclusions. Today is a perfect time to clear up some of those
conflicting conclusions. Now, most of the conflicts deal with words, two
words in particular, attitudes and aggression. So, I have organized the
conclusions within the scope of these two words.]{.font4}

[Number one, aggressive pornography and attitudes. The Malamuth and
Donnerstein study of 1982 listed studies regarding this but studies with
conflicting results. On the one hand, Malamuth and Check suggested that
exposure to films of films showing "aggressive sexuality as having
positive consequences tended to increase acceptance of male rape myths.
" On the other hand, another study, Malamuth et al., 1970 found no
evidence of changes in attitudes. So one study says yes, another study
says no.]{.font4}

[On the second and last point, aggressive pornography and aggression, in
the laboratory when a female researcher angered a male, the aggressive
pornography increased his aggression towards her. However, aggressive
nonpornographic exposures also increased aggressivity toward female
victims.]{.font4}

[With regard to the last category of studies, this question has been
asked: How do these effects go to outside nonlaboratory conditions?
Malamuth and Donnerstein, alluded to before, said "while laboratory
experiments provide a useful framework for determining whether
aggressive pornography can affect aggressive tendencies, there is a need
at this point to examine the extent to which such stimuli actually exert
and impact in naturalistic settings. "]{.font4}

[Parenthetically I might add that although we have been told the
\[quantity\] of pornography is increasing and this increase should
result in more violence in women, the incidents of rape in Minneapolis
have not been increasing since 1973. In fact, in 1981---between '81 and
'82 there was a 7. 3 percent decrease in rape in Minneapolis. So this is
a complex issue as well as an emotional issue. For the benefit of the
Council members and audience today, I hope that some of these
complexities can be addressed here today.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[Is there anyone that can't be here before 5: 00 that wishes to speak?
We do have a break scheduled. Is there anyone that can't come at 5: 00
and continue the testimony?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The dozen people on the list can all come
at 5: 00.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They can?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They can and they will be there.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, Councilman Hoyt?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [If there is no one signed up on the list---as
long as there is no one signed on this list, who indicated that they
can't be here at 5: 00, I think the whole audience and the committee
might be able to stand the break that we have scheduled. So I would move
that we recess until 5: 00.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [On the motion, all those in favor say
aye.]{.font4}

[SESSION II: MONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1983, 5:00 P. M.]{.font3 .sgc-1}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Who will speak here?]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER TOM BEAVER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think all of us
will.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Since there are four of you and I
notice three on this list, who else?]{.font4}

[HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are also expecting Cliff Greene. He will be
in shortly. He is an attorney. He has extensive knowledge in the area of
civil rights.]{.font4}

[BEAVER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And Sharon Warwick may not be on that list
that you have in front of you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [She is not on here.]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER SHARON WARWICK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I was on the other
list.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What other list?]{.font4}

[WARWICK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The Civil Rights Commissioner's.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We need a quorum. Will you please come
in Council-member Howard or Daugherty or Dziedzic. The quorum being
present, we will reconvene the hearing on the Pornography
Ordinance.]{.font4} 

[COUNCILMEMBER SALLY HOWARD:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Councilmember Howard?]{.font4}

[HOWARD:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to announce, before the public
hearing was called a couple of months ago, I agreed to give a speech at
the League of Women Voters Meeting at 7: 00. It is not because I am not
interested. It is because I can't cancel out on a different
speech.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. We have members of the Civil
Rights Commission here who are with us. I am going to allow them to
speak briefly with their tentative statements. They will also have an
ample opportunity in two days to prepare their concerns or agreements on
the ordinance. And at this time, I will allow them to
participate.]{.font4}

[Whomever wishes to go first.]{.font4}

[BEAVER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Tom Beaver, Chairman of the Civil Rights
Commission. We, as a Commission, have not had an opportunity as a
Commission to fully discuss and talk about this ordinance in a
Commission meeting. So as of today, we are unable as a Commission to
give you a yes or a no on this issue of our support.]{.font4}

[We have some very serious questions. One, how is this going to affect
our department and our resources to implement other aspects of the civil
rights ordinances. And before I can give you a yes or no on the support,
we need to have a meeting and we have successfully arranged a meeting
between the makers and your consultants which will take place. And after
that meeting, we will be making a prepared text to let you know of our
support or nonsupport. It would be unfair to tell you yes or no on our
support tonight.]{.font4}

[We would like to let you know that we do have some concerns and we will
talk those out with your consultants, and with Charlee Hoyt on
Wednesday, when we meet with everyone. I sense in the conversations that
I have had with other members, the support is not full and complete for
this amendment, and I think that it might be because of some lack of
knowledge on our part on what this amendment is going to do and how it
is going to operate.]{.font4}

[Until that meeting, until we get our questions answered, we will hold
off on formal testimony for you and present it at other hearings. Other
members of the Commission have things to tell you and some of their
concerns, and I will let them go ahead and explain their
testimony.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Councilman Hoyt?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I appreciate the fact that the Chairman is
making it possible for a meeting of the Commission to take place. It is
my understanding that when our meeting was set up last week with the
Executive Director of the Civil Rights Department, I made an automatic
assumption that that also meant the Commissioners, and I found out right
away that it didn't. And it was hard to call you at 9: 00 o'clock and
say, would you like to come to a meeting at 10: 00 o'clock. I did call
Mr. Beaver. It is a misunderstanding on my part. They would have had
full access earlier.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. I would ask you to be as brief
as you possibly can because we do have some that have waited over to get
whatever they wish into the public hearing setting.]{.font4}

[You may go ahead with someone, whoever wishes to go.]{.font4}

[WARWICK: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [am Sharon Warwick, Commissioner of
Minnesota Commission on Civil Rights. I have a few problems with this.
First of all, I would like to say that I am against pornography, since
over half the proposed zones are in the area where I live and my friends
live and where we shop and do business. I am very much concerned with
what is going to happen within the city. I am not going to speak to the
First Amendment rights. I think there are a lot of other people who can
speak to those issues better than I can.]{.font4}

[I have a problem with the ordinance and how it is written. I feel it is
somewhat discriminatory, particularly with part]{.font4} [g]{.font4}
[which defines the word pornography. I don't believe that it should be
exclusive to women. I am also very much concerned about how this
ordinance will be enforced, and the fact that we will need more staff,
concerned about whether or not people realize that it is going to
involve a lot more staffing for the department. I think there is a
misconception, perhaps, that this ordinance will close the bookstores. I
am not sure that that would happen.]{.font4}

[I am also concerned about the time that has been spent on this
ordinance. As the Commission, we have not been approached at all
regarding this ordinance, and I find that rather troublesome when in
fact we are the people who are to be concerned with civil rights in the
city. And it was almost a surprise when we received the ordinance in the
mail. We had naturally read about it in the media, but no one had ever
contacted us regarding the ordinance itself.]{.font4}

[I am not sure that this particular ordinance belongs with civil rights.
I think that there might be other forums that would deal better with
pornography than the Civil Rights Commission. I would like the City
Council to consider that carefully.]{.font4}

[Again, I am concerned about the time. I hope that we don't rush into
something. I think this does need more study and I am concerned that the
full council should get time to study all of the testimony that is taken
here today. I guess I might like to suggest tabling the matter, if it
should come to that point, and give us time to work with it and to talk
it over more. Thank you.]{.font4}

[RICK OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, my name is Rick Osborne. I
am also on the Civil Rights Commission. I won't promise to be brief, and
I hope the Chair will indulge me because you have heard a lot of
testimony this afternoon. And I believe that, because this is an issue
that is so new to the city, having just surfaced publicly some five
weeks ago, and which potentially involves cost to the city of thousands
of dollars to prosecute and enforcement costs, assuming that it is
passed and upheld on the part of the Commission, that you will give me a
few minutes to discuss with you my concerns.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Osborne, I don't want to be
capricious. I would like you to limit your remarks to three or four
minutes.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am on the general speakers' list. If I
don't make it now, I will talk then too.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You are not going to double up on me
like that.]{.font4} 

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, I will try and make it quick, Mr.
Chairman.]{.font4}

[I should point out to the \[Committee\] that I don't speak on behalf of
the Commission. This is my own opinion. The same goes as Assistant
Criminal County Attorney in the Criminal Unit and the Appeals Unit. I
have had experience as a counselor for the runaways for victims of
pimps. I have some experience and expertise in those fields.]{.font4}

[My underlying personal commitment is fighting discrimination against
women and all the groups protected in our ordinance. My philosophy is
that no matter how noble and good that end is, we must use means
to ]{.font4}[fight and accomplish it that are fair and just and, most
important, legal. And I don't believe this ordinance meets any of those
criteria.]{.sgc-2}

[One of the consultants who worked on the preparation of this ordinance
said in her introduction today, "The First Amendment is not useful to
us." Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, it is that attitude that has been
prevalent on the part of our country's history. Who would deny freedom
of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion\[? \] The First
Amendment was designed to be inconvenient to people who would suppress
public debate in the country. So, I don't have much sympathy of the
drafter because she has that opinion. This Committee must not allow
legal objections to be ignored by the simple assertion of some that this
hearing is merely to find facts. I have specific objections to the
proposal itself.]{.font4}

[First, semantic objections. The phrase "graphically depicted" is
legally meaningless and this is a dilemma that you as a Committee have
to recognize in that language. I feel that phrase is so overbroad so
that the following articles will be banned because they are sexually
explicit and subordinate women. I am going to use a definition of
sexually explicit as something on a person's face, that refers to their
sex. Subordinate refers to a lesser position, either physically or
power. And graphically depicted merely means expressed or obvious. If
that very admittedly broad definition is used, it could be used to cause
the following to be banned.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [One second. Be aware that it is simply not that
paragraph. It is that paragraph plus one of the nine references that
follows it. So in the ordinance, it would not apply if it were simply
the one without the others.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I understand that, but that is the initial
threshold requirement. The matter must meet that definition before it
can consider the others.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It has to have one of the other nine with
it.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I understand that.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It can't stand alone.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I understand. With that understanding I
suggest that is---it is possible that somebody can try and bring an
action against the Commission for the following materials: from Geoffrey
Chaucer,]{.font4} [The Wife of Bath's Tale]{.font4}[, "He took his wife
in his arms and kissed her, overcome with joy. Thereafter she obeyed him
in everything that might add to his bliss, and thus they lived for the
rest of their lives in perfect happiness. " It is sexual, it refers to
her as a wife, as a woman, that is explicit. It
obviously ]{.font4}[refers to her explicit capacity. She is definitely
subordinate. Bear in mind it refers to the woman being subordinate
because she has to obey the man, and which of the other nine criteria
does it need? By someone's definition that she is being treated as an
object, a thing, or a commodity, it might mean that she is being
presented in a posture of sexual submission because we don't know what
he meant, Geoffrey Chaucer means, when she is overcome with joy. The
problem is, we don't know if that material is going to be covered by
this ordinance. That is taking a broad definition.]{.sgc-2}

[What if you narrowly define sexually explicit subordination of women as
it has to display genitalia or some sexual act, as we understand it.
Then I would suggest that the following material, which is objectionable
to me and I am sure many of the people that are backing the ordinance,
would not be banned. First, the cover of]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4}
[magazine which shows a pair of presumably women's legs in a meat
grinder, this would not be banned because there is no display of sexual
genitalia. We don't know if those legs are women. The album cover with a
woman's black and blue body of bruises would not be covered, as I
understand it, there was no show of sexual acts and---]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let me say this. First of all, as I
asked earlier on, this is not a debate and your comments, whether you
agree or disagree is not necessary. This is input. This is going into a
document. This is very serious business. He is stating an objection to
it, possible objection. There will be those that will speak in the
affirmative for what has been stated that he objects to. Let us not get
into a hair-raising aspect here. This is not a circus. We will let
everyone say what they have to say and get it over with.]{.font4}

[Go ahead.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Finally, I would suggest that if a narrow
definition of that phrase is adopted, that any item in which the woman
is physically above, especially a man in the process of committing a sex
act, would be bannable under that ordinance. I don't think that that is
desirable. Because I also have here, and I will give it to the
Committee, a photograph which appears in this week's article of]{.font4}
[Newsweek]{.font4} [magazine. It is a classical statue in which breasts
of the woman are displayed and genitalia of the man are displayed. The
man is physically in the position of preeminence over the woman in this
statue, and I suggest that that would be banned, and I don't think that
this Committee wants to get into the position of doing that. I would
submit this to the Committee for whatever weight you want to give
it.]{.font4}

[Now, the whole problem with the definition being vague is- from the
merchants' point of view. You heard from a young woman who runs a
legitimate bookstore. She has materials she didn't know would be covered
or not. The merchant is faced with a choice, either he or she has to
guess that a book or magazine that is being sold in that bookstore is
going to fit the broad definition and therefore, get rid of it, or they
can take the risk that it would not fit a narrow definition and sell it
and run the risk of prosecution. It is exactly that choice that a
merchant has to make.]{.font4}

[The First Amendment is designed to protect that chilling effect of
uncertainty because a rational prudent business person is not going to
carry the item and it won't be available.]{.font4}

[I have one final legal objection to this, Mr. Chairman, and that is
that this particular ordinance just plain is not needed. We have civil
remedies for the victims of assault in the form of court actions for
assault and battery. If someone such as Ms. Marchiano was, appears, in
movies and she doesn't want to be in movies, she can bring an action in
defamation of character or privacies. We have nuisance laws that govern
a business that harasses passers-by. They can be shut down if we have
the will to enforce them. They are on the books.]{.font4}

[We have zoning laws, which doesn't get rid of pornography. To begin
with, at least you will allow the First Amendment to come into effect.
There are criminal statutes, my office prosecutes sexual assaults. One
of my most---one is when I prosecute sex offenders, they are hideous
crimes. We can use the laws on the books to take care of them. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I appreciate your concerns. Perhaps if we added
the word genitalia we could make it so that it is definite. I hope you
will take some advantage of being able to press that in the meeting that
you are all going to have, to find out if it does. And I plan, if at all
possible, I plan to be there.]{.font4}

[I caution you one thing. That is, almost every past civil rights
ordinance that I have seen has had people in opposition saying the laws
were already on the books that could be used. I can appreciate your
concern. I would not want to have culture accused of being pornographic,
and I believe you will have an opportunity to probe that in
depth.]{.font4}

[And again, my personal apologies. It was my ignorance of not knowing
that the Civil Rights Commission should be there when the Director was,
or you would have had that opportunity prior to public hearing
time.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Councilmember, I appreciate that. I guess my
position would be even if the definition is drafted more narrowly, I, as
a Commission member who will be sitting on at the complaint hearings for
this, don't want to be in the position of a community hearing censor. It
is impossible for any of us, no matter how far it is drafted, to
separate out what is bannable and what is art. The Supreme Court has
consistently said that.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [This is strictly for a public
hearing.]{.font4}

[Ms. Laurence?]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER WANDA LAURENCE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Wanda
Laurence. I am with the Civil Rights Commission. I am speaking oh my
personal opinion, and I am kind of uncomfortable with testifying because
of the fact that I have a very close friend that was raped. And the man
said, when he admitted the fact that he did rape this friend of mine,
that he had just come from a pornographic movie. And I am giving this
testimony as my own personal opinion, not necessarily the views of the
Commissioner or anybody else in my neighborhood or the
audience.]{.font4}

[I live in a neighborhood that is very, very much inundated with
bookstores and theaters that show porno movies or which is usually
advertised as porno movies or porno books. Because of the fact that I
sit on the Commission, I feel like I have a right to testify just as
much as you people do. Also because of the fact that I am on the
Commission, I want to make sure that the way it is written, the
ordinance, something, is written that will not be challenged in court,
\[and\] that it will ban or greatly reduce the amount of pornography
that is happening not only in my neighborhood but in other areas.
Because I really feel that it not only adversely affects and attacks and
dramatizes the life of a woman, it affects youth, it affects men, it
affects everybody in some way or another. It affects a person regardless
of age. There is a lot of child pornography, there is a lot of
pornography that affects women, and I think the majority right now that
I have been made aware of, that has been what people complained about,
is the fact that it affects women more than it affects most of the other
people. Right now I tend to agree with that.]{.font4}

[But I find a problem with reading this thing as to whether we can
implement it monetarywise. I think that the way it is presently written,
it will be challenged in court by the people that have a lot of money to
be able to afford to take it into court. And a lot of it adversely
affects \[us\] whether we have been attacked or not. And I think that
adversely affects us, this porno stuff, and most of us I daresay in this
room can't afford financially to take anybody to court that shows this
kind of stuff, sells this kind of stuff or whatever. We just can't
afford it. Grassroots people especially can't afford it.]{.font4}

[Most of these places are located in areas that are in grassroots or
places where a lot of grassroots people go. It happens to be that that
is where most of the people have put these things and allowed a license
to occur. Most of these places are in the neighborhood that I live in
and I am really, really opposed to them being there. First Amendment
right or any other amendment right, I am opposed to them being
there.]{.font4}

[I know it is adversely affecting my neighbors who are renting. I speak
for a lot of people in my neighborhood. They can rent a lot of the
facilities there because of the fact that there is so much porno in our
area. People are afraid of being hassled when they are waiting for the
bus, and a lot of places where they are waiting for the bus is right
outside of these places. I really, really resent that the bus stop is
there. For those that want to patronize the place, if they want to
patronize the place, that is fine. I resent them being in my
neighborhood, a good share of them.]{.font4}

[Also, I am opposed to the fact that Charlee \[Hoyt\], she explained,
but people were calling me and asking me my views as to how the Civil
Rights Commission would handle this type of a thing when I hadn't even
received a copy of it yet. I just want to voice my frustration with
that.]{.font4}

[And as far as the ordinance, I would like to not only see some form to
ban this, and especially the effects that it has about women. I would
like to see an ordinance change occur where these all aren't located in
one area. And from what I have been told, they are going to be located
in either downtown or else in commercial areas. And I live not too far
from Lake Street which means we would probably get more than we already
have. I don't know where they are going to put it. I am afraid that
every time someone vacates, they are going to put it there.]{.font4}

[One of the people that lives next door to me recently said that
she---]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Can you wind it up?]{.font4}

[LAURENCE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [One of the people that lives next door to me
said that her sister was raped and that they recently arrested the
person that did it. I live not too far from where \[the\] person that
committed the crime lives. It is getting so that I am afraid, and a lot
of people that I have talked to from various parts of the city are
afraid to even go out at night.]{.font4}

[I believe the way it is written now, some form has to be drafted up,
written, that can pass without a phenomenal court battle, that will not
only help women so they can feel safe out there, but help other people
that have to put up with this pornography stuff.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER CLIFFORD GREENE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Members of the Council,
my name is Clifford Greene. I am in my second term as a Civil Rights
Commissioner. I will try and be as brief. I understand the Chairman does
not want to get into a great deal of substantive debate. I will merely
raise the concerns that entered my mind upon reviewing this ordinance
when I did receive it.]{.font4}

[I appreciate \[Councilmember\] Hoyt's comments that the exclusion of
input from the Civil Rights Commission was not intentional. I look
forward to meeting with the officers of the ordinance. I think we might
have some constructive input for all of you later in the week.]{.font4}

[I am an attorney and I represent municipalities other than the City of
Minneapolis and have drafted and interpreted local obscenity laws. I am
also an adjunct professor of law and teach a civil rights course at
William Mitchell, serving as a full-time law professor there two years
ago.]{.font4}

[I make my comments mindful of the evils of obscenity and pornography
and also the concern about the need to balance the First Amendment
rights. As an individual member of the Commission, my concerns are
primarily that I would be asked to adjudicate disputes that exist in
coming under this discrimination ordinance. I am very, very careful, as
are all of the members of the Commission, to apply the law in a
consistent manner so people know what the standards are.]{.font4}

[As I read the ordinance, the standards are not self-explanatory to me.
I look forward to talking with Professor MacKinnon and her colleagues
regarding the intention of the drafters of the ordinance, so perhaps we
might be able to find some language that would give those who have to
adjudicate these disputes, as well as people subject to them, an
indication exactly what the standards of liability would be.]{.font4}

[I give an example of the concern I have, without resolving it here. We
can discuss it later. That is a situation where there is a book
containing a character where there is a prostitute and, for one reason
or another, enjoys being so. The prostitute character may or may not
reflect the opinion of the author that prostitution is good, bad, or
indifferent but may, in fact, be a character in the book to generate
thought about a particular issue, perhaps even the issue of
discrimination against women in our society. I am concerned that I will
be asked to interpret the intent of the author, is this character truly
expressing an idea or attitude towards women that is harmful and
discriminatory. So, I am concerned about how to deal with that kind of
problem and troubled by the possibility that I may be asked to construe
these kinds of dilemmas. And I ask for guidance from the authors of the
bill regarding what they had in mind.]{.font4}

[In addition, I do have some questions about whether or not the
standards as written are constitutional. As currently written my
impression, and I state only an impression because I do not purport to
be an expert on obscenity, is that they probably are not, but they might
become so. And I would be very interested in hearing the strategies that
Professor MacKinnon has in mind for defending those particular
ordinances from the attacks that will inevitably occur. They will occur.
If the attackers are successful, they will get attorney fees under the
Civil Rights Act. Therefore, I think we should anticipate a costly
battle but be ready to defend one in case it occurs. In particular, my
concern is about how the regulation of pornography will enable us to
reach types of expression that is not considered obscene under Federal
definitions of obscenity.]{.font4}

[The courts have allowed us to regulate obscenity, to ban it,
criminalize it, zone it, whatever. It is my understanding, and perhaps I
misunderstand, that the intent of this legislation is to allow us to
create a cause of action for expression that may not be obscene but is
harmful because it is pornographic. I would like to understand how this
particular approach to the regulation of pornography would be
constitutional whereas other approaches to widening the definition of
obscenity are not.]{.font4}

[I am concerned also about the impact of this proposal on the current
operations and objectives of the current Civil Rights Commission. We
have been very busy. We take our mandate seriously to make sure that all
citizens of the City of Minneapolis have an opportunity to raise their
concerns, be they legitimate conflicts, perceived conflicts, or whatever
regarding discrimination in housing and in a variety of other
activities. I want to know what the impact of our involvement as a
Commission will be on other very important activities, such as our
efforts to assure affirmative action and our efforts to assure that
housing is made available to all and that none of the protected classes
receives any less attention because of our ability to now deal with the
new issue.]{.font4}

[Another concern that I would like to discuss with the authors of the
legislation is why this legislation is aimed at the local level. I am
aware and have previously assembled the multitude of obscenity laws that
are enacted by the federal and state authorities and that are on the
books. I wonder whether the intentions of this legislation is to say
these agencies will not enforce those laws or saying that these laws are
inadequate. It seems to me that there are some tremendous advantages to
forcing obscenity laws via state and federal legislation because they
can cross jurisdictional lines. They can deal with issues such as the
making of pornographic movies which may not be made in our particular
city.]{.font4}

[And finally, I would like to understand what the supporters of the
legislation hope this legislation will accomplish. It is very important
that we not create unrealistic expectations. If the purpose of this
particular legislation is to assure that we do not have certain types of
pornography exhibited or made available to children or others, I would
like to understand that. If the purpose, however, is the expectation
that this ordinance will do away with adult, I use the term loosely,
bookstores, I think that expectation is unfounded. I think that,
fortunately or unfortunately, depending on what your reading pleasure
may be, that the adult bookstores are not going to be closed by this
ordinance. We are required item by item to take a look at particular
materials.]{.font4}

[So those are the five concerns that I have, that I hope we have a
chance to discuss. And I know I for one will attempt to be as helpful
and as receptive and as willing to learn this area as I will be willing
to contribute.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Alderman Hoyt?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will leave most of those for when you have the
meeting. However, being one of the major authors, I will tell you it is
in Minneapolis for the same reason that we seem to have had a sexual
preference \[law\], which is not at state levels or other levels. It is
here not at the choice of the consultants we have hired, but at the
request of the committee, who in an open public hearing was considering
a zoning ordinance on bookstores. Her testimony concerned civil rights
of women and, at that point, the committee requested our City Attorney
to talk with the people that we have now hired as our consultants, to
help us construct that ordinance. So, it is in Minneapolis at the choice
of Minneapolis and at the choice of this committee, which said we would
like to pursue this and to look into it.]{.font4}

[I am sure you can go into more depth when you get in to your meeting
specifically. But do be aware someone did not bring this, other than
this committee asked for it, and we fortunately have some consultants
around.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to hitchhike on what
Councilmember Hoyt has said. That is the reason it is before this
committee. In zoning and planning they came in with the possible zoning
in various aspects of the city, leaving out some. There was a cry
throughout the best part of the cities that had those points or sites
designated as being the recipient of pornography.]{.font4}

[One of the things that everyone here has to understand, the victims are
crying out, "what about us? " whether it is burglary or whether it is
rape, whether it is any kind of act that violates the human aspects of
our society. They are saying, "what about us? " And what they are asking
is justice for all.]{.font4}

[OSBORNE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White, in my case I missed a point
that I wanted to bring to the Council's attention. Many of the
underlying sentiments that I am hearing on behalf of the proponents of
this proposal are that the attitudes that are infused in our culture,
that men have perpetuated violence against women, I don't disagree with
that at all. What I would draw to the Committee's attention is that the
same sort of attitudes of silence and hatred and empathy have been fused
in our culture against gay and lesbian people as well. I don't want the
source of that hatred propaganda by evangelists, I don't want that
banned by the marketplace either. I want the Committee to know
that.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, thank you. We will now continue
on with the--- would you take your conversations in the hallway, please,
if necessary. We are going to take this yellow sheet, it only has a few
more on it. I will allow them three minutes and then we will go to the
proposed sheet of those that wish to speak.]{.font4}

[So would you give your name?]{.font4}

[TIM CAMPBELL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Tim
Campbell. I am here to testify today as a member of the gay male
community. I believe that what should be significant to the public and
to the City Council and to the Commission as they consider this type of
ordinance is that the gay male community has been systematically a
target for sexual assault as women have been.]{.font4}

[I testify today as a gay rights activist who sat in a cell block for
fourteen days with four rapists in this very building. I have been the
victim of sexual assault three times at the hands of men and once at the
hands of women. There is a sexist bias that says the act of violence
perpetrated against men is not sexual assault. I beg to differ with that
sexist thinking.]{.font4}

[In the course of twelve years working full time as a counselor, a
comforter, a theoretician and an activist, for twelve years we have
worked from the theory that what is going on at the University of
Minnesota is the most effective cure for sexual ignorance and for the
violence that results from sexual repression, sexual frustration and
sexual ignorance.]{.font4}

[As much as I empathize with Linda Lovelace, I believe that this
ordinance will be more dangerous than helpful to Linda Lovelace and her
kind. Linda Marchiano, victimized under the name of Linda Lovelace, came
to the name of freedom under the name of Linda Marchiano and a new body
of language.]{.font4}

[Basically you heard a lot of testimony this afternoon that amounts to
telling you that things lose shock value after you repeat them a number
of times. I am here to tell you, any drag queen could have told you
that. Sure, the more times you see a rape on TV, the less shock value it
will have. That doesn't prove anything.]{.font4}

[Basically we agree on goals. I would like to see queer bashing stopped.
I would like to see sexual assault against women stopped. I fear,
however, this ordinance will only increase the amount of weirdo
pornography coming out from the makers. In the last twelve years there
has been a change in the production of gay pornography. In early 1970 it
was difficult to find anything but really sleazy, shoddy looking models
and a whole lot of abusive stuff in gay male pornography. With the
movement towards liberation and greater access and larger market, normal
adult males consenting in adult sex, there is more of it than there was
in 1970.]{.font4}

[In the recent couple of years, a negative reaction to the current drive
against pornography, violence in pornography, have what I consider an
artificial production of "we will show you, " thumb \[your\] noses type
of pornography, like the cover of]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4} [that shows
the woman going through the meat grinder or the woman's legs going
through the meat grinder. I believe that is temporary. I have great
confidence in the long run that, as you heard today, these women want to
use this ordinance to stop things like the sexuality seminars that are
going through and Bart testified that is what she would like to stop.
That is what she testified. She objected that medical students were
seeing things they called pornography.]{.font4}

[I can't tell what will be pornography by reading the ordinance
proposed. I can assure you I can find four paragraphs in the ordinance
to bring suit against the Bible. Cinderella is a myth that would not
pass the test. In fact, I defy, I invite the City Council members to sit
down now and write a three-sentence story involving a woman and sex that
would pass the test of this ordinance. I don't think you would be able
to write anything.]{.font4}

[So, I would ask you, one, I believe that this ordinance as proposed is
a threat to civil rights. Others pointed out that it is blatantly
sexist. It is un-American, it is fascist, it is antisexual and it is
antiheterosexual. Basically, the missionary position is no longer
acceptable storytelling. The only thing you can do is Jack met Jill,
maybe, and neither one pursued the other one, and they lived happily
ever after, is the only love story you could write now. I would ask the
Council to send it back and put this kind of litigation somewhere else.
Don't erode the concept of civil rights with this concept.]{.font4}

[ROBERT HALFHILL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Robert Halfhill and I live
at 125 Oak Grove, Apartment 45. I am opposed to the ordinance also as a
gay activist. I will comment first on the ordinance.]{.font4}

[It states that pornography shall include the sexually explicit
subordination of women, graphically depicted, whether in words or in
pictures in conjunction with one or more of the following. And then one
is, women are presented as sexual objects, things, or commodities. That
might seem to be a very narrow definition as came out of this hearing
today. It turns out that even though members of this antipornography
movement will deny that they are against erotica, when it actually comes
down to examples, anything that is sexually explicit is viewing women as
sexual objects, or commodities, and so forth.]{.font4}

[We had someone testify, to the calendars of nude males coming out. She
also said gay pornography is offensive to her and she also referred to
romance novels which some people might consider pornography. Just the
fact that "one or more of the following" would mean that this ordinance
would cover anything sexually explicit.]{.font4}

[But I am more concerned with the following. This movement against
pornographic bookstores has had a terrible effect on the gay community.
There have been three thousand arrests, according to the Twin Cities
readers of gay and adult bookstores, under the liberal administration.
And every time we go in to talk and complain to the Police Chief about
it, he says, "I am getting it from the other side. "]{.font4}

[So the point I am making is that this movement against the bookstores
has been one of the factors, perhaps not the only one, one of the
factors that led to the arrest of three thousand gay men with the police
brutality and insult of police and so forth. One example. We had one
police officer, and this will have to be a sexually explicit quote, we
had a police officer beat a gay up and he said, "You mother-fucking
faggot, if I ever see you around here again, they will find you in the
river and your own mother won't be able to recognize you. " What I am
here to announce publicly, if this movement doesn't stop the arrest of
gay men, we are going to have to retaliate in some way. It is just as
easy for us to picket the pornography on U of M campus as it is for
women to picket pornographic bookstores. If it doesn't stop, that is
what we are going to have to do.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Councilmember Hoyt?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could I first reiterate to the audience, one of
the best things we have in our society is the right of people to testify
before their government and make their feelings known. No one should be
put down for expressing their thoughts and their views before this
Committee, and I would appreciate it if we could honor that.]{.font4}

[EUGENE CONWAY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Eugene Conway, Senior. I am the
state president of Morality in Media in Minnesota, Incorporated. We are
the state affiliate of the national organization of Morality in Media. I
had to leave early and I just got back and I don't know a lot of the
things that have transpired.]{.font4}

[But our organization is the organization that brought out the minority
report of the Presidential Commission and also that was taken in the
place of the majority report. Our state organization is 100 percent in
favor of this ordinance. We have a few questions about the problems that
might come up later on with regard to the constitutionality of the
ordinance, but we are generally---in fact, we are in favor of the
ordinance. ^8^]{.font4}

[Sitting here this afternoon, one thing I would like to bring out, we
have a long legal constitutional history of obscenity and pornography in
this country. In 1957 the]{.font4} [Roth]{.font4} [decision of the
Supreme Court stated very categorically that obscenity is not free
speech. Now, this is aimed not only at women but men and every person in
society. Those of you that are active in this movement also know that in
1973 the]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [decision of the Supreme Court gave
us about seven or eight activities that may be obscene.]{.font4}

[The other point I would like to bring out, it was mentioned several
times, is we don't have a definition of obscenity. For those of you that
follow this closely, I am sure you know the three-prong test of
obscenity that was brought out in the]{.font4} [Roth]{.font4} [decision
and reaffirmed again in the]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [decision.
Obscenities are actions, words, or shows, depictions, descriptions of
activities, from the]{.font4} [Roth]{.font4} [and reaffirmed by
the]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [decision, which would, taken as a whole,
appeal to the interest in sex. This is the first standard, the first
prong \[of the\] test of obscenity.]{.font4}

[The second is that the obscene activities, whatever they might be, must
be patently offensive, as we know meaning very evidently\] that way. One
of the justices didn't know how to define it but "I know it when I see
it. "]{.font4}

[The third prong \[of the\] test is that, taken as a whole, that these
activities must lack those four famous values: literary value, artistic
value, political value, and scientific value. We also know from]{.font4}
[Roth]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [that none of us in
ourselves can decide what is obscene. That must be done by our peers in
a---by a jury from the jurisdiction.]{.font4}

[I would also like to point out one 6ther fact which is very heartening.
That was recently, two months ago, the President set up a coordinator,
Mr. Boch, to coordinate customs in the FBI and post offices in enforcing
all of our Federal laws.]{.font4}

[I would like to, as a citizen, maybe ask one question, maybe to Mr.
Hyatt or to Professor MacKinnon. We have had a lot of experience in this
area. How do you feel that ordinance can cope with the city ordinance,
the interpretation of]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [through the]{.font4}
[Wilke]{.font4} [decision and the Supreme Court decision. How do you
feel your ordinance will relate to these? Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Hyatt, you can do that in a
written answer.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will be happy to
do that.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[THERESA McDERMOTT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Theresa McDermott,
M-c-D-e-r-m-o-t-t. I live \[in\] downtown Minneapolis.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Three minutes, please.]{.font4}

[McDERMOTT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right. I am a peace activist. I think
these hearings were very revealing today for the state of our society.
We have a Civil Rights Commission that didn't take the trouble to come
to this morning's hearings that were upon a very serious matter. They
say they have so many other things to do. We are 51 percent of the
population. You have rape, abduction, imprisonment, the maiming of our
women, if that isn't bad enough, the pollution of the minds of the men
of our society. What is this society going to come to when they can't
see the differences between pornography and a love story, between
erotica, nudity, sexuality, and by far deviant behavior which is
punishing us because we don't have the political power to fight
you?]{.font4}

[How many women sit in the Senate of the United States? How many women
ever have? We are 51 percent of the population, I will repeat once more.
We are now talking of the possibility of a black man being President in
the United States. Black men, I suppose since blacks are 10 percent of
the population, are five percent.]{.font4}

[We as 51 percent of the population are sick and tired of walking down
the street and seeing our names and our faces and our bodies defamed and
depicted in this way. The title on your little piece of paper for your
citizens to see says "Government Operations Committee. " We want to be a
part of the government and we want to have some right to define what we
are.]{.font4}

[The definitions made in literature, as someone pointed out, some ten or
fifteen years ago in Sexual Politics ^9^---if you haven't read it I
suggest you do---the way we are defined is, as in literature, it is
everywhere and done all by men. Just in the last ten or fifteen years
have we had the ability to do it ourselves.]{.font4}

[We want the filthy bookstores out. We want the freedom to walk in the
streets. We brought you men into your lives, and every one of you has a
mother and a daughter and a sister, and where would you be without us?
We don't do this to you, and we demand that you stop doing this to
us.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The Chair would like---I notice that
the hands were pointing this way. And the Chair, being a male person, I
would like to let everyone know that I haven't participated in that kind
of activities that you wish to abolish. And I also want to say I
recognize the fact that over the years in the history of this United
States that the course of civil rights is very difficult to come by.
There are now cries that are coming from women of color saying, "what
about us? " So you better recognize that those that are the majority of
women, that women of color are beginning to say "what about us. " Go
ahead.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to say, starting January 2nd or
3rd, whatever date Council takes effect, there will be seven women on
the Council, which is a majority.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, go ahead, Alderman Hoyt.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to point out that we all recognize
that this is strictly not \[a\] male/female division in society---that
there are many, many men who definitely do support the equal rights of
women and the recognition of their civil rights.]{.font4}

[PAUL PRICE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Paul Price. I live at 2707
Garfield Avenue South and I will speak very briefly.]{.font4}

[I have a loosely informed background, however, I think one that is
personally well thought out and rather conscious. I find that, in
particular, in the list of nine points whereby this proposed ordinance
action accusing pornography and the violation of civil rights, in
particular number one, is very ambiguous. And I think it can be easily
substantiated through any discussion you have on a very well practical
level as to the definition of those terms. And I fear, because of the
ambiguity, as other speakers have mentioned, the possibility of great
harassment due to a very wide perception of just what it takes to be a
negative sexual object. And thus, you must then be concerned with the
recipients of that type of harassment.]{.font4}

[I am trying very hard to be an artist. And I would find myself somewhat
ill at ease with the selection of material that may come to my mind. I
think that relates also to the points that Dr. Donnerstein earlier this
afternoon was addressing and describing, his research concerning the
crux of his studies, using, as he defined it, sexually explicit
aggressive pornography and that concerning activity between consenting
adults. I don't find---as he strove for, I believe, in his research, he
set that distinction forward. I don't find that forwardness here. With
clarity, as one of the members on the Civil Rights Commission addressed,
the clarity of the chilling effects.]{.font4}

[I would also like to inquire, as it is my very uninformed understanding
of the laws in society. It is my belief there are activities that humans
involve themselves with in varying levels of abuse, in varying levels of
the way their behavior affects other people. I think in following the
logic of this, I as a resident living next to a bar or a liquor store,
might legitimately follow the points of this ordinance and ask that the
City Council provide for me the means to sue the purveyor of some
alcoholic beverage as their drunken behavior somehow violated my civil
rights. I would like to inquire, this is part of what I think or how the
area will begin to broaden itself out, and I would hope that that will
be addressed because I think statistically even a stronger case could be
put forward as the presence of alcohol in our society is on a much more
destructive force as I think most everyone in the psych, therapy could
let you know. With the presence of automobiles, all are activities which
do indeed violate people's civil rights in pursuit of
happiness.]{.font4}

[Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[COUNCILMEMBER WALTER ROCKENSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, there
is a dramshop act where a person who has been served too much alcohol,
and they hit you, and the owner of and purveyor of the goods can be
sued. It is a good analogy in this case.]{.font4}

[STEVE CARLSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Steve Carlson. I am from
Minneapolis. I am not a member of the gay community, but I sympathize
and wish to protect the people and civil rights \[of\] the gay
community. I have often said that.]{.font4}

[I am very sorry to see the conflict that politics are generating. I
hope that we can overcome that here. I will not appeal to any interest
or hatred for one class of people against another, justly or unjustly,
because I understand, and I am not preaching, but I understand that love
is the most powerful force which is operating in this society right now.
I hope that it is operating right here in this room today. It hurts me
to see all of this hatred.]{.font4}

[I was here this afternoon. What I saw moved me very deeply, as I am
sure it did everybody in this room. I have no doubt that at this time
that everybody in this room wants very much to stop the kind of activity
which we were advised of. I have no doubt that we all want to work
together to use the law to further the sanctity of human life. And I
don't mean any religious or ideological overtones by saying that. I mean
it very simply, it is not cool, it is not in any way hip going around
beating off, mutilating women, or subjecting them to this. And anybody
who starts talking about the First Amendment and being glad that it
allows the feeling that somehow it is proper protection, I believe they
do not understand the law.]{.font4}

[Let me get to the point. The point is, we have a job to do. I am proud
to be here in this room with these people, and these people who I am
very glad to meet, and I hope I can align myself with.]{.font4}

[The lawyer over here, the one on the end of the Civil Rights
Commission, brought up some very helpful input as well as did the person
from the media on \[morality\]. There has been a lot of progress, as we
have learned today and know already on obscenity. We should proceed on
the local level. We should proceed immediately to protect the life and
wellbeing of the women and others when they are victims of pornography.
We should act as far as we can within what the law has already provided.
Protections against obscenity, you can even ban it. Obviously that we
have come this far today. It shows we are mindful of protecting
that.]{.font4}

[The new area that has come up today is violence against women. We
must---we had a psychologist who presented new painful but startling and
provocative research and some findings. I wish that all of us would act
together to put into effect what we have come to know through this
research, through the advent of women's studies at the University which
indicates a great deal of hope in this process, in this society, to be
concerned about and appreciate the contributions of women's rights. It
has brought to us its knowledge. We must extend beyond the obscenity
into the evidence. We have to protect property, personal well-being of
women, and that is why I hope that we will get down to work. I thank
you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Now we have had some requests of
personal testimony that has been on the agenda for quite some time, and
I would like to allow those persons who are about to begin to speak to
utilize their three minutes and move on. If there is any questions from
the Committee, I would hope you would hold it brief.]{.font4}

[They will be excused from giving their address because of some of the
degradation that they have suffered. And we don't want you to know where
they live and so forth and so on.]{.font4}

[So if the first person to speak is here, Cheryl Champion, R.
M.?]{.font4} 

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, the people who are going to
speak to the actual ways in which pornography has been used against them
would very much appreciate being able to sit up here.]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is R. M. and I live in the 9th Ward. I
am going to talk about being raped and how pornography was involved in
that rape.]{.font4} 

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [R., could you pull it a little closer?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [When I was thirteen, I was camping with the
Girl Scouts in Northern Wisconsin. It was ten years ago in November. I
was walking through the forest outside of the camp in midafternoon and
came upon three deer hunters who were reading magazines and talking and
joking around.]{.font4}

[I turned to walk away and one of the men yelled, "There is a live one.
" And I thought they meant a deer, and so I ducked and tried to run
away. I realized that there wasn't any deer in sight and that they meant
me. And I started running and they ran away---they ran after me. I
tripped, the forest was covered with pine needles and leaves and they
caught me. And I told them that I would go away, to leave me alone,
please.]{.font4}

[And they said, "You are not going anywhere" and forced me to get up and
pulled my hair and started looking at me up and down, calling me a
little Godiva---I had long hair then---a golden girl, and making
jokes.]{.font4}

[They told me to take my clothes off and I did. It was very cold. It was
November. I took my clothes off, and they told me to lie down and the
first man started. They told me not to say anything, that if I made a
sound that they would kill me, they would blow my head off.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Were they armed?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. All three of them had hunting rifles.
They---two men held their guns at my head and the first man hit my
breast with his rifle, and they continued to laugh.]{.font4}

[And then the first man raped me. And when he was finished, they started
making jokes about how I was a virgin and I didn't know how they knew I
was a virgin, but they did. And they made jokes about this, and jokes
about how they could have used something like this when they were in
boot camp, and made jokes about being in the military.]{.font4}

[The second man then raped me. None of the men attempted to kiss me or
touch my breasts. They simply wanted to have intercourse. When the
second man was finished, the third man was not able to get an erection
and they, the other men, told me to give him a blow job, and I didn't
know what a blow job was.]{.font4}

[The third man forced his penis into my mouth and told me to do it and I
didn't know how to do it. I did not know what I was supposed to be
doing. He started swearing at me and calling me a bitch and a slut and
that I better do it right and that I wasn't even trying. Then he started
getting very angry and one of the men pulled the trigger on his gun, so
I tried harder.]{.font4}

[Then when he had an erection, he raped me. They continued to make jokes
about how lucky they were to have found me when they did, and they made
jokes about being a virgin. They started kicking leaves and pine needles
on me and kicking me and told me that if I wanted more, that I could
come back the next day.]{.font4}

[Then they started walking away and I put my clothes back on and it was
not far from where they had set up their camp, and I looked down and saw
that they had been reading pornographic magazines. They were magazines
with nude women on the covers.]{.font4}

[I went back to the camp---well, first I got my clothes back on and
walked a fair amount away, and then I broke down and cried under a tree
and decided what I needed to do. And I went back to the camp and I
didn't tell anyone that I had been raped. I went to the bathroom and saw
that I had bled on my underwear, so I assumed that I had gotten my
period. I did not know that virgins bleed. I didn't find that out until
a few years later.]{.font4}

[I didn't seek any medical help. I didn't tell anyone that I was raped
until I was 20 years old.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Had you seen pornography before?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you say how?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My father and my older brothers all had
pornography. They kept it under their mattresses and under their beds. I
had looked at the pornography that was in my home when I was growing up.
When I was a young child I assumed that that is how it would look when I
grew up.]{.font4} 

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So you recognized the magazines as being
basically the same kinds of magazines that you had seen in your
home?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Absolutely.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What do you remember about what you were
thinking they would do to you at the time?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [When I was being raped, I thought they were
going to kill me. I assumed I wasn't going to live through that, that
this was what they were going to do to me before they killed
me.]{.font4}

[HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me, what went through your mind when you
decided not to report this?]{.font4}

[MS. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, in retrospect I realized that I felt
like I needed some control over what had just happened, that I didn't
feel like I could tolerate anyone and having them think it was my fault
or blaming me or not understanding. And to have no control over who had
that information once I told someone, knowing that my mother would most
likely tell a great deal of people and I would have no control over that
information.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are finished.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, thank you. I recognize that was
difficult with all the ears that were here, for you to sit here and make
that kind of statement. Thank you. I will probably say this to them all.
It takes a lot of guts.]{.font4}

[E. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1}[\... I live in the 10th Ward.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Will you bring the mike up?]{.font4}

[E. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[I am afraid to be here. I am also afraid not to be here. In thinking
about coming here today to speak, I realized that my life would be in
danger. As a woman of color these dangers seem many and great---an
absolute loss of credibility and respect, wrath and disgust, potential
violence both verbal and physical, and ridicule and harassment, to name
a few. I also realized the dangers to my life if I did not come. These
dangers being complacency, letting go of my rage and terror about
pornography and its impact on my life, accepting that the shame is mine,
accepting that I am the slut and the whore that deserved what was done
to me, believing that I am useable. I have no illusions about men not
seeing me as a slut. They do. They see all women as sex itself, even the
ones they venerate. But I also want to say to you that I have no
illusions about my refusal to accept that I am and must always be these
things.]{.font4}

[I want to tell you how pornography has affected my life, how I am
fighting self-loathing, disgust and shame, how I am fighting at the
beginning, and how I am fighting tearing out my skin.]{.font4}

[The first thing I want to talk about happened when I was three years
old. When I was three, I was sexually abused by a fourteen-year-old
neighbor boy. I would tell you it seems really bizarre to me to use the
word "boy, " because the only memory I have of this person is as a
three-year-old. And as a three-year-old, he seemed like a really big
man.]{.font4}

[I was told by him and some other neighborhood kids, which also included
his sisters, that we would be playing a secret game. They told me that
it was safe and that they had played it before and that I had nothing to
be afraid of. What this game consisted of was each child going into a
tool shed with this guy. When my turn came, I didn't want to go in
because I was scared. It was dark in there and it was dirty. There were
cobwebs and there was this giant pitchfork.]{.font4}

[One of the kids pushed me inside and shut the door. Then this boy
grabbed me and he pulled down my shorts and sexually abused me. In
short, he finger-fucked me and he made me masturbate him. I was really
terrified. I thought I was in hell, and I was also in a lot of pain. I
started crying really hard and he finally let me go, but I was told that
if I told anyone, I wouldn't be believed, that it was all my fault and
that I would be punished. He also told me that he would hurt me again if
I told anyone.]{.font4}

[His sister told me that this game he had learned from his dirty books.
I knew that he had these dirty books because I had seen him with
them.]{.font4}

[The second incident I want to talk about occurred eight years ago, and
I want you to know that for the past several weeks I have been living in
hell because for the first time I am remembering this. And, for me, this
memory is my first experience with it.]{.font4}

[About eight years ago, I went to a friend of mine's house for dinner.
She was living with what I call her pimp friend, most people would call
him her boyfriend. Some male friends of hers---of theirs---came by, and
she went out to the store to get something that they had forgotten for
dinner. While she was gone, someone poured me some wine, and after she
came back I drank it. She came back, I started feeling really dizzy and
disconnected, and I wanted to go home. They kept telling me to stay,
that I could sleep there. Everyone was laughing at me. I found out later
that I had been drugged.]{.font4}

[What I remember is this. I am on the couch and everyone is looking at
me, laughing. They are talking about---they started talking about taking
pictures of me. I am not sure they took pictures. I passed out. I do
remember flashing lights and what I do know is that they made and they
sold pornography.]{.font4}

[What I remember next is being on the stage of this club where my friend
strips. I want you to know that I use this term "friend" not with a
whole lot of sincerity. I knew it was this club where she stripped
because I had been there before. I had tried previously to understand
and to accept what it was she was doing, and so I had gone there with
her and her parents.]{.font4}

[I remember being on the stage, and there were two men that were holding
me up and they were taking off my clothes. A third man was sexually
fondling me. I saw a lot of faces in the audience that were laughing and
men were waving money. One of them shoved it in my stomach and
essentially punched me. I kept wondering how it was possible that they
couldn't see that I didn't want to be there, that I wasn't there
willingly. I am not sure what else happened. I have real bad feelings
about what may have happened. Somehow, I don't know how, I got to a pay
phone and I called this friend of mine who came and took me
home.]{.font4}

[You are probably wondering, have I told anyone about this. As to the
incident with my friend, no, I didn't report it to the police. How do
you report something you don't remember? Even when you remember, if you
are a woman, even if you do remember, you are not believed. Even if you
have bruises, you are bleeding, or whatever. I didn't remember anything,
and what could I have reported?]{.font4}

[And I didn't tell anyone about the sexual abuse when I was three
because I was terrified and I was real ashamed. And also because I
didn't have any words to describe it. I didn't tell anyone about that
for 24 years. I confronted my friend about the incident, and she told me
that it was all my imagination. I told her I didn't have an imagination
and I was trying to find one. She laughed. I asked her why I had been
found naked, passed out by the phone, if it wasn't true and she told me
that was a joke.]{.font4}

[Like I said before, I don't know if any of those men fucked me. I do
know that that boy fucked me. I know that, in both instances, I was
violated, and I am not alone in these experiences. There are thousands
of women and girls who are forced and coerced into accommodating men's
degrading sexual pleasures.]{.font4}

[Now you tell me that pornography doesn't hurt women, doesn't violate
us, does not use and abuse us, does not instigate and inspire the abuse
of women. And when I say women, I include children, in particular girls.
I don't understand how anyone can believe it is harmless. I don't
understand how anyone can call this fantasy, a deflection of aggression
against women. I don't understand how anyone can say that this is speech
when actual live women are being brutalized.]{.font4}

[On the other hand, I can understand it because it is men who are saying
this. It is the pornographers who create it, who get the money from it,
who get erections from it, and society shuns this. I want to stop this
for me, for all women and for all girls. There are men here, and we have
heard from some of them, who say that pornography has to exist because
they have a right to it, its pleasure, its so-called political message.
I disagree and I want you to consider this when you make your decision
about these amendments. At what cost does this have to exist? Surely not
at all costs, surely not at the cost of any woman or girl's life and
integrity.]{.font4}

[I am going to urge you for once to look at pornography for what it
really is, a violation of women's civil rights, and I want you to take
action to stop it.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Ms. M.]{.font4}

[MS. C.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is \[N. C. \] and I live in
Ward]{.font4} [14.]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would really like to thank \[E. \]
for saying what she said.]{.font4}

[I am also afraid to be here and afraid not to be here. What brought me
here is that I know a lot of women who have stories to tell about how
pornography has hurt them and how they are trying to recover from the
destruction it has brought into their lives, and that can't be here
because they are still working through a lot of that pain. This for me
is also a way of purging my own shame about this. I would also like to
preface what I am going to say by saying that in my testimony here, I
say fuck three times because I believe in calling something what it
is.]{.font4}

[I was twenty-one years old at the time. It was 1980 in March or April.
I did have a sexual relationship with this man for about a year. He had
gone to a stag party. This particular evening I was home alone in my
apartment. He called me on the telephone and he said that he had seen
several short pornographic films and that he felt very horny. Although
he did make some general comments about the content of these films, I do
not remember what they were at this time specifically. So he asked if he
could come over specifically to have sex with me. I said yes, because at
that time I felt obligated as a girlfriend to satisfy him. I also felt
that the refusal would be indicative of sexual quote unquote hang-ups on
my part and that I was not quote unquote liberal enough.]{.font4}

[When he arrived, he informed me that the other men at the party were
envious that he had a girlfriend to fuck. They wanted to fuck too after
watching the pornography. He informed me of this as he was taking his
coat off. He then took off the rest of his clothes and had me perform
fellatio on him. I did not do this of my own volition. He put his
genitals in my face and he said, "Take it all. " Then he fucked me on
the couch in the living room. AH this took about five minutes. And when
he was finished he dressed and went back to the party. I felt ashamed
and numb, and I also felt very used.]{.font4}

[This encounter differed from others previous. It was much quicker, it
was somewhat rougher, and he was not aware of me as a person. There was
no foreplay. It is my opinion that his viewing of the pornography served
as foreplay for him.]{.font4}

[There were no lasting detrimental effects on me from this experience
alone. It was simply an intensification of the ordinary treatment I
received from him. It \[was ordinary\]---something I feel worth
noting---and this usual treatment did result in feelings of low
self-esteem, depression, confusion and a lot of shame.]{.font4}

[I do not have any knowledge of him purchasing any pornography at any
time in the relationship. I know that the friends he got together with
twice a week, they had it in their homes. He was exposed to it
regularly.]{.font4}

[I feel what I have to say here is important because I feel what he did,
he went to this party, saw pornography, got an erection, got me to
inflict his erection on. There is a direct causal relationship there.
Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[MR. C.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is G. C. I live in the 9th Ward. I
strongly support the proposed ordinance on pornography. I am going to
tell you how pornography affected my life. Obscene is not the word for
pornography. Pornography is dangerous. I was battered by my first lover,
and the pornography each of us used condoned the violence.]{.font4}

[When I was younger, I was exposed to heterosexual pornography,
including]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}[;]{.font4} [Penthouse,
Oui,]{.font4} [and other magazines. It was one of the places that I
learned about sex, and it showed me that sex was violence. What I saw
there was a specific relationship between men and women. The woman was
to be used, objectified, humiliated, and hurt. The man was in a superior
position, a position to be violent. In pornography I learned that what
it meant to be sexual with a man or to be loved by a man was to accept
his violence. When my lover was violent, I was taught that the violence
was normal. I accepted the violence, which I did not like, and it was
some time before I left the relationship.]{.font4}

[My ex-lover used pornography. One of his first contacts with other men
were in gay pornography theaters. He used pornographic magazines before
I met him. He started wanting to look at pornography together. I believe
that the pornography influenced his behavior. As our relationship
progressed, it became violent. He threatened me with a knife, forced sex
on me, and battered me on different occasions. The heterosexual
pornography that I had been exposed to was one thing that convinced me
that this kind of treatment was normal. The battering was one of the
most profoundly destructive experiences of my life. Pornography has
showed me that a man's love was violent and to be close to my ex-lover I
had to accept his violence.]{.font4}

[There is a lot of sexual violence in the gay community, and pornography
condones it. I was with my ex-lover after he had been raped by a casual
sex partner, and my ex said that rape was just a risk you had to take. I
was with a friend after he had been violently raped by his boyfriend,
and his boyfriend did not understand that violence and force was not
supposed to be a part of sex. The objectification and the violent themes
in pornography promote and increase these kinds of violence.]{.font4}

[I understand pornography to be a force in creating violence in the gay
community. I was battered by my ex-lover who used pornography. The
pornography, straight and gay, I had been exposed to, helped convince me
that I had to accept his violence, and helped keep me in that
destructive relationship.]{.font4}

[Pornography is harmful and I want something to be done. The proposed
ordinance provides concrete measures for action.]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is R. M. M. I live in St. Paul. I am
here today to share with you some of the ways in which the presence of
pornography is directly related to physical, sexual, and psychological
abuse in my life.]{.font4}

[My first introduction, before I began in the game of art or more
directly under the guise of art, my earlier recollection is of my
boyfriend and he was an art student. We were sitting together, I
seventeen, he nineteen. He showed me art books and also books, magazines
of pornography. And as he was showing me these works, he was doing
critique of women's bodies, of their facial expression, of parts of
their bodies and of their dress. Following this was a critique of my too
athletic, too muscular body. I was seventeen. It was very devastating to
me that my body was being torn apart in this way.]{.font4}

[Within a year, my boyfriend had a photography assignment, and he came
home from school and asked me if I would help him with his assignment.
When I asked him what it was, he said it was a photography assignment
where he had to photograph a series of pictures in which he had to use a
woman. He said the woman had to be naked and said he thought that I
would want to help him do this. When I objected to doing this, he told
me, he came up with the reply, "You don't want me to see another woman
naked, do you? You never know what could happen, and I really thought
you would want to help me. " He said he had the perfect site, it would
only take a few minutes.]{.font4}

[The next---I was home from school with the German measles at the
time---the next day he picked me up. We went to the perfect site. It was
an abandoned bus in an overgrown field. When we got there he asked me,
he told me, to take off my clothes and to pose in various positions,
either draped over the corroded, rusty seats or in positions where I
acted as if I was running towards the door. And then he asked me to put
my body in contorted different positions, draped down the stairs of the
bus, and they were quite jagged, and at that moment I realized that we
were depicting a murder. I became very terrified and scared and I was
really cold. I told him I didn't want to do this and that I wanted to go
home and that I was really scared.]{.font4}

[While we were doing this, I would like to backtrack for a minute. I
wasn't achieving the right facial expressions for the pictures. So he
started telling me stories that depicted pursuits during rape so that I
would have the right expressions on my face like the women in the
magazines. I remember being very distant from him and just wanting to
get home. I remember being very scared.]{.font4}

[When he had his next assignment, this was about a year later, and it
was casting bodies in plaster. At the time, I told him that I would
prefer if he hired models to do this. On one occasion, I flew out to see
him at college and he said that there were several positions that he
couldn't get the models, that he was paying to model, in, either because
the plaster was too heavy or because the women would start fainting.
When you put plaster on your body, it sets up, it draws the blood to the
skin and the more area it covers on your body, the more blood is drawn
to your skin. You become dizzy and nauseous and sick to your stomach and
finally faint. I tried to explain this to him because I was a pre-med
student at the time, and he said if you would just try to help me with
these, he said, you know, my work is being shown in the current art
shows and it would be a good \[exhibit\] and I would like if you could
help me create these artistic pieces.]{.font4}

[So I told him that I would try. The first few attempts, I failed. He
was very disappointed. I failed under the weight and under the heat of
the plaster. He wanted me to be in poses where I had to hold my hands up
over my head and they would be numb and they would fall. He eventually
tied my hands over my head. Finally he succeeded. He ended up getting a
plaster cast of my body.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you recall if you did faint at that
point or not?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I remember I was fainting as he was pulling
the cast off my body. And he said, it is not quite set yet, hold on, see
if you can hold onto it for a little longer. At that point I think I had
been holding the pose for about 40 minutes. After this he switched to
watercolors.]{.font4}

[At the time, when I was twenty-one, I graduated from college. I was
thinking about going to medical school, and I wasn't receiving a lot of
support at that time for that decision. Women weren't supposed to do
that, was the message I was getting.]{.font4}

[At that time, I married this man, and for the next two years we mainly
pursued our careers. During the second year of our marriage, he started
reading more and more pornography. He started out reading]{.font4}
[Playboy]{.font4} [and started picking up magazines like]{.font4}
[Penthouse]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Forum,]{.font4} [and as I would come
home \[for\] dinner---come home from work and fix dinner--- he would
read excerpts from the magazines. Some of them were articles and some of
them were letters to the editor ranging from group sex, wife swapping,
anal intercourse, and bondage, to mention a few. I was really repulsed
at the things he was reading me and I was really in disbelief. I kept
saying, people are just making these things up for this magazine, I
don't believe it. He bought more and more magazines to prove to me that
people weren't making it up, that all of these people were saying how
wonderful these things were.]{.font4}

[About this time, when we went out we started meeting his friends at wet
T-shirt contests, amateur strip nights or elsewhere---we would meet
together as a group---or pornographic adult theaters or live sex shows.
Initially I started arguing that the women on stage looked very
devastated, like they were disgusted and hated it. I felt devastated and
disgusted watching it. I was told by those men, if I wasn't as smart as
I was, and if I would be more sexually liberated and more sexy, that I
would get along a lot better in the world, and that they and a lot of
other men would like me more.]{.font4}

[About this time, I started feeling very terrified. I realized that this
wasn't a joke any more: that this was something that he was really
serious about. I called my mother and I told her that there were things
happening in my marriage around sex that I really didn't like, and she
told me that divorce was something that she didn't want in our family,
and it was very disgraceful, and she knew how competent I was and she
said, I know you can hang in there and give it your best.]{.font4}

[About this time, to kind of numb myself, I remember that there was a
lot more drinking with my husband and I and with our friends. When
people would come over to dinner, there was a lot of alcohol consumed,
he would bring out a drinking and stripping game. After the game began,
he started to ask the people to live out the various different scenarios
that he had been reading to me in the magazines. A few times, the people
participated in this. A couple times I stayed. Once I left.]{.font4}

[Following this, we would have incredible arguments with each other. I
would tell him I loved him, I only wanted to love him, I wanted to be a
good wife, I wanted our marriage to work, but I didn't want to be with
these other people. It was he I wanted to be with, and no one else. He
told me if I loved him I would do this. And that, as I could see from
the things that he read me in the magazines initially, a lot of times
women didn't like it, but if I tried it enough I would probably like it,
and I would learn to like it. And he would read me stories where women
learned to like it.]{.font4}

[During this time once when I was asleep at night and a friend of his
was over, he asked the friend---he set up with a friend to come into our
room and sleep with us. I woke up finding this friend in bed with us.
Once he realized that I was not a willing participant in this
experience, he apologized to me and said he was sorry and he
left.]{.font4}

[To prevent more of these group situations, which I found very
humiliating and very destructive to my self-esteem and my feeling of
self-worth as a person, to prevent these I agreed with him to act out in
privacy a lot of those scenarios that he read to me, a lot of them
depicting bondage and different sexual acts that I found very
humiliating.]{.font4}

[About this time when things were getting really terrible and I was
feeling very suicidal and very worthless as a person, at that time any
dreams that I had of a career in medicine were just totally washed away.
I could not think of myself any more as a human being.]{.font4}

[Because of his job, we were transferred overseas. When we got to
overseas, the pornography that he was reading and that his friends were
reading was much more violent than the pornography that he had been
reading to me at home. He started taking me to sex shows where there
were women and animals, especially snakes. He started taking me to sex
shows where the women were called "banana lady shows. " We went to sex
shows where men were participating in the sex acts with women on the
stage.]{.font4}

[About this time, he started having to go away a lot and I was left
alone. I started studying karate over there, and I also started feeling
again like I had some kind of control over my body. And I started really
feeling in touch with the fact that I was a person. I started traveling.
I did a lot of traveling by myself and I started feeling more and more
courageous. I went to the Philippines on one of my last visits overseas
and I was there for three weeks. During the time that I was there I was
staying mainly at a Navy base. Outside of that Navy base the
prostitution was very visible and very explicit. Everywhere you went
there were men hiring prostitutes. Those were the only women that I saw
there. I was one of the few American women.]{.font4}

[One night when I was in one of the pornographic institutions, I was
sitting with a couple of people that I had known, watching the women on
stage and watching the different transactions and the sales of the women
and the different acts go on, and I realized that my life wasn't any
different than these women except that it was done in the name of
marriage. I could see how I was being seasoned to the use of pornography
and I could see what was coming next. I could see more violence, and I
could see more humiliation, and I knew at that point I was either going
to die from it, I was going to kill myself, or I was going to leave. And
I was feeling strong enough that I left.]{.font4}

[I spent the next few years of my life, through the help of therapy,
education and friends, healing myself. I would like to forget that the
woman's story is me, but I know those memories and those scars will
remain. Pornography is not a fantasy. It was my life, reality. It
involved abuse to my body to create it.]{.font4}

[If what I said today can help prevent one woman from experiencing what
I experienced, the pain that I was involved in, it is worth it. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to ask you just a couple of
questions. How old were you when you left \[the\] marriage?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I was 25 when I left, and my divorce papers
came through when I was 26.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [How old are you now?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am 29.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I just want to ask you about when you were
married and when you were still in the States. Did your husband talk to
you about making films and making the kinds of things that he was seeing
with you as a participant?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, he did. Both when we would go to the
amateur nights, he would try to get me up on stage and I refused to do
that, and then when he would read through the magazines, one of the
things that became a theme for a while in the magazines were husbands
trafficking their wives, having sex with a friend or some man. And there
would be---I remember various stories, one was about a woman in a cabin
and it was all staged--- how the man would be hiding, how the husband
would be hiding to photograph his wife, and he tried to get me to do
that several times.]{.font4} [DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [During the
period of time, were you actually raped in your marriage?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I was. I actually refer to my whole
marriage as marital rape. But specifically at the time, what I was
considering rape was several times, especially following the incidents
where he asked our friends to come to bed with us after I was already
asleep, following that time he felt that it was his privilege to, when I
was sleeping, if he felt at all sexually turned on or in the need to be
gratified, to rape me in my sleep. Most of the times I would wake up.
Sometimes I would just keep my eyes closed and try to tolerate
it.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So this could happen to you any time when you
were sleeping?]{.font4} 

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, it could happen to me any time when I
was asleep. And several times when I confronted him on this he said if I
refused to have him do this, then he had to masturbate. And as I know
from his religious background, that was a sin.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [When you were actually living in the Orient,
you said that the porn\[ography\] was very much more violent. Could you
describe to us what was actually in it \[that was different from\] what
you had seen before?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. The pornography had mostly Oriental
women in it and black women in it and it depicted women as animals and
had women having sex with animals in it. It was women in cages. There
were a lot of whips. I guess some of them is what they call S and M
pornography. Women were led around with collars. They showed women being
penetrated anally. They showed more gang rapes. It was more abusive in
that the women were not portrayed as these glamorous perfect women, what
I had seen before. They were portrayed more as slaves.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you describe in a couple of words
what you see to be the relationship between the pornography and the
things that your husband asked you to do?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He would read from the pornography like a
textbook, like a journal. In fact, when he asked me to be bound, when he
finally convinced me to do it, he read in the magazine how to tie the
knots, and how to bind me in a way that I couldn't get out. And most of
the scenes that ]{.font4}[we---most of the scenes where I had to dress
up or go through different fantasies---were the exact scenes that he had
read in the magazines.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Did your husband remarry?]{.font4}

[R. M. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He remarried within the year that we got
divorced to a woman that was almost ten years younger than he was. And
at the time I had seen him to finalize things on our divorce and get
some of my last possessions, he showed me pictures of her and said, "Do
you want to see what she looks like? " They were pictures of her naked
and in pornographic poses.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[T. S.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is T. S. I live in the 7th Ward. Before
I start, I just want to say what is happening right now is very
incredible to me, and I know it is very hard for everyone in this room
to be here and to be listening to these horror stories. And I hope that
people stay with their full concentration for the rest of the
evening.]{.font4}

[I am speaking for a group of women. We all live in Minneapolis and we
all are former prostitutes. All of us feel very strongly about the
relationship between pornography and prostitution. Many of us wanted to
testify at this hearing but are unable because of the consequences of
being identified as a former whore. This is absolutely incredible to me
that prostitution is seen as a victimless activity, and that many women
are rightly terrified of breaking their silence, fearing harassment to
themselves and families and loss of their jobs.]{.font4}

[We have started to meet together to make sense of the abuse we have
experienced in prostitution and how pornography endorses and legitimizes
that abuse. These are some of our stories. The following has all
happened to real women who are the exception because they have survived
both pornography and prostitution. We are all living in Minneapolis and
all of these events happened in Minneapolis. And as we sit here, this
abuse is happening right now in the city tonight.]{.font4}

[One of the very first commonalities we discovered as a group: we were
all introduced to prostitution through pornography. There were no
exceptions in our group, and we were all under eighteen.]{.font4}

[Pornography was our textbook. We learned the tricks of the trade by men
exposing us to pornography and us trying to mimic what we saw. I could
not stress enough what a huge influence we feel this was. Somehow it was
okay. These pictures were real men and women who appeared to be happy
consenting adults, engaged in human sexuality.]{.font4}

[Before I go on---one might make the assumption that if a woman got
involved with pornography and prostitution after she was eighteen, that
she is a willing participant. And since the women I speak for were all
underage when they began, it is easier to see them as victims.
Personally, I feel this to be very dangerous. By talking to women who
got involved with prostitution and pornography in their early twenties,
the powerlessness and victimization they described and experienced is
the same that younger women and children feel.]{.font4}

[Here are specific stories we have shared about how pornography
encouraged and taught us and how it was used to brutalize and terrorize
us as women.]{.font4}

[One of us had the experience of being paid by a client to go to a house
located in the 6th Ward. When she got there, she found a group of
physically disabled men and a group of physically abled men. Everyone
was watching pornographic films---movies of men fucking women, women
doing oral sex on men, and women being penetrated by animals. The movies
were played continuously.]{.font4}

[The able-bodied men were joking and making comments like, "That's how
real men do it, " instructing the handicapped men, teasing them that if
they watched enough of these movies they would be able to perform
normally. There were constant remarks made about what normal male sexual
experience was. Then the disabled men were undressed by the abled men
and the woman was forced to engage sexually with the disabled men. There
were two weapons in the room. The woman refused and she was forced, held
down by the physically abled men. Everyone watched and the movies kept
going. There were various physical deformities, amputees, paraplegics.
Some were able to perform. Some weren't.]{.font4}

[After this, the able-bodied men said they were going to show the
handicapped men how "real men" do it. They forced the woman to enact
simultaneously with the movie. In the movie at this point a group of men
were urinating on a naked woman. All the men in the room were able to
perform this task, so they all started urinating on the woman who was
now naked. Then the able-bodied men had sex with the woman while the
disabled men watched.]{.font4}

[Another story is, a woman met a man in a hotel room in the 5th Ward.
When she got there she was tied up while sitting on a chair nude. She
was gagged and left alone in the dark for what she believed to be an
hour. The man returned with two other men. They burned her with
cigarettes and attached nipple clips to her breasts. They had many S and
M magazines with them and showed her many pictures of women appearing to
consent, enjoy, and encourage this abuse. She was held for twelve hours,
continuously raped and beaten. She was paid \$50 or about \$2. 33 per
hour.]{.font4}

[Men would constantly want to do what they have seen in pornography. If
pornography was not actually in the room with the client, there would be
constant reference. One example is that a woman was in a room with two
clients, one man told the other that he had seen some pictures of women
who had shaved their pubic hair and that it had turned him on. They then
proceeded with a jackknife to remove the woman's pubic hairs, plucking
and burning what the knife missed. They made comments of how her
hairless vagina reminded them of their young daughters' genitals. They
then, of course, engaged in intercourse.]{.font4}

[Women were forced constantly to enact specific scenes that men had
witnessed in pornography. They would direct women to copy postures and
poses of things they had seen in magazines and then they would take
their own pictures of the women.]{.font4}

[One man paid a woman in the 6th Ward \$35 to recruit another woman so
he could direct them in a lesbian scenario he had seen in a movie. She
was supposed to recruit the other woman for him. When]{.font4} [Deep
Throat]{.font4} [was released, we experienced men joking and demanding
oral sex.]{.font4}

[It is very amazing to me what happens when a group of ex-prostitutes
get together in one room and tell stories. One of the things we
discovered was that the men we had serviced were very powerful men in
this community. Especially interesting to us are the amounts of men
involved in the media in this community that use prostitutes and
pornography. These are the same men that perpetuate the myth that
Minneapolis is a clean city with exceptional morals and a high quality
of life.]{.font4}

[In closing, I would like to say that, in my experience, there was not
one situation where a client was]{.font4} [not]{.font4} [using
pornography while he was using me, or that he had not just watched
pornography, or that it was\[n't\] verbally referred to, and directed me
to pornography.]{.font4}

[I know that this is a very complicated issue. I am asking you to
recognize the pure simplicity of it. Men witness the abuse of women in
pornography constantly, and if they can't engage in that behavior with
their wives, girlfriends, or children, they force a whore to do it. My
wish is that you could see with my eyes just for a day how clear the
relationship is between pornography and the systematic abuse of
women.]{.font4}

[I would also like to say that I'm petrified and scared for young women
today. I believe the pornography that is published today is more brutal
and dangerous than when I was involved. And because I understand clearly
the direct relationship between the material and the abuse of women, I
am very terrified of the consequences of what that means. I worry about
how this will affect your daughters, who I know will be victims in one
way or another to this pornography. I also worry about the prostitutes
on the street who are currently being used by the pornographic industry.
I know that we are helping them tonight by speaking out and voicing our
outrage and by saying that as adults who believe in human rights and
human intimacy, that pornography is absolutely not acceptable to
us.]{.font4}

[The other thing I just need to stress is that every single thing you
see in pornography is happening to a real woman right now. There is no
way out of that connection, and that we are all responsible for knowing
and having that information.]{.font4}

[I also have a couple written testimonies of women who were not able to
speak tonight for the reasons I already gave.]{.font4}

[This is a story of a woman who works at the University of Minnesota and
could not speak for herself. She was involved in prostitution between
1970 and 1974.]{.font4}

> [I remember a house on Second Avenue South, near 22nd Street which I

>
> [The woman who ran the place actually lived there with her children.

>
> [When I went into that room, the trick said that I was almost too old,

>
> [When I worked at massage studios, the owners had subscriptions
> to]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}[,]{.font4}
> [Penthouse]{.font4}[,]{.font4} [Penthouse Forum]{.font4} [and the

> Although I don't know one way or the other, I have no reason not to

[This is another story of a woman who is currently working downtown in
Minneapolis.]{.font4}

> [I was the main woman of a pimp who filmed sexual acts almost every
> night in our home. The dope man, who supplied us with cocaine for free
> in exchange for these arranged orgies, was a really freaky man who

>
> [One morning I came downstairs in time to see a very young girl run

> involved in the acts; he got off on watching.]{.font4}

[The other thing, very briefly, that I need to address tonight, and some
other women have addressed it, is the specific abuse of women of color
in our community, specifically black women and the Native American women
living here. There is a Native woman, Carole laFavor, who will testify
tomorrow night, who six months ago was brutally raped and beaten. And
the men that attacked and raped her were making continuous comments
about Custer's Last Stand, which is a video thing about these men
chasing a "squaw" and they do things to her. They said, "this is better
than Custer's Last Stand," "let's try the chase scene in Custer's Last
Stand. "]{.font4}

[I want people to know that there is pornography dealing with color, and
that is happening in our community right now. That is all I have, unless
there is questions.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Ms. S., may I ask you a question? You talked
about how all of the women that you were meeting with and talking with
were introduced into prostitution somehow with pornography.]{.font4}

[T. S.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you describe that a little more and
talk about the relationship between the pornography shown and pictures
actually taken of the young women that it was being shown to?]{.font4}

[T. S.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [How it was introduced was that young women
would be picked up on the street, off the street, and everyone's first
experience was always the same, which was that the man would show either
magazines or take you to a movie and then afterwards instruct her to act
in the way that the magazines or the films had depicted. Usually after,
I call it a training period, what would happen then is that these men or
different men would set up scenarios of usually more than one woman to
very, very specifically copy and reproduce scenes that were portrayed in
magazines and books that they had witnessed. And then they would make
their own movies using home video equipment and also Polaroid cameras
and they would all collect their own library of\*pornography involving
these women.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[COUNCILWOMAN BARBARA CARLSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have a question of
Mrs.]{.font4} [\[sic\]]{.font4} [MacKinnon and some of the people that
have talked, and I would like to preface my question by thanking the
people that have shared their stories tonight. I know it was extremely
painful for them, for me, for the women to share their stories.]{.font4}

[The statement is I have gone through somewhat the catharsis that the
women have gone through in my bout with alcoholism. I have shared many
of the same things in the first step, in group treatment, and I have
heard some references to drinking and use of alcohol and I am presuming
the use of drugs in some of these stories.]{.font4}

[And my question of you---and I am not going to be able to stay for the
rest of the testimony, I have a meeting---but my question to you and the
women and men that shared their stories is, how much alcoholism or
alcohol and drugs are relevant in the stories?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you for the question. It is a very,
very good one. The answer is that the abuse of drugs and alcohol is
absolutely systematically present through almost all of these stories.
And that there is a cynical and purposeful use of both drugs and alcohol
by pimps on women, both to produce the material, that is the
pornography, and to keep women in prostitution.]{.font4}

[CARLSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My question to you though is one of, could it
be the use of chemicals, drugs, or alcohol that has caused some of these
problems, rather than pornography?]{.font4}

[T. S.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I know about that is, there is a group of
Christian men who actually use pornography and prostitutes in this town,
and they are totally against the use of alcohol, and they manage to do
just fine.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will announce that the next speaker will
be J. B., followed by Shannon McCarthy Bicha.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I would like to also say,
Councilmember Carlson, is that while the use of drugs and of alcohol are
part of the systematic pattern of abuse, it isn't the same thing to say
that those things cause that abuse. In other words, we are making the
argument that pornography motivates it, inspires it, leads people to
believe that it is justified, that it makes it profitable, and that it
also---it basically defines it as something that is okay to do. Once it
is defined as something that is okay to do, it is okay to abuse these
women in these ways, then anything that is abusive to women becomes okay
to do, and drugs and alcohol are those things. Do you see what I am
saying?]{.font4}

[CARLSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I am hearing you say is that the
pornography is the beginning?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All of the stories that you have heard are
representative of a thousand more stories and some of them involve
direct drugging. And we are not talking about people, about women who
are choosing to drink, although in some cases, for instance the
testimony of R. M., drinking was a part of her lifestyle, and it was a
part of being able to endure the abuse. I think it is important to
understand the different situations in which drinking and drugs are
used. But the constant in all of the situations is the
pornography.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Also, the men are not doing what they are
doing to the women because of alcohol and drugs. The data that we had
earlier on today showed a direct causal relationship between pornography
and aggression towards women.]{.font4}

[E. M.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is E. M. I talked earlier. What I want
to say to you is that what I am hearing is a tendency, and I find that
real dangerous, to say that these people were drinking or were on drugs,
and so therefore, we attribute it to that. And that really frightens me
because in my situation, I was in a normal social situation. I had gone
to dinner. No one was drinking. I was on my second glass of wine as were
the other people. Some of them were only on their first. What I know is
that this was something that was planned and there is no way that any
of---that I can attribute any of what happened to me to my being drunk,
or any of these men being drunk, because they weren't.]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am J. B. I live in St. Paul right now. I
used to be a resident of Minneapolis. I am simply going to relate what
happened to me about four years ago on the job. I, for the past six
years, have been in training to be a plumber. And about four years ago I
got stuck on a job that was almost completed but not quite. I don't know
if you understand construction set-ups, but generally in the winter,
certain trades will get together and have a little shack inside of a
building where they will eat lunch and have coffee and everything
else.]{.font4}

[When I got on the job, three of the trades had set up a nice little
shack and had lunch there. And it was a real shock when I walked in,
because three of the four walls in the room were completely decorated
with pictures out of various magazines,]{.font4} [Hustler, Playboy,
Penthouse, Oui,]{.font4} [all of those. Some of them I would have
considered regular pinups, but some of them were very, very explicit,
showing women with their legs spread wide and men and women performing
sex acts and women in bondage. It was very uncomfortable for me to go
down there and have dinner and lunch with about twenty men, and here is
me facing all these pictures and hearing all these men talking about all
the wonderful things they did on the weekend with all of these
women.]{.font4}

[I put up with it for about a week, and it finally got to the point
where I could no longer tolerate sitting there and realizing that all of
these men were there. I felt totally naked in front of these men. The
only thing they talked about during lunch period was women---their old
ladies, their girlfriends, and all their conquests of the
weekend.]{.font4}

[I got to the point where I couldn't put up with it any more. And being
one of the only two women on the job, and being rather new at it and not
knowing that I had any alternatives, I got pissed off one day and ripped
all the pictures off the wall. Well, it turned out to be a real
unpopular move to do. I came back in at lunch time and half the pictures
were back up again. They pulled them out of boxes and stuck them on the
wall and proceeded to call me names, and just basically call me names or
otherwise ignore me.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you recall what names they called
you?]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [There was one electrician that had it in for
me. He always said, "Hey, bitch" or some other term that didn't really
sit with me too well. It was very, very hostile.]{.font4}

[So after lunch, I went back in and took them all down again, and I came
back the next morning and some of them were back up again. At that point
I decided that I no longer wanted to eat with these men, and I began to
eat my lunch at other places in the building and was totally boycotted
at work. The men wouldn't talk to me. I mean I was treated like I had
just done something terrible.]{.font4}

[Just by happenstance on that weekend, I was at a meeting and was
relating my story to some women, and one of them happened to be a woman
who worked for the Affirmative Rights Office in Minneapolis. She said we
can help you out. It was an affirmative action job. It was getting
federal funds. And she organized three other women and herself to make
an unannounced inspection and they did that. And I said, I don't want
them to know that I had anything to do with this because I am scared.
And they came and took note of all the pictures that were up---I hadn't
tampered with them any more. They were all on the walls. They wrote
letters to each of the companies involved.]{.font4}

[And during this time, at some point when I was at work, this one
electrician was extremely angry at me. I have no proof that this man did
this, but I came out of work one day, my car door was bashed in. It
wasn't parked anywhere near where any other car would have hit it. It
was bashed in in a place that wasn't logical to be hit by another car. I
have no proof that this man did it, but I had a sneaky suspicion on
that. He was removed from the job, subsequently.]{.font4}

[After the LEAP offices and state had written letters to send out to
these various employers, my boss, the man who owned the company, called
me up one day and said, "Look, I heard you are having a little trouble
down there. Why don't you just kind of calm down a little bit? Don't
make such a mess. We don't need any trouble down there. Just calm down,
just ignore it. " I said, "Hey, I can't ignore it. I don't have to, I
can't, it is already done. " A couple days later they got the letter and
they were told that this did not comply with the action guidelines. In
the meantime, I had asked for a transfer and my transfer came through,
which was very fortunate but---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What part in your transfer did this
pornography play?]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It came a lot faster, is what happened. They
decided I was making too much trouble and had to get me out of
there.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Was it where you wanted to transfer
to?]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No. I had requested that much earlier and had
been waiting on it. But it was really uncomfortable. I felt no support
from the men, none of the men at all. In fact, I approached my boss one
time and said, "I don't like these things, " and he said, "I can't do
anything about it. These men do what they want to do. " And I said,
"Piss on it, I will do what I want to do."]{.font4}

[It would have been nice if I would have known that there was some
action I could have taken, knowing I didn't want those pictures there,
or not knowing that I could have taken them down, shots of women's
genitals.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you have any idea, just to enlighten it
for all of us, what their stake in it was, why they kept putting it up
over and over?]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I, for a long time and, you know, this might
not be right, but this has been my sense. I mean, I have encountered
pretty much hostility in the last six years being the only woman on the
job doing men's work. On that particular job, I was a legal threat
because I had replaced one of the other men who was causing trouble, who
was one of the good old boys. And I think they were doubly angry at me
on that job and they wanted to get rid of me.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think we will now take a short
recess, be back in 10 minutes.]{.font4}

[(Short recess. )]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We will resume the public hearing.
There is a time certain at 9: 00 o'clock. If there are people who have
added their names since the last time, I don't know who came up and got
this, but they have added their names. So I would like the people to
utilize the three minutes, because the other persons that testified gave
stories of their lives that were rather horrendous, and we gave them a
little more than the time that should have been allotted. But we are
after 8: 00 o'clock now, so we will move right along.]{.font4}

[We have Shannon McCarthy Bicha. Did I say that correctly?]{.font4}

[SHANNON McCARTHY BICHA:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I won't correct you. I prefer
to have it said the way it was. That is fine.]{.font4}

[I am a resident of St. Paul, and I have been throughout the majority of
my life. What I would like to provide you first is a personal history of
where I have been.]{.font4}

[I have lived in St. Paul the majority of my life, excluding five years.
And during those five years---it was more than five years, it was eight
years---during four years of which I went to the University of Minnesota
in Duluth, and the remaining four years I lived in Toronto, Ontario in
Canada. What I learned during those eight years was very difficult. I
was away from St. Paul. I knew my city very well before I went to the
University of Minnesota, Duluth. And when I came back from Canada in
1978, I felt I still knew my city, even though I was away from St.
Paul.]{.font4}

[My husband and me moved close to Dale Street and University, which is
located close to quite a lot of pornography places, the Faust Theater,
the Flick and the other is called the Belmont Club. I remember when I
was a little girl on Sunday we would drive by the Belmont Club. I would
say, what is the Belmont Club, and my father would say, it is nothing
that would interest you, Shannon. And still being a young girl, I didn't
care much if my dad said, you are not concerned.]{.font4}

[What happened, I went to the local high school, I went to St. Agnes
High School, which is located only four blocks from those three
pornography shops. And at that time the Faust Theater and the Flick were
not in operation, so the Belmont was still a pretty silent place, and
everyone who lived in that neighborhood felt rather protected and secure
from being subjected to sexual harassment and violence as a result of
pornography.]{.font4}

[What happened is that my husband and I moved into the residence in
1981, and at that time I was exposed to sexual harassment that I never
knew existed. What I would like to discuss are three of the types of
sexual harassments that I had to face within two years. For myself it
was disgusting, it was very frightening, and I really don't think that I
have any way to work around it, and that's the strongest fear that I
have at this point.]{.font4}

[I would like to speak on behalf of the other people who live in my
residence because we all, to a large degree, feel that we are invisible,
silent people. Our neighborhood is very working class, a lot of the
people don't have 9: 00 to 5: 00 jobs. They are working in the afternoon
or afternoon shifts. We are the type of people who like to have our
voices heard. We don't have political power. We don't have money. We are
barely making it day to day. When it comes to having people hear us
speak, we don't feel we are heard. The police that are working in our
neighborhood are upset with the Faust and the Flick because a man can
pay a quarter and go and see a quarter show, and all he has to do is pay
two dollars and he can have a female completely nude do all the dancing
for him in three minutes.]{.font4}

[The police have gone to the Flick and tried to bust it time and time
again. Finally the police in our residence have said, forget it, we are
giving up, nothing has been done. We are not going in there and taking
the chance of having our heads blown off. Us, the people that live in
the neighborhood, we have to fear that day in and day out, especially
the women.]{.font4}

[Just last week, I had an exceptionally horrifying situation when my
husband was not home and a man tried to get into my house by both the
front and the back door. He wouldn't leave. He continued to knock. He
was trying to get the door open. And it was so serious in the sense that
the police even tried to get him, but at the same time too, they didn't
make the attempt. What this boils down to is that the police have come
to the end of the rope with my neighborhood. They feel that they can
only do so much and consequently, they are not giving the same
protection and same security which they did for other neighborhoods. I
empathize with them, there are a number of good people that don't live
in our residence but happen to be at the porno shops, and they subject
the police to constant harassment. They subject them to the fear of
physical abuse and, consequently, the police are in a position where
they are stepping back. But the people who are paying the price are
myself and my neighbors.]{.font4}

[What I said before was that within two years I had been subjected to
sexual harassment. It all started in 1981 when I moved---my husband and
I moved in. At that time, I was pregnant, and I was walking just to the
Country Club Store across the street, but I was in the vicinity of the
Belmont Club, the Faust, and the Flick. And a middle-aged man, white, he
had on a business suit, was crossing the street, same as myself. Right
off he asked me if I was a prostitute. We were crossing University
Avenue. I was shocked. I wanted to get away from him as fast as I could,
but at the same time I was seven months pregnant and I couldn't run. The
best I could do is walk and ignore the man. I came home and I was
shaking like a leaf with my husband. He was so disgusted because there
was not a damn thing he could do. He has to hope to hell that his wife
is going to be able to live a somewhat normal life.]{.font4}

[Then it happened again where I was going to Wendy's Hamburger Shop.
Instead of asking me if I was a prostitute, he asked me how much I cost.
You are just in a position when you think, when is this going to stop?
Is it because I live close to these pornography shops that this
continues to happen?]{.font4}

[The third time that it did happen to me, I am very firmly convinced
that it has a very strong significant high correlation with the
pornography. The third time it was another work, another businessman,
but at this time the man was around the age of 50. Rather than ask me if
I was a prostitute or how much I cost, he walked right up to me and
said, "You are the dancer from the Belmont, aren't you? I saw you a
couple nights ago. You really did a good job. " You don't know what to
say. I am in that position where I am so thoroughly frightened, I am
shaking in my shoes. At the same time, I am so disgusted, I would like
to be able to tell him how I feel. I can't do that, especially living so
close. My fear is that this man is going to be very disgusted with my
comment and he can follow me right home.]{.font4}

[I have a daughter who is two years old, and there are many mothers,
many parents who live in my neighborhood. The average number of children
per block on my block is at least fifteen kids, and those I am referring
to are infants all the way through eighteen-year-old children. And we
all have to face that constant fear. What is it going to be like when my
daughter is old enough that she can walk and go to the stores? How often
can I tell her, don't go there, that is a bad place for you to go? All
the parents feel that way but at the same time we feel powerless. We
don't feel that we have the voice, and we don't feel that people will
listen to us because we are working class. It is a very sad
situation.]{.font4}

[The last thing that happened to me puts me in a position. I have
epilepsy. I have a physical disability whereby I am partially conscious
during the seizures. As a result of that, I can look very quote unquote
normal in the sense that I hear a person to a certain extent, but I
can't comprehend what the person is saying to me. I can see things but
that doesn't mean I am going to be able to do the correct thing, in the
sense of seeing a green light and walking with a green light. I might
see the light but go ahead and walk, even if it is yellow or
red.]{.font4}

[The last time it happened, I was in the bus shelter, it was raining,
and I decided I was going to take my chance and sit there rather than
being wet and going to work. As a result of that, two men saw me, this
is---everything occurred during the daylight, nothing has happened at
night, which is more difficult to deal with. In the evening I can't even
walk out of my house, with this happening during the day. A man came on
one side of the bus shelter and a man on the other side. I was inside.
They came into the shelter at the same time and talked to me as if they
had known me. I didn't know who the men were. And automatically I have
that fear---I was in front of the Belmont Club---that these men are
going to interpret me as being a prostitute or a dancer, and it boiled
down to them asking me if I was a prostitute. With it happening three
times before and one more time, I just got to the point where I was
going to try my chance and shock these men as best as I could, and I
played as if I was mentally retarded. It was a sad case to go through.
They both saw me as being the person I am now.]{.font4}

[I totally ignored them. I didn't respond to anything they were saying.
They continued talking and finally one of the men said, "Do you happen
to know what the time is? " It's just crazy, the only thing I could do
was to say, "Well, I really don't have a watch on now but I think it is
about 11: 00. " (Using slurred speech. ) It frightened the men. It put
goose bumps on me because I think this is what I have to do in my own
neighborhood to protect myself. And these men walked away from me. They
didn't want any contact with me at all, because I played the role of a
woman who was mentally retarded.]{.font4}

[It is a sad case when the police have approached my neighbors and
myself and they said, "The best recourse you have and your husband have
and your children is to get up and move. " Why should I have to move
from my neighborhood when this is all I can afford? This is the very
best type of structure that my husband and I ever are going to gain. At
the same time, the police are at the point where they are ready to give
up. At the same time, they are explaining to us, "We really empathize
for you, but get up and get out, that is your best result, that is your
best recourse. " And that is why I wanted to come tonight, because I
know the concept of pornography is associated with the First Amendment
in regards to freedom of speech. In my life nothing compares to the
freedom of equality, the freedom of not feeling fear and being sexually
harassed, the possibility of being sexually raped, the possibility of
sexual abuse in another form of rape. I would give my freedom of speech
up in two seconds flat if I knew myself as well as my daughter as well
as my husband and all of my neighbors didn't have to face the garbage
that results from the Faust, the Flick, and the Belmont Club.]{.font4}

[That is why I hope everyone that is here tonight will take a strong
look at this. I have invited many people who have supported pornography
to come to my neighborhood and live there for a week, and I will walk
you all past the Belmont Club, Faust, and Flick. I will give you a tour.
You can see what it is like. You can bring your children and bring your
wife and anybody else who supports pornography. You move into my
neighborhood and I will move into yours. It chokes me up, because you
have the power, I don't.]{.font4}

[I have worked with cases of women who have been sexually harassed. I
have worked with young mothers who are single as a result of rape. They
have children physically handicapped because of it. The children are
going to have to grow up facing the result that they are a by-product of
rape. These young women who were exposed to pornography from day one,
they are accustomed with all the pornography magazines.]{.font4}
[Hustler]{.font4} [is nothing to them. The]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}
[is like]{.font4} [Time]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Newsweek,]{.font4} [they
are so adjusted to this psychologically because it's been rammed down
their throats. They have had no alternatives.]{.font4}

[And all of you have a very strong say in what can happen in Minneapolis
as well as St. Paul, and I really hope you do something about it. It has
got to stop. There has got to be a time where a woman as. well as a
father can have the opportunity to say, hey, we live in America. We have
the opportunity to be treated just as equal as everyone else, unaware of
money, and unaware of status and accreditation. Everyone should be
treated equal. I would like to end there. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you for coming from our sister
city. It just goes to show it is not just on one block or one
street.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I believe that Steve Jevning is going to
speak for the neighborhood group.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, Councilman Dziedzic?]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I was disappointed to hear that the police
told someone in the neighborhood to move. That is really a poor
indication on whether or not the police can control a situation in a
neighborhood. I am sorry to hear that goes on in St. Paul. I think we
could put a stop to that kind of rhetoric in Minneapolis.]{.font4}

[Whenever you hear that, the way to answer is to tell the police
officers that their hands aren't tied, and they have every right to
enforce the laws to make that a safer neighborhood. If they don't, their
boss should come and see the Council and there should be steps taken. I
am not talking about just this issue. When a police officer tells you
that, he is saying he can't do his job, is what he is saying.]{.font4}

[STEVE JEVNING:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Dziedzic, Mr. Chairman, Members of
the Committee, my name is Steve Jevning. I represent the Neighborhood
Pornography Task Force. The Task Force is really the most recent
organized group of a number of concerned citizens in South Central
Minneapolis who have rallied around the issue of fighting pornography
for a number of years. The Task Force members are for the most part made
up of residents of the Powderhorn Park and several neighborhoods of
Central Minneapolis who happen to have a number of adult entertainment
establishments within their city-designated boundaries.]{.font4}

[I would like to start my comments tonight, and I will indeed keep them
brief, by telling all of you that I feel privileged as a white,
Anglo-Saxon Protestant male to exercise my First Amendment right to
speak in favor of the proposed civil rights amendment that would
guarantee Fourteenth Amendment rights for all members of this community,
particularly women who are underrepresented at the least, and abused,
raped, and killed at the worst. I have spoken before this Council
Committee and other committees of the City Council about the need for
the City of]{.font4}

[Minneapolis to take steps that would indicate not only to the women,
the men, and the children of this community how important they are in
the eyes of political leaders, community leaders, but also to take a
step that would indicate to this society as a whole that in at least one
tiny city, village, whatever, there are people, men and women elected to
represent their constituents who are committed to support the rights of
everyone. To exist day to day in this society with reduced levels of
anxiety, fear, so that they too can feel as comfortable and as
privileged as I do as a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male, to do the
things that they should all be able to do---to live a peaceful life, to
live an important life, and to contribute in ways that make this society
a better place to live for this generation, for the people who are here
today, for the people who are yet unborn, so that one day people can
look back upon the actions that this Council will hopefully take, and
say that here was a group of people who identified an overlooked
problem, an overlooked ill of society. But they realized the
significance of that tiny overlooked problem as being extremely
representative of the overriding inequities that exist, continue to
exist, and in fact, flourish today.]{.font4}

[Pornography is a very graphic representation of the sexual inequalities
and the conflicts between power and powerlessness that exist in this
city and this state and in this country. And I urge you to put aside
some of the questions which you are finding difficult to answer and take
a bold step and allow the answers to be formulated by those people who
are not as courageous as you have been. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The Chair would like to say this to
you, Steve. It does my heart good to hear a younger person talking about
the camaraderie amongst people, whether he is white, Anglo-Saxon,
Protestant or if he is Afro-American or whatever, but as a human being,
because this did exist here in this city, and there are those of you
that know that, and people did not lock their doors, women were not
afraid to walk the streets, the crime that we have in our communities
that transcends all of the things that we talked about here today did
not exist here in this city as rapidly as it is today. And hopefully,
what you are saying, that with the help of all others, we can buy us a
society back as much as possible, reach into the past and bring forth
that which is good and make it applicable, and do it again in our
society today and in the future.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White, might I be able to be
permitted to\' read a letter which is written by Women Against
Pornography, which is the foremost group working against pornography in
this country. I think it will give a national perspective to everything
that was stated here locally. I would appreciate the permission for me
to read this letter. I think it will take two minutes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Two minutes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, I am not going to try to read a
whole letter--- \[Exh. 8\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Wait a minute, no. Some of the Council
members are going to have to go, and if you can submit that letter,
these people have got their names here and it is getting close to 9: 00
o'clock. We will try and get as many of you as we can. If we don't reach
you at 9: 00 o'clock, then hopefully you can come back tomorrow at 5:
00. Please do that.]{.font4} [DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, I
am sorry I couldn't attend the whole meeting this afternoon. We had an
intergovernmental meeting and we had a press conference on the "I" Team.
Right now at the Government Center across the street there is a hearing
going on with problems in northeast Minneapolis. I will have to excuse
myself and go over there. There are three events planned tomorrow
evening, and all of those events start at 5: 00 o'clock. I will come
tomorrow and stay as long as I can. I would like to know the intention
on what the time frame is on the vote from you.]{.font4} [CHAIRMAN
WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The intent of the time frame?]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Hopefully, at the end of the public
hearing tomorrow we can take a vote.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I was wondering about the objection from the
Civil Rights Commission that we table this to look at the
ordinance.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We will have had their letter by Friday, so if
it goes the other way, that can be taken into consideration.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will repeat my intent to not have it go to
Council on Friday, that the Civil Rights Commission be given the
opportunity to look at it, repair any damage that was done with them as
far as this body not going through the proper channels. I have heard a
lot of testimony today. I have been sensitized by what I have heard. I
can recall issues in the past, I have heard issues in the past, and
recall becoming sensitized with the events as they occurred. With color
breaking into baseball in 1948, having witnessed different singular
schools become coeducational, one of them being the college that I
attended. And I remember a letter that I received from that college that
was asking for input from alumni. And I wrote back. With a wife and
three daughters, you figure out how I would have voted, or what my input
would be as it relates to changing St. Thomas College to a coeducational
college.]{.font4}

[I think the main thrust of the ordinance---I think we are going to have
some difficulty, as Alderman Rockenstein said today. This is probably
the first day of a ten-year battle, like our fight for civil rights is
still going on. I think that the basis of what we are trying to do is
have some input. I don't think you are talking about just pornography. I
think you are talking about the whole printed media and some of them
which have been legitimized,]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [and some of
those magazines, have some of the best ratings. I think that when
you---please don't be a high school audience.]{.font4}

[UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Don't be a high school speaker.
Are you testifying, sir? Is he testifying? You are wasting
time.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It is all right. He is on the
Committee.]{.font4}

[DZIEDZIC:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think the whole motion picture industry
will have some sort of a fight of what we are trying to do here. I think
all of those things should be taken into consideration. That is why I
think we shouldn't vote on Friday.]{.font4}

[There have been nasty people out there today. I will tell you right to
your face.]{.font4}

[UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It takes one to know
one.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you go ahead.]{.font4}

[M. M. D.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is M. M. D. I live in the 6th Ward.
I am not going to speak about the ordinance. I am going to speak about
my life also.]{.font4}

[I was at the demonstration on Lake Street and Chicago Avenue a week and
a half ago along with a number of other women who went into the porn
shop and movie theater there. I looked, glancing really, at the images
on the shelves and on the screen and, even in the midst of the large and
angry powerful group of women, I was afraid. Two days later, having
failed my attempts to keep those images away from me---]{.font4}

[I was sexually abused in my family. I don't know if the man that abused
me uses pornography, but looking at the women in those pictures, I saw
myself at fourteen, at fifteen, at sixteen. I felt the weight of that
man's body, the pain, the disgust.]{.font4}

[I am angered now and horrified. You see so clearly that I was used as
if I was a disposable image. I am also angered and horrified to find
that such limited exposure to pornography called up the memories and the
behavior patterns of my victimization so profoundly. I don't need
studies and statistics to tell me that there is a relationship between
pornography and real violence against women. My body remembers.]{.font4}

[JAMES H. KOPLIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Jim Koplin. I live at
\[address deleted\]. I will speak of the ordinance under discussion as
an individual, not representing any organization. I am not a lawyer, but
I have been bothered by discussions of pornography as a First Amendment
issue. The move to change the base of the civil rights area strikes me
as an important tactic. My remarks aren't legalistic, they are general
issues.]{.font4}

[I am a gay man. I want to talk mainly to my gay brothers. We can easily
find ourselves in ambivalent positions in where the distribution of
pornography is. For some gay communities, adult bookstores are main
outlets for pornography material. They are---in fact, they serve as a
meeting place and as a place to be sexual together. In a society of
loving someone and being sexual with someone of the same sex, this can
have severe negative consequences. Gay men have had to develop signals
in order to recognize each other and cultivate places where we can feel
relatively safe. Adult bookstores have come to be part of that picture.
So I do not take lightly that such places will be lost to the gay
community when the stores of pornography, this porn ordinance of
pornography comes to be successful.]{.font4}

[I would ask gay men to accept the teachership of women, to listen
carefully to the points raised by women during these hearings. I have
tried to do that here and on other contacts, and my personal conclusion
is that gay men should accept the inconvenience of the world without
adult bookstores in order to promote the survival of women which is very
much threatened by any situation that promotes pornography. And that is
my main point.]{.font4}

[I want to add something, looking toward the long range. Ordinances like
this are important, but in my judgment, pornography will only truly
disappear from a society when all people are able to express their
sexuality freely and openly, or when the space now occupied by
pornography is empty or perhaps better than that, be filled with
eroticization of positive values, like justice and respect. We are so
far from that now that it is almost impossible to even imagine what this
might be like.]{.font4}

[I do have flashes of this vision now and again. I suspect all of you
have such moments as well. My intuition tells me that gay men and
progressive women are allies in elaborating this vision. I don't mean to
exclude anyone but both of these groups are defined by outside values.
Frequently these visions come from outsiders.]{.font4}

[So my hope is that we can work together in the short term and in the
long term, rather than end up in whatever positions, divided positions.
That is my hope. We are a long way from realizing that. I am committed
to realizing that hope. \[These are the\] kinds of thoughts that let me
come here to ask our Council members to vote in favor of the ordinance.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [C. B.]{.font4}

[MS. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am C. B. \[spelling name deleted\]. I am the
outreach advocate for a group called PRIDE.^10 ^PRIDE is a self-help
group for women who are or have been involved in the behavior of
prostitution. PRIDE is sponsored by the Minneapolis Family and
Children's Services. As the outreach advocate, I would like to support
the amending of the civil rights ordinance and turn your attention to
Section 5 number 2 specifically.]{.font4}

[I was involved in the behavior of prostitution for a period of three
years. Since then, I have been involved with the PRIDE group for a year
and a half. In my own experience, and in working with women, I have
become aware of the prevailing attitude that women who have been
involved in prostitution are somehow exempt from coercion. Therefore, I
would like to emphasize the importance of the inclusion of Section 5,
number 2, letters aa through mm, as a part of this
ordinance.^11^]{.font4}

[The same societal attitudes which support pornography also support
prostitution. By allowing pornography to continue, our society is
condoning and supporting the degradation of all women. Thank
you.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The next speaker.]{.font4}

[NAOMI SCHEMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Naomi Scheman,
S-c-h-e-m-a-n. I live in Ward 6. I am an Associate Professor of
Philosophy and Director of Undergraduate Studies in Women's Studies at
the University of Minnesota. I teach "Feminist Criticism of Concepts of
the Self. " I have taught it two or three times a year. This is my fifth
year.]{.font4}

[It is very clear to me in teaching that course what the connection is
between pornography and freedom of speech, because over and over and
over again in that class I have the students in that class discuss with
me the experience that we have all had here this evening. That is, women
finding their voices, finding the ability to speak---often for the first
time---and identifying what it is in their lives, what the forces are in
the society that have kept them silent for so long, that have forcibly
kept them silent, that have chased any possible words out of their
heads, that have given no ground to stand on and no voice to speak with.
They speak within that class, and within that class we learn how to
speak the truth to each other. We learn how to hear it, learn how to
articulate it, learn how to be clear about it.]{.font4}

[The question is: what do we do when we go out of that class? What do we
do when we go out of that class into that world that tells us that we
are imagining it, we are making it up, that they are not like that, that
these things did not happen to us, or if they did there is nothing so
terribly wrong. That is, we go back to the world that is structured by
pornography and we lose our voices.]{.font4}

[I believed every time I taught that class, there is a problem with what
to say to those women, what to suggest. With the anger they feel, they
often turn into depression. They often retreat back into silence. They
express the anger to those who are closest to them. Sometimes they
deserve it and sometimes they don't. But there has been, as of yet, no
way of moving into the public world, moving into the society, moving
into the world as structured and defined by the law---which matters
because, in our society's terms, it tells us what is most real, what is
most taken seriously, what most matters. There has been no way of moving
back into that world and speaking the truth and expecting to be heard,
of having that anger, of carrying one's voice outside of that classroom,
outside of small groups and friends into the world and having it taken
seriously.]{.font4}

[It has been different teaching that class this quarter. I have been
able to say: they are listening. There is an ordinance here, there is
something that could become part of the law of the city in which we
live, that will enable us to speak the truth, that will enable us to be
empowered. That will not empower the City of Minneapolis, that will not
empower the police of]{.font4}

[Minneapolis, that will empower women to speak the truth and know that
there is a space in this society---not just in isolated classrooms or
friendship groups or support groups---for that truth to be heard, taken
seriously, believed, and acted on. And it has been a different
experience in teaching that course. I have been able to say to them, it
is not your own private anger any more. It is being listened to, taken
seriously.]{.font4}

[I am going to teach that course again in the summer. I don't want to
have to go into that class saying, well, they listened for a while. When
it came to having the courage to provide the space for women, to listen,
when it finally came to that they didn't come through, and there still
is no room in this society for your voice to be heard. I don't want to
have to do that.]{.font4}

[CARRIE RICKARD:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is R-i-c-k-a-r-d. I am on the
staff of Women's Health Care Associates, a private clinic in south
Minneapolis. Our services include those of an obstetrics gynecologist,
certified nurse, midwives, and nurse practitioner. Many of the women
that come to our clinic have been sexually abused.]{.font4}

[Dr. Patsy Parker, obstetrician and gynecologist in our office,
estimates that over 50 percent, over 100 of the women that she sees,
have told her of past or of continuing sexual abuse. The emotional pain
caused by the sexual abuse of these and of all women makes any promotion
of that abuse intolerable and a violation in and of itself. Pornography
and the legality of pornography suggests that the violent subjugation of
women is okay. For that reason, everybody at Women's Health Care
Associates supports this Chair's amendment to ratify this
ordinance.]{.font4}

then has the public hearing. The Committee then takes an action and that
action, is either to vote it forward at the meeting or postpone it and
go at a later meeting to collect more data, or to send it forward with a
recommendation for denial. That action is then forwarded to the
Minneapolis City Council. They can agree with what the Committee has
said, they can reverse what the Committee has said, or they can hold it
on the Council floor in search of further action. Once they take an
action on to the Minneapolis City Council, it is then referred to the
Mayor of the City of Minneapolis, who has five working days in which to
make a decision of whether to sign it, let it pass without signature, or
to veto it. If it is vetoed, it comes back to the Minneapolis City
Council for a decision of whether or not to override.]{.font4}

told me she had sent a letter in strong support, and she is going to get
other support from other actresses and other people who live in
Hollywood, to send telegrams and mail to me as Chairman of the
Government Operations. And the letter I have before me, since Professor
MacKinnon has amazed me ever since I heard her in Zoning and Planning, I
would like you to read this letter from Valerie Harper.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, may I put into evidence, I
won't read it, it is a letter. "To whom it may concern" by Jaime Lyn
Bauer, who talks about her own exploitation by pornography. \[Exh.
9\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, just put it into the record. But
I am also aware that Valerie Harper sent you the T-shirt, but we won't
show that.]{.font4}

[Now, to reiterate my discretion, I would like to limit the speakers to
three minutes. I am going to allow Bill Neiman of the Hennepin County
Attorney's Office to speak because of his having to get out of here for
some reason he didn't explain to me. But I am certain that it is
important. Bill Neiman, would you come and speak briefly?]{.font4}

[BILL NEIMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Bill Neiman, Assistant County
Attorney in the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. And I appreciate
being taken out of order. The reason is, I have to get back home to take
care of my children.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, I didn't know that.]{.font4}

[NEIMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The reason I was asked by Councilmember Hoyt
to speak today regarding the subject is because I have been in the
Hennepin County Attorney's Office for five years and on the team of
attorneys who prosecute all sexual assault cases and child abuse cases
at Hennepin County.]{.font4}

[In brief, the background, our office did support and did draft the bill
which was passed a year ago that makes virtually all forms of child
pornography a felony. Now, in terms of the relationship between
pornography and sexual assault and child abuse, what I am best equipped
to talk to you about is what I have seen as prosecutor, having reviewed
hundreds, certainly a hundred or more cases involving sexual assault of
adults or the sexual abuse of children.]{.font4}

[Now, I should emphasize, and this is important to understand, that
generally speaking with pornography, materials are seized or found at
the time of the arrest or shortly after the arrest. It is not with a
purpose. That is, the police are not looking for those materials, so
that when I talk about the numbers I am about to speak of, I say that
with the understanding that I have little doubt that if the police, in
each case where they suspected sexual assault, looked for material of
this type, if they did, they would find a much greater number than are
found. I say that because quite a number are found without any special
effort being made to look for pornographic materials.]{.font4}

[Now, in cases involving adults, primarily women---that is women, female
victims---pornographic materials are often found. I would not say in a
majority of cases, but a substantial percent of cases, those materials
are found in or near where the person lives or, say, the motor vehicle
which was used to transport the assailant to the place of the sexual
assault.]{.font4}

[We do see, with children, a much greater use in pornographic materials.
I would say that in the cases that I had---that I have had, and I have
had many of them---that pornographic materials are found, if not in a
majority of cases, very close to the majority of cases, found in the
home of the person who is sexually abusing the children, and often there
are very substantial numbers of pornographic materials. These
pornographic materials are both adult and children.]{.font4}

[Now, an example, and I could give you many examples, an example of a
recent case I had---or I have, actually---where such materials were
being used. Just for the Committee's information, this young girl was
raped, I believe, by her stepfather, a live-in boyfriend. And one of the
things that he did as part of the sexual assault of the girl is, he
would sit on the toilet undressed, and she would be undressed in the
bathroom, and he would have her, while undressed, hold up, for example,
the centerfold of a magazine that depicted a naked woman or whatever.
And while she was holding this and standing naked herself, he would
masturbate himself. And this use is not extraordinary. It is no more
bizarre or less bizarre a use of pornographic material]{.font4}
[than]{.font4} [we have seen. So I think it is fair to say, from the
point of view of the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, that we have
found pornography to be used very substantially where children are the
victims and substantially where adults are the victims. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [May I ask you one question?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I wanted to ask one too.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am sorry. Please.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Under Section One, 139. 10 in the
ending sentence of that paragraph it reads, "Such discriminatory
practices degrade individuals, foster intolerance and hate, and create
and intensify unemployment, substandard housing, under-education, ill
health, lawlessness and poverty, thereby injuring the public welfare. "
As an attorney dealing with all of those things, what does that sentence
say to you?]{.font4}

[NEIMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In terms of pornography, well, my personal
belief is that pornography does cause people to act out criminally,
sexually, criminally in a sexual fashion, sometimes in a physical
aggressive fashion. My personal belief is that there is a relationship.
I don't have scientific evidence of that, but I have simply seen too
many cases to believe otherwise. That is how I would read that sentence
and it is hard---as stated, it is hard to ]{.font4}[describe something
which has that terrible impact as anything other than discriminatory,
when the impact it has on the victims is as great as it is.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you say it is against the public
welfare?]{.font4}

[NEIMAN: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [would say that given what happens to the
victims in these cases, especially the child victims that are most
often, if not destroyed, partially ruined for life, that if it had that
effect on one victim, it would have a terrible effect. I think it has
that effect on hundreds of children.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7
.sgc-1} [Have you found the taking of pictures to be part of these
things you see?]{.font4}

[NEIMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We have seen---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In the course of your work?]{.font4}

[NEIMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I have. And others in the office have
prosecuted these cases. Frankly, I think there is much more of it than
we have had the good fortune to discover. And in fact, our office is
presently trying to develop a somewhat more sophisticated approach to
locating, arresting, and prosecuting pornographers. The persons that we
have found, we have prosecuted, and I believe they have been involved
sexually with the children. My personal belief is that, although we have
had some success, there is much more out there that we haven't been able
to locate or find, as \[it is\] a sophisticated offense and it is
difficult to get to the perpetrator. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[The next speaker, and please, we would like to get out of here. I know
how you feel, but we don't have the time that I would like to have here
this evening. So if you would hold your statements to four minutes, as
closely as possible to it, I would appreciate it. The next speaker would
be Wanda Richardson.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [S. G., I believe would be first if she is
here. And then Carole laFavor and then Carol Ann.]{.font4}

[MS. G.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Before I begin, I have to say that I am unable
to state what my relationship is to the people I am going to talk about,
because many of them are still victims whose lives are in
danger.]{.font4}

[For the majority of my life, I lived with a divorced woman and her
children in the house that she owned. Her ex-husband also lived in the
house we lived in. He would not leave. He threatened to kill the woman
if she ever tried to get help in getting him away from her and out of
her house.]{.font4}

[Over a period of eighteen years, the woman was regularly raped by this
man. He would bring pornographic magazines, books, and paraphernalia
into the bedroom with him and tell her that if she did not perform the
sexual acts that were being done in the "dirty" books and magazines, he
would beat and kill her. I know about this because my bedroom was right
next to hers. I could hear everything they said. I could hear her
screams and cries. In addition, since I did most of the cleaning in the
house, I would often come across the books, magazines, and paraphernalia
that were in the bedroom and other rooms of the house. The magazines had
pictures of mostly women and children and some men. Eventually, the
woman admitted to me that her ex-husband did in fact use pornographic
materials to terrorize and rape her.]{.font4}

[Not only did I suffer through the torture of listening to the rapes and
tortures of a woman, but I could see what grotesque acts this man was
performing on her from the pictures in the pornographic materials. I was
also able to see the systematic destruction of a human being taking
place before my eyes.]{.font4}

[At the time I lived with the woman, I was completely helpless,
powerless in regard to helping this woman and her children in getting
away from this man. I was told by the man that if I ever told anyone
about the things that he did, or if I ever tried to run away, that he
would beat me, that he would break and cut off my arms and legs, that he
would cut up my face so that no man would ever want to look at me, that
he would kill me, and that he would make me sorry that I ever told on
him. During the time that I was held captive by that man, I was
physically and psychologically abused by him. I was whipped with belts
and electrical cords. I was beat with pieces of wood. I was usually
forced to pull my pants down before I was to be beaten. I was touched
and grabbed where I did not want him to touch me. I was also locked into
dark closets and the basement for many hours at a time. And I was often
not allowed to speak or cry.]{.font4}

[The things that this man did to me were also done to the children of
the woman, except that they suffered from even worse abuse. I believe
that part of the psychological abuse I suffered from was from the
pornographic materials that the man used in his terrorization of us. I
knew that if he wanted to, he could do more of the things that were
being done in those magazines to me. When he looked at the magazines, he
would make hateful, obscene, violent remarks about women in general and
about me. I was told that because I am female, I am here to be used and
abused by him and that because he is male, he is the master and I am his
slave. I was terrorized into keeping silent, and it wasn't until three
years after escaping from him that I was psychologically and emotionally
strong enough to tell anyone what had happened to me.]{.font4}

[I am not saying that pornography caused that man to do those things to
me and to other women and children. I am saying that pornography is an
extension of the violence and hatred against women that already exists
in this society. To get rid of pornography is to get rid of part of the
violence against women that permeates this society. Pornography makes a
mockery of the torture, beatings, rapes, mutilations, degradations and
killings that I and other women have suffered from---all for men's
sexual gratification.]{.font4}

[Every time I walk into a neighborhood grocery store or drug store I am
reminded that if I don't watch my step, do what I'm told, keep silent or
stay in my place, that I could end up like one of the \'women in that
pornographic material being sold in those stores.]{.font4}

[I believe what those magazines say because it has happened to
me.]{.font4}

[The last statement that I have to make is a political one. If someone
wants to study the condition of women in this society, all that person
has to do is to view a pornographic book, magazine, or movie.
Pornography is an example of a picture, of a diagram with instructions
of how to degrade a woman. It is a blueprint of the state of women's
conditions in the society. Pornography tells the truth about women's
conditions. But pornography lies about how we think and feel about our
condition.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White, a woman named A. W. got in
touch with me this morning, and I would like to submit her written
statement. Perhaps it would be better if I didn't read it and put it in.
It is a statement with detail, and just like the statement that was just
made. \[Exh. 10\]]{.font4} [CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [As I said
last night, it takes quite a bit to sit and stand, as last night, before
all the eyes and ears that are looking and let forth, and let it all
hang out, and tell what happened to someone. It is something I will
never forget.]{.font4}

[Carole laFavor, please?]{.font4}

[CAROLE LAFAVOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [First I want to thank my friends for
coming to support me today. It's scary to stand before you and talk of
something so painful. It helps me having women on the Council. It makes
it a little easier. I wish more of you were people of color.]{.font4}

[I would like to direct my story, even though he is not here, to Mark
Kaplan,^12 ^because I am from his ward. He represents many women of
color, and by his vote on this ordinance he can give us a safer
community in which to live.]{.font4}

[When I was first asked to testify, I resisted some, because the
memories are so painful and so recent. I am here because of my
four-year-old daughter and other Indian children. I want them to grow up
in a more healthful and loving society.]{.font4}

[I was attacked by two white men, and from the beginning they let me
know they hated my people, even though it was obvious from their remarks
they knew very little about us. And they let me know that the rape of a
"squaw" by white men was practically honored by white society. In fact,
it has been made into a video game called "Custer's Last Stand. " And
that's what they screamed in my face as they threw me to the ground,
"This is more fun than Custer's Last Stand. " They held me down and as
one was running the tip of his knife across my face and throat he said,
"Do you want to play Custer's Last Stand? It's great. You lose, but you
don't care, do you? You like a little pain, don't you, squaw? " They
both laughed and then he said, "There is a lot of cock in Custer's Last
Stand. You should be grateful, squaw, that all-American boys like us
want you. Maybe we will tie you to a tree and start a fire around you. "
They made other comments---"the only good Indian is a dead Indian, " "a
squaw out alone deserves to be raped"---words that still terrorize me
today.]{.font4}

[It may surprise you to hear stories that connect pornography and white
men raping women of color. It doesn't surprise me. I think pornography,
racism, and rape are perfect partners. They all rely on hate. They all
reduce a living person to an object. A society that sells books, movies,
and video games like "Custer's Last Stand" on its street corners gives
white men permission to do what they did to me. Like they said, I'm
scum. It is a game to track me down, rape, and torture me.]{.font4}

[So I bring my screams of that night here to you today, hoping that they
will help you decide to stand against the dehumanization and violence of
pornography. I would like to end with a poem that I wrote about my
nightmares after my attack.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, just for the record, I just
want to say that the actual name of the video game which portrays the
rape that was described here, and that was actually lived through, is
"Custer's Revenge. "]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Cheryl Champion, are you
here?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, she is coming in a car. She
is trying to get a ride. She may be a little bit late. We should just
proceed.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Then Wanda Richardson.]{.font4}

[WANDA RICHARDSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I work at Harriet Tubman Women's
Shelter. I was asked to speak about the connection that we see at the
shelter between pornography and violence against women. What I would
like to say is not \[only\] my own thoughts and experience, it is also
that of many other women both working at the shelter and women who have
come to the shelter.]{.font4}

[The first thing that I would like to say is that there is a very
similar status between women who are battered and women in pornography.
Battered women are reduced to being physical objects. They are no longer
people, they have no rights, they have no dignity. They are just objects
and things. Women in pornography are also reduced to the level of
objects and things. They don't exist as human beings but they are merely
there to satisfy a man's desire.]{.font4}

[In the case of battering, we see women existing as something men have
there to vent their feelings on. In pornography, they are there
supposedly for sexual desire. Pornography is a classic example of the
objectification of women. We see results of that every day at our
shelter.]{.font4}

[I would say that, in many cases, a lot of violence that we see really
has nothing to do with sex or anger or anything else. It really is just
a power relationship where there is a great deal of inequality between
men and women, and men are just using that to their advantage to carry
those things out. There is a lot of sex and violence, both in battering
situations and in pornography. If you look at a lot of pornography, it
shows women being beaten, humiliated, tied up. It shows women tied and
stabbed, poked, prodded and abused by devices, assaulted by several men
or animals, and many ugly and degrading things. When you see a woman
being battered, you see a lot of the same ugliness and violence at the
same time. Not only do they portray women as liking and deserving this
sexual abuse, it shows them as enjoying it, deserving it. And that is
what one of the great myths of battery is, is that women deserve to be
battered and that they enjoy it. If they didn't like it, they wouldn't
stay.]{.font4}

[Men look at women in pornography magazines. They say the same things
about them---they like it, they enjoy it. The women coming to the
shelter say over and over again the men say that to them---you enjoy
this, you deserve it. Men look at pornography and they observe that
message---the women liking and deserving that treatment. They act it out
on specific women, usually their girlfriends and wives, sometimes
anonymous, like a rape on the street. What they are doing are acting out
the messages that women are not human beings, they are objects.]{.font4}

[There is many specific cases that I could cite. I don't want to go into
it now. I would like to say we have many, many examples of women coming
to the shelter who have cases of combined sexual and physical assault
where the violence and the sex is intertwined, but you can't tell the
difference---closely intertwined. They are a target not only for
violence but also seen as sexually appealing. And a lot of times this is
acted out at home where men will beat a woman and find that very
sexually arousing. Many of the women come and say that immediately after
battering, or shortly thereafter, the man wants sex and they said, how
could he want me after he has done this to me, how could he expect me to
not be upset, like nothing has happened. And to them, nothing has
happened. To the woman it has been a degrading experience, and to the
man it has been sexually exciting.]{.font4}

[If you look at any pornographic magazine, you will see the answer to
those questions that the women are asking. We had two recent cases that
I would like to cite, one in which a woman was taken repeatedly by her
boyfriend to the Rialto Theater and made to watch "X" rated movies. And
then he would take her home and force her to act out with him these
movies. Of course, a lot of these movies contain extreme violence. After
one of these episodes, she ended up in the hospital. That is how she
came to our shelter.]{.font4}

[In another case, a woman was imprisoned in the house by her husband. He
had a video cassette recorder and he would bring home pornographic
movies and tie her to a chair and force her to act out what they were
seeing on the screen. Of course, she was eventually severely injured
and, again, came to our shelter. These are just two examples. They are
not by any means unusual ones. These things happen all the
time.]{.font4}

[The effects on the women of this kind of abuse---of course, there is
the physical abuse which we see and deal with every day. But there is a
tremendous amount of emotional abuse, mental abuse, that is, they are
degraded and humiliated by the pornography and the violence. There is a
tremendous loss of self-esteem and self-worth. A lot of times that is
what they feel like: that is all they are worth. They are only bodies
and they don't deserve anything better than that treatment. They Have no
rights or respect either from others or from themselves.]{.font4}

[I would also like to point out that a lot of this information that we
have gotten from women of the shelter has not been looked for. We don't
have specific questions on our intakes about sexual abuse and violence.
Most of this comes out during the discussion that we have when the woman
first comes. And as we have seen it over and over again, the women
saying the same things, where you have many separate incidents itself,
but a lot of similar occurrences. You start seeing a pattern, and you
start saying, where is this pattern coming from?]{.font4}

[Well, it is coming from socialization from cultural images. And the
strongest influence that we have been able to find on this type of
treatment of women is pornography. Many of the women said that
pornography is around their house. They say, he has been to the
theaters, he does this and he does that and he sees these things. He
comes home and he acts it out on me, or he makes me act it out also. We
think that pornography is probably the most extreme example of
anti-women socialization that men receive in this society. We don't
believe that men are born to be sexually and physically abusive to
women. They learn this. And the main place they learn this is through
pornography. We see the victims of this every day.]{.font4}

[I would like to finish up by saying that because we have seen so much
of this and it does seem to be increasing, that we are going to be
adding questions on our intake to try and document the connection
between pornography and violence. We are going to try to be collecting
some data, hopefully, that will be helpful for proceedings such as this.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. I can understand, but
please try to hold it to four minutes. We have got so many people. Four

[I would like to say, from working in two shelters and working with the
Coalition for a total of eleven years, that Wanda said for all of us, I
think, a lot of things that I won't repeat. But I think I can add to
them.]{.font4}

[One thing that battered women and women of---victims of
pornography---have in common is an irony. Battered women and women that
are victims of pornography are invisible in this culture. This ordinance
is the beginning of defining their visibility, and it is extremely
important that it pass, and it does not go nearly far enough. Battered
women, until about ten years ago, were invisible. They were told to turn
the other cheek. They went through the revolving door of emergency
rooms. Nobody wanted to help them, and that is the classic way of
creating a victimless crime. You don't even have a victim. She is so
invisible she doesn't exist. When a woman is blamed for the assault that
is done to her, she does not exist. She is invisible in the society.
That is something that has begun to change. It hasn't changed nearly
enough. Women do have options. If a woman is invisible as a victim of a
crime, she has nowhere to go. She literally has no options. This
ordinance is the beginning of options, and it is small.]{.font4}

[Another thing that women have in common---those who are battered and
victims of pornography---they are part of an epidemic. That is an irony
of their visibility. They are not victims of social psychopathic
deviants. There is an epidemic of\... battering of women. Battery
happens in the home. It is private. Battering is sanctified pornography.
Battering happens behind the lace curtain of the sacred home, and it is
a form of pornography and an act of pornography.]{.font4}

[There are 40,000 women in Minnesota who are estimated by the Department
of Corrections to be 40, 000 incidents of battering of women per year,
which is an underestimation. And ten years ago, there were none. It
wasn't even a category of crime. The FBI has called battering the
nation's most underreported crime. It estimates, which is an
underestimate, that a woman is beaten every eighteen seconds. What we
know about the epidemic of pornography is that it is a
seven-billion-dollar industry in this country. The entire national,
federal, AFDC budget is ]{.font4}[eight billion dollars. Pornography is
one billion below that. Both involve women who are hurt in every way.
They are hurt psychologically, they are hurt physically, and they are
hurt sexually. And the combination of what it does to a woman is that,
as women have said who talk to shelter residents, that they don't even
define it as rape. If you ask a woman has she been raped, in an intake,
she says no. If you ask her if sex is forced on her, she says yeah, of
course it has. I mean, that is where we are. We don't even have a
definition of what has happened to women.]{.sgc-3}

[I would like to urge you to pass the ordinance, and I thank you for
holding this testimony. You realize what you have done. You have opened
this floodgate of women. \[You\] have been here to listen to them. And
every woman has a story to tell.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You most certainly are correct. The
floodgates are open. You should see my desk. Barbara Chester?]{.font4}

[BARBARA CHESTER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am here to speak for some of those
women that have stories and can't be here to tell them.]{.font4}

[Presently, I am the Director of the Rape and Sexual Assault Center in
Hennepin County. Pornography, like rape, is not about sex but about
control, hostility and violence. I have read in some of our papers that
there has been suggested that there is no connection between pornography
and sexual violence because there has never been a case on record of a
man walking into an adult bookstore and exiting ten minutes later to
pounce on a victim. I would agree, and add that since our first big
study on rape back in 1971, we know that rape is a planned act, rape is
not an act of impulse. It is an act that is well-nurtured in our
society.]{.font4}

[Rape is a social disease that is born in an environment that links sex
with violence and humiliation. For two years, I ran a group with another
woman at one of the men's correctional facilities in Minnesota. All of
these men, almost all of these men, were violent offenders and had
committed rape. Although\... in twelve years, only one was in prison for
rape. One man in our group admitted to raping over 100 women, I might
say bragged about raping over 100 women. He also admitted masturbating
to hard-core pornography before his crimes. Almost every one of the men
in the group admitted to masturbating to fantasies of violence. And most
of them acted out this violence against women or children.]{.font4}

[Let us use our common sense for a moment. When two things are linked by
something visual, we associate the two. When this association is
reinforced, it is likely to become a repeated behavior. Some of them
say ]{.font4}[it is a catharsis---if they look at pictures of women
being slashed and humiliated, then they won't have to do this in real
life, parents beating children and/or child abuse. Yet no one would
suggest that we all look at films of parents beating children in order
to end child abuse, or to watch films of Blacks, Indians, and Hispanics
being handcuffed and humiliated in order to end racism. There is no
reason, then, to suspect that pictures of bound and mutilated women will
decrease misogyny. Indeed, as many offenders in my experience have
noted, masturbating to fantasies of these images is extremely
reinforcing and in many cases led to their acts of sexual
violence.]{.sgc-3}

[We have seen cases at our own and other rape centers in Minnesota,
cases like one involving a mentally handicapped woman being taken to an
apartment, handcuffed to a steam pipe, having food shoved into her
vagina while dogs licked it out to the amusement of the spectator. Cases
like the woman who was tied by her heels and suspended upside down and
forced to perform oral intercourse with her husband, who later raped her
in the bathroom after urinating and defecating on her. Cases like the
man who never had intercourse with his wife unless it was in front of
other men he brought home from the local bar. I wonder where these ideas
came from?]{.font4}

[Many of us reacted with shock and horror to the gang rape of a woman on
a pool table in a bar in New Bedford in March of 1983, while bystanders
cheered and applauded. Yet in the January issue of]{.font4}
[Hustler,]{.font4} [a layout appeared of this exact scenario, a woman
spread-eagled on a pool table being gang-raped. I wonder if any of the
participants in New Bedford two months later were readers of]{.font4}
[Hustler.]{.font4}

[Permission to violate, once given, cannot be constrained. There is no
such thing as "slightly violated" or "a little bit raped," because
sexual violence is a continuum, not a hierarchy. Pornography is the
permission and direction and rehearsal for sexual violence. It is the
rape of our fantasy lives and, ultimately, the rape of our
bodies.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [have a letter from Marvin Lewis, to the
City Council, who is bringing cases for women against psychotherapists
who abuse their authority. I know we also have a statement by a woman
who works with prostitutes stating that many girls and young women are
directed into pornography and making a movie by being threatened with
physical harms. And the pictures are being taken and told they are for
private use and later are sold. \[Exh. 11; Exh. 12\]]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We also have a letter from Dr. Phyllis
Chesler who is a psychotherapist who describes in detail the effects of
pornography on women's self-esteem, and who believes that pornography
leads to chronic depression, self-hatred, and other extremely damaging
psychological states. \[Exh. 13\] And also a letter from Family and
Children's Services here in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Specifically about
pornographic abuse of women in psychotherapy by psychotherapists, the
uses of women in pornography to exploit women. \[Exh. 14\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let the record show these. Okay. Am I
saying this correctly? The next speaker is Daryl Dahlheimer. I hope I am
saying it correctly.]{.font4}

[DARYL DAHLHEIMER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You are. Well, I think I have a lot
to say that is similar. I will try to skip over the parts that are
repetitive. I do wish to say---and I am not embarrassed to be
repetitive---that we have been silent too long on the issue. I am
pleased we are spending a lot of time on the particular issue. As you
announced, my name is Daryl Dahlheimer and I am going to try to talk
about the connection of sexual violence and some of the offenders I work
with, and pornography.]{.font4}

[My background is a psychotherapist who has worked with both victims and
perpetrators of sexual violence. I spent the past two years working with
male felons in an alternative-to-prison treatment program in Hennepin
County, approximately half of whom are sex offenders. I can't claim to
hold any definitive or rigorous scientific data on the subject.]{.font4}

[I tried hard to answer the following questions in my practice. First,
what changes are necessary in the offenders' values and beliefs in order
to assure that he will not revictimize someone? And secondly, what
factors contribute to sexually violent behavior? I would like to share
some of my conclusions so far.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me, could you lift that up a
little more?]{.font4} 

[DAHLHEIMER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Before I start, I want to state several
understandings so that we have common definitions. My understanding of
sexual violence, with many forms, ranges from rape in marriage to sexual
assault on the streets to incest in families. And the common ground of
all of these is that sexual violence is prevalent in each of its forms,
and is fundamentally assaultive, not sexual, with women being the
primary target and women, excuse me, and men virtually having cornered
the market on who is the aggressor.]{.font4}

[The second understanding is that pornography is also prevalent, in both
written and picture form, and is distinguishable from erotica or sex
education material in that it specifically involves the demeaning or
degrading representation of women, men, or children.]{.font4}

[With that in mind, I'd like to tell you what I have learned in working
with sex offenders. First, sexual violence is not the work of the insane
or the inhuman. The rapist or molester is always seen as a stranger,
working in alleys and schoolyards, not as one of our own. This, I
believe, blurs the truth that sexual violence is learned behavior and
that we are all capable of it, given the proper training, distortions,
and permissions. In a study of motives of men who rape, Nicholas Groth,
one of the leading researchers in the area, identified that 95 percent
of rapes fall into patterns of anger in which sexuality becomes a
hostile act, or power in which sexuality becomes an expression of
conquest. I want to stress hostility and conquest are the primary
motivations in 95 percent of the rapes studied.]{.font4}

[Consider the following verbatim statements by several rapists who Groth
interviewed: "I wanted to knock the woman off her pedestal, and I felt
rape was the worst thing I could do to her." "She wanted it. She was
asking for it." "She just said 'no' so I wouldn't think she was easy." I
wish to state that we are witnessing violent acts, but often women are
pictured smiling, enjoying it. There are statements accompanying these
pictures and articles to the \[effect\] that women are supposedly
wishing to give in. So I wish to, you know, call your attention to the
fact that in terms of their own motives, there are some connections
between the pornography and what is going on with these
offenders.]{.font4}

[Secondly, sexual beliefs of men who are sexually violent tend to be the
following: women are perceived as seductive, manipulating, powerful. Men
are dichotomized into strong or weak, "studs" or "queers." He sees his
task as one of conquering women and competing with men. A sexual
encounter for him is getting something rather than sharing something.
And I think if you take a look at the pretty graphic representations of
what is mentioned, of what goes on in pornographic literature and
images, I think you will see similar images between pornography and the
basis of and outlooks of these offenders. Which brings me to my final
point. I want to help you understand some of the mechanisms by which
pornography may end up reinforcing sexual violence or creating sexual
violence.]{.font4}

[First is the fact that the sex offenders, it is well documented, tend
to view others---other people, particularly women---more as objects or
obstacles than as individuals. This is part of their belief system that
separates these people from their humanity and treats them as objects.
It is no secret that pornography can be objectification of women's
bodies and women's sexualities. In that particular way it may be a
reinforcement tool.]{.font4}

[Second, we know in the psychotherapy field that imagination and visual
imagery are powerful tools for shaping human behavior. It is no secret
that violent images have led to increased violence in people, and
violent images and pornography may give them rationales, minimizing the
pain, projection of blame, and other distortions along with the
image.]{.font4}

[The third is that we recognize as a society the importance of
prohibiting hate-material toward minority groups. Given the fact that
violent behavior has been shown to lead to imitative results after
exposure to violence on TV, I think this mechanism may work for the
offenders.]{.font4}

[It feels crazy to many of us working in therapy with offenders and
victims that society is so silent on what looks to us like a clear link
between written and visual images of victimization and acts of
victimization. In both my professional capacity and as a resident of
Minneapolis, I am grateful to this committee for taking steps to end
this silence. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Those of you who do have notes, if you
do read from them, please leave them with the City Clerk.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit some
additional documentation on the exact points that were made by Mr.
Dahlheimer. One is from a book called]{.font4} [The Rapist
File]{.font4}[. It is interviews with rapists as they discussed, as did
Mr. Dahlheimer, the use that the rapists themselves report making of
pornography. \[Exh. 15\]]{.font4}

[And I would also like to submit an interview excerpt written in the
form of a book about Ted Bundy, the mass murderer of women---interviews
with him, sections from that book. He said, this is the interviewer, he
states, '"Victims, you indicated that they would be symbols and images.
But I'm not really sure. Images of what? And Ted exclaimed, "Of women. I
mean, of the idealized woman. What else can I say? "' The interviewer,
"A stereotype? " This is Bundy, "No, they wouldn't be stereotypes
necessarily. But they would be reasonable facsimiles to women as a
class. A class not of women per se, but a class that has almost been
created through the mythology of women and how they are used as objects.

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would also like to submit a report from
the---it's an ongoing criminal case from which I have removed the names.
I do have the names. I have the name of the one victim who is not a
minor. I don't have the victims who are minors. It describes a young
woman who was abducted by a man who branded her and who burned her
viciously, and a number of other monstrosities. The same man is
being---is also simultaneously being---tried for the abuse of several
minors in which his modus operandi appears to be, from the allegations
in the complaint, that he would pick up young girls, show them
pornographic movies, keep them prisoners for several days up to a week
or whenever they could escape, during which time they were tortured,
raped, et cetera. So I am submitting those two complaints with all of
their numbers on them, but with the names of the individuals removed by
me. \[Exh. 17\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let the record show. Is that last one
you read from, is this something within the State of Minnesota?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. This last---the ones with the names
deleted---I believe it is, Chairman White. It is the State of Minnesota,
\[as\] the papers do reflect. Everything is on the papers except the
names of the individuals.]{.font4} [CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1}
[Bill Seals.]{.font4}

[BILL SEALS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Good evening, my name is Bill Seals. I am
the Director of Sexual Assault Services at the Center for Behavior
Therapy in Minneapolis. I have worked with hundreds of sex offenders
over the past ten years.]{.font4}

[Unfortunately, the relationship between pornography and sexual assault
gets mixed reviews in the literature. My experience has been that
pornography is often used by sex offenders as a stimulus to their
sexually acting out. The sexual insecurity of sex offenders is
reinforced by porn. Quite often sex offenders will use porn because they
think of it as being safe. They live vicariously through the pictures.
Eventually, that is not satisfying enough and they end up acting out
sexually.]{.font4}

[I believe we would have sex offenders even if we didn't have porn. I
also believe that we must make safeguards and take the measures which
are necessary to minimize sexual assault. Knowing that I was going to
appear here, I asked thirty-seven sex offenders of various types of
sexual assault how many of them had actually used pornography prior to
their sexually acting out. And of the thirty-seven, thirty-five of them
stated that they had at one time or another. Not all the time, at one
time or another.]{.font4}

[Whenever we read about another sexual assault case in the paper, we
instinctively react with rage. We cry out for stronger prison terms.
Seldom, however, do we ask why? Seldom do we look at the causes. Perhaps
if we take a look at those causes, which include pornography, we might
find that we have more control over preventing sexual assault than we
think.]{.font4}

[The relationship between pornography and sexual assault does exist. If
some therapists believe that pornography is a positive influence in
treating sexual dysfunction, then I suggest those therapists become a
little more creative in their therapeutic approach.]{.font4}

[All sex offenders have a warped perception of women. Let's not continue
to reinforce this belief by selling the tools of sexual assault.
Usually, I'm a First Amendment freak. But if I have to choose between
defending the First Amendment and protecting the rights of women and
children, I am going to choose the latter every time.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Cheryl Champion.]{.font4}

[CHERYL CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[My name is Cheryl Champion. I have worked in the field of sexual abuse
for twelve years, from 1971 to 1983. Since 1975\*, I have worked in
Minnesota. I have chosen to work in Minnesota because we have some of
the best laws in the United States for working in the field of sexual
abuse if you intend to do anything about it. I have been involved with
the Minnesota Coalition of Sexual Assault programs which represented
thirty-seven statewide programs and have been a member of the Board of
Directors of the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault, representing
programming across the United States. I have lectured on many of the
issues relating to sexual abuse, most recently, the relationship between
pornography and sexual violence, so it is most appropriate that I was
asked to testify today. I am willing to tell you what I have personally
observed in my clinical work with the victims and offenders involved in
sexually violent crimes.]{.font4}

[I am currently employed by Washington County Human Services, Inc., as
part of their Sexual Abuse Unit. My colleagues and I are responsible for
a multifaceted program that provides 24-hour crisis intervention and
advocacy to victims, individual therapy and support group counseling to
victims and their families, and an intervention program for juvenile sex
offenders, and a treatment program for families involved in the behavior
of incest. I do this to acquaint you with my experience in the field, so
that you can understand what I have to say.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me, you said also families who
are involved in incest?]{.font4}

[CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would first like to comment on the
incidents in which we have seen a direct relationship between
pornography and the crime. Although I am opposed to telling horror
stories, I think this is a time and place where this is appropriate. I
can tell you about a young married woman who we saw whose husband had
the house so filled with his collections of pornography, she was too
embarrassed to allow her inlaws or her family to come in. She finally
came to us for help when she was left hanging upside down in the
bedroom, even though the baby was crying and in need of
nursing.]{.font4}

[The second case I will tell you about is about the kidnap of two young
junior high school women in my county who were kidnapped on their way
home from school and taken out into the woods and held captive over
night by a young man who had constructed a very interesting tree fort in
which he had papered the walls with pornography, and spent two hours
assaulting these two fourteen-year-old girls following illustrations
from the pornographic magazines that he had collected.]{.font4}

[The third one I will tell you about is a gang of juveniles who papered
the attic to their parents' garage with pornographic magazines. They
kidnapped an eight-year-old neighborhood girl and gang-raped
her.]{.font4}

[They are not pleasant stories. They are not the only stories we hear. I
do not tell them to horrify people, but to state that pornography is
clearly connected with sexual assaults that we work with. It is not
uncommon for our victims to speak of the pornography involved in their
assaults when giving testimony to law enforcement and in the court and
in processing the incident in their therapy with us. I am continually
amazed that when we have public hearings like this, no one bothers to
ask the real experts. That is, the street cops. They should contact
Chief Bouza's investigators and find out just how much pornography they
collect and catalogue every time they get a search warrant and
investigate the residence of some sexual offenders.]{.font4}

[The second point is the prevalency of pornography amongst our
offenders. Because ours is an outpatient facility, the offenders we are
seeing come to us while they still live in the community. We are very
careful not to treat offenders that we judge to be at risk to the
community, that they would act out again. We are seeing the most, if you
will, innocuous members of the offending community. The more dangerous
are referred to locked inpatient facilities such as Lino Lakes and St.
Peter's Criminal Hospital. Even the exposers who are guilty of visual
rape in that they never physically touch their victims, to the more
disturbed juvenile offenders or the incest offenders who have violated
their own children, are heavily connected to pornography. Each of these
individuals has an active fantasy life involving the use of pornographic
materials for masturbation, fantasy contemplation, and eventual acting
out of their scenarios on their victims.]{.font4}

[One of the underlying philosophical \[tenets\] of our program is for
all offenders in treatment to clean out their homes, garages, cars, and
offices of pornographic materials. We are quite clear about not
rationalizing the content---everything: pin-ups, books, magazines, TV
cassettes and films. They must also contract with us not to use porn
during their treatment with us. There is active discussion in groups and
individual therapies about the inappropriate nature of pornographic
material. Those people who violate the rule are subject to group
criticism and a decision by the treatment facility whether or not they
will continue that treatment and \[revoke\] their probation.]{.font4}

[Several things are clear from our work with offenders and pornographic
materials. First, that porn takes over their lives to the exclusion of
any other entertainment material. Some of these people have collected
such a mass of pornographic material, their garages and basements are
full and they can't park their cars in the garage. It is an obsessive
relationship that they have with pornography. The second is that it is a
relief, a validating statement to the families of these offenders, when
we encourage them to clean out these collections. In some way, the
family has suspected all along that the porn had some connection to the
inappropriate sexual behavior.]{.font4}

[The behavioral impact of pornography can be summarized so: first of
all, that all of our offenders show that they were exposed to and
involved with pornography at a very early age.]{.font4}

[Two, that their secretive collections are significantly higher than
those we find in other populations of adolescents.]{.font4}

[Three, when more appropriate sexual education materials are available,
juveniles do not seem to need pornographic materials.]{.font4}

[Four, that most of our offenders in psychological testing seem
predisposed to violent acting out behavior. The question then becomes,
would they have chosen violent sexual acting out without the influence
of porn?]{.font4}

[I am not willing to make a statement about that, because we have not
done research that would stand up in the community.]{.font4}

[And five, we use porn as a tool for redefining sexual behavior and
orientation. It is clear to us that it does influence behavior. Sexual
gratification from porn is a strong reinforcer. We do much work to
redirect fantasy and gratification to more appropriate, less violent,
object-ori]{.font4}[ented self-gratification, and so we are using porn
as a way to hold up something that is negative to these men and teach
them how to redirect their fantasies and their lives and their
tempers.]{.font4}

[The final argument that I want to make is that I believe it is a very
sexist issue that those defenders of pornography will say to you that
porn is a portrayal of normal violent nature of men's sexuality. That is
the most sexist statement, and that says something also about men, if we
are to believe that men all have a violent expression of their
sexuality.]{.font4}

[The second thing I want to talk about is the saturation issue. We will
find that term in the literature is very clear, if you are a reader of
pornography. I have had to because of my work, that over the last twelve
years pornography has become more and more violent, that the themes in
it have become more and more explicit. It is, in a sense, as if we can't
get enough of it, and so once you have seen one murder, not so
explicitly, you need to have more and more portrayed realistically. You
will find that people become saturated, and those juveniles you see
starting out with low levels of magazines that simply portray nudity,
quickly move on to those how-to-rape-and-murder magazines that are
published.]{.font4}

[The third point that I want to ask is whether or not it is that
difficult for us to recognize hate. If you will flip through any of
these magazines, you will notice that the central themes are racist in
many of the portrayals that are of women. And the actors, who are \[put
there by\] pornographers, there tends to be a difference, in that often
the person is portrayed as a Black person or an Oriental person or an
ethnic member of a group. You will also notice that besides being
racist, there are a lot of themes of violence such as Nazi prison camps,
people who are held against their will and held powerless. It is a
literature of hate, and that is not very hard to understand if you were
to look at it.]{.font4}

[The fourth thing I want to say, \[is\] that I have seen a percentage
growth and a change in the people who are my victims. Twelve years ago
when I did this work, most of the people I dealt with, it looked like
the women in this room. They were white and middle-class and fairly well
educated. That has changed. The majority of the victims I see now are
children. The other change I have noticed is there was a percentage
increase in what I call child pornography. The explicit portrayal of
children being sexual with each other or adults. I think I can directly
correlate that with the increase in the number of child victims I
see.]{.font4}

[The fifth thing I would say, is whether or not porn causes violent acts
to be perpetrated against women is not really the question. Porn is
al]{.font4}[ready a violent act against women. It is our mothers, our
daughters, our sisters, and our wives that are for sale for pocket
change at the news stands in this country.]{.font4}

[The last thing I would like to say, is that porn does not exist in
isolation. It is not just in sleazy neighborhoods. You need to know that
the gang rape in the bar in Massachusetts which gained so much notoriety
was portrayed many months earlier in one of the top selling magazines in
this country as a pornographic picture outline.]{.font4}

[The central division is between the sense of rape as an act of
hostility and violence, as women see and know and experience it, and
rape as an erotic act, as fantasized by men and practiced by some. That
is a direct quote from a feminist writer who I think elucidates it very
clearly.]{.font4}

[In closing, I want to commend this public body for having the courage
to hear this sort of testimony and encourage you to maintain your
convictions in the face of those who would see this as no threat to our
community. I would urge you to vote for the safety and dignity of your
citizens, those you are elected to represent. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Ms. Champion, are there other reports
from police, say in Washington County, that show when they do arrests in
homes, what kind of material---]{.font4}

[CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you have---are there persons that
could come and speak, right here in this department?]{.font4}

[CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you like me to leave a list of names
or---]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I would.]{.font4}

[CHAMPION:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, the next speaker.]{.font4}

[GARY KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Gary Kaplan. I have not really prepared
anything to say. I am the Executive Director of Alpha Human Services,
which is an inpatient treatment program for sex offenders. It's the only
community-based inpatient program specifically for sex offenders in the
country. There is a handful of inpatient programs, although most are
within some type of institution.]{.font4}

[I am also the Director of Outpatient Treatment Programming for Sex
Offenders and a licensed psychologist. I have a private practice. As
part of my private practice, I do a great deal of court-ordered
psychological evaluations. I am currently, for instance, doing five
court-ordered psychological evaluations that are on my calendar
already.]{.font4}

[I don't have a prepared speech. On the other hand, I have a number of
years of experience with criminal sex offenders, probably about ten. I
was an adviser to the only private psychologist with male sex offenders
for a period of five years. I would like to say a few things about my
observations. Unfortunately, all of us that are here that are working
with criminal sex offenders lack hard data to say exactly what
percentage of sex offenders are linked in some way to pornography. Yet
most of my colleagues, I think, feel as I do: that clinically our
impression is that there is a substantial role that pornography plays.
Certainly with virtually all sexually-obsessed or preoccupied
individuals that we see, whether committing sex crimes or not,
pornography seems to be a pretty major role.]{.font4}

[I have heard a number of people talk and it really is true. I always
get the police reports and everything else when I am doing a court
order. And over and over again I end up seeing they, with a search
warrant, pulled out boxes of pornography. I am doing a court-ordered
psychological evaluation for Scott County right now---normally, I have
two actually in progress at the same time---and pornography played a
role in that, showing pornographic materials to fifteen-year-old girls
and getting them drugged in exchange for allowing them to engage in
sexual conduct.]{.font4} [CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Sir, are they
movies or magazines or what?]{.font4}

[KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In this particular incident, they were
videotapes. The psychological evaluation I just finished for Hennepin
County, for judge Schiefel-bein, actually they were magazines, boxes of
magazines and videotapes. Incidentally, that evaluation just went in the
mail yesterday. It is really recent. The sex offender had been arrested
in an adult bookstore for soliciting sex. He was anally penetrating his
son, twelve-year-old son, with his penis and also a son, fifteen years
old, from another marriage.]{.font4}

[Another way that we see pornography being used in the commission of
crimes is showing them to kids. I remember an interesting case in which
an ice cream man, a Good Humor man, always kept an open magazine by him
as he drove along, and the kids would look at it. And he would use that
as some kind of a manipulative technique to involve the people into
talking about sex or getting interested in sex, as a comment: have you
ever seen anything like this before, or have you ever done anything like
this previously. So, you know, there is certainly a number of ways that
pornographic materials are used. You know, written pornography is just
as troublesome,\... if not more so, and it would be a lot easier for us
in doing treatment with people if pornographic materials \*weren't
around. But in a lot of respects, the written pornographic materials are
as troublesome as those that are graphic or pictorial.]{.font4}

[We recently---by the way, in our programs we don't allow any
pornographic materials whatsoever. To my knowledge, most of the other
programs, of which there are two other inpatient programs in
Minnesota--- the treatment program in Lino Lakes and one down in St.
Peter---to my knowledge, I can't say for sure, they don't allow
pornographic materials to be used. At least, I am sure they discourage
the use of pornographic materials.]{.font4}

[At any rate, we recently found a fellow reading a book. But it is
illegal taking pictures of or soliciting one under the age of eighteen,
you know, for the purpose of engaging in obscene works. It is illegal,
but it does not seem to be difficult for sex offenders to become aroused
simply by reading photographically-detailed stories about deviant sexual
behavior or child molesting or something like that.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Kaplan, could you say, from your
clinical experience, do you see any relationship---that you have
observed---between what the people you treat choose to look at, in terms
of pornography, and what they actually do?]{.font4}

[KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. And I have said that a number of times to
different audiences. You can't say that, if you find an individual who,
let's say, has pornographic materials depicting children, you know, I
can't say with certainty that that person is going to engage in that
behavior, but I can certainly talk in terms of probabilities. And I feel
that there is an increased possibility that, in fact, that individual
can be seen at some time in the future to engage in that activity. Of
course, common sense will tell you, you know, people read pornographic
materials for the most part to attain some type of sexual arousal or
sexual feelings. And so, common sense would suggest that somebody wants
to look at pictures involving children engaging in some kind of sexual
behavior and that, at least to him, that that sexual fantasy represents
the hope for reality.]{.font4}

[Maybe I should mention a little bit about that role. There are two
schools of thought, that in fact deviant sexual fantasy is an outlet, or
enforcer. For those of us, certainly my colleagues---I have been doing
this for ten years---there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that
masturbation to deviant sexual fantasy reinforces and increases the
probability that that behavior will recur, as opposed to decreasing, as
it would \[if it\] became an outlet.]{.font4}

[I remember many years ago, we really may have been the first to take
that position, and I don't know of too many treatment programs that are
still encouraging people to masturbate to deviant fantasy. So, if you
look at sexual fantasy as a hope for reality, if you look at
masturbation or climax as a reinforcer---it hardly could be considered
punishment-you can see what we are doing is, we are pairing deviant
sexuality with pleasurable sexual feelings, which is
problematic.]{.font4}

[Offenders have an attachment between a particular sexual stimuli, a
deviant sexual stimuli or activity, and pleasurable sexual feelings. And
an analogy is that many men or women may find that they become sexually
aroused when they go out with somebody that wears a certain type of
perfume, or they smell a certain type of perfume, - and without a doubt
you can usually trace that, and there is some positive early sexual
experiences or encounters with someone who, say for a woman, someone who
she really cared about and felt very good about with a particular
cologne that that man wore. And there is a conditioning\], \[a\] kind of
attachment.]{.font4}

[Of course, that is our concern with pornographic materials, because
they are used as a stimulant. And what it does is, it pairs positive
sexual feelings with deviant stimuli, and particularly with those who
are somewhat backward sexually or at a young age and they are just
learning.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In deviance, do you
include something like battery or rape?]{.font4} [KAPLAN:]{.font7
.sgc-1} [Well, a sexual behavior---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are trying to be brief here. I don't
mean for you to go on.]{.font4}

[KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In diagnosing sexual deviance, look at the
target of sexual behavior. The type of rape is a certain way of deviant
type of sexual behavior, or you look at the motive of sexual
behavior.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I don't think I was through.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am glad she said it, because it was
coming.]{.font4}

[KAPLAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, I support the ordinance. I can't say
whether it is going to have a preventative effect. I do know that \[it\]
will make my life a whole lot easier in treating sex offenders. Criminal
sex offenders will go to great lengths to get pornographic materials. If
they are not accessible, it would make my life a lot easier.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[Nancy Steele.]{.font4}

[NANCY STEELE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[For twelve years, I have worked in prisons in Colorado and Minnesota,
providing direct clinical treatment services to men convicted of sex
offenses, rape, incest, and child molesting. For years, I've heard them
talk in depth about their feelings about themselves, their crimes and
their sexuality. These are my own personal professional opinions I have
formed in listening to them over the years on the relationship between
their crimes and pornography. I also want to say that some of my
opinions are based on research that I did for my doctorate.]{.font4}

[At that time, I was trying to research fantasy. This is a nonpublished
dissertation. I started out with that new idea of catharsis. And I used
violent offenders and nonviolent offenders in a fairly complicated
design. And the net result showed the opposite of what I had predicted,
and was \[inconsistent with all the other literature and research I had
read for my dissertation, that the angry fantasies increased anger in
the offenders. What was of particular importance was that it increased
it most in the most violent offenders, the most sadistic offenders.
^13^]{.font4}

[What I want to say about a sex offender, and what I have learned about
them, is that they are a long time in the making. It doesn't happen
suddenly with no cause. There are always long-standing background
reasons for their crimes and generally triggers in their current
emotional environment that bring about the crimes. Pornography is both a
cause and an effect of their emotional problems and very frequently
plays a major part in their assaults on women and children. They
generally will increase their consumption of pornography prior to sex
offenses. They will get very specific ideas in reading pornography of
exactly what they will do in their crimes, to whom they will do it in
their crimes.]{.font4}

[Certain types of them live years of their life in a fantasy world,
isolated from real human relationships. They don't have emotional
pairing relationships with other people, they don't have positive
messages and values of sexuality, they don't see sexuality as a loving
expression of things. What they see in their homes, and what they read,
and what they hear in the media, is what they tend to believe about
sexuality.]{.font4}

[One man said to me just last week in group---he had been molesting his
daughter over and over and over, and he knew it was wrong, and he felt
terrible and hated himself. But, he said, I read about it in a magazine,
I read how the children really like this, how they want their fathers
to]{.font4}

[abuse them. I knew it wasn't right, but it gave me the excuse I needed
to keep on doing it. They \[turn\] to pornography as a way to sort of
satiate an appetite that grows in themselves. It doesn't satiate them.
It is like drinking salt water. The more they drink, the more they need,
the more they have to seek to get what they believe they
deserve.]{.font4}

[For very lonely, very disturbed, angry men, pornography is a way in
which they practice their crimes of sexual assault. They read stories,
watch movies, and masturbate to angry destructive stories of rape and
degradation. Over and over, they pair their fantasies with masturbation,
ejaculation, and sexual release. Through a very basic conditioning
process, their sexual response becomes conditioned to anger, violence,
and shame. Some reach the point where they cannot feel sexual feelings
in a loving and respectful context with women they care about. Fantasy
is not harmless for many people. Certainly not all, but for many people,
fantasy leads to action.]{.font4}

[I do not believe that pornography would make abusers out of most men.
Most men are as disgusted by sadistic pornography as most women are. We
have to recognize that there are all too many men who live very lonely,
unhappy lives, and for whom pornography is like a loaded gun. There are
also a lot of adolescent girls and boys who are very curious about
sexuality who are willing to try dangerous or forbidden things, and they
too are vulnerable to the ideas, messages, and feelings in
pornography.]{.font4}

[So,  we have to ask ourselves as a society: just what values do we
believe in? What message do we want to give to people about violence and
sexuality? Why are we condoning and in some ways supporting the very
sick destructive proliferation of materials that can only harm other
human beings?]{.font4}

[I don't believe that the offender is here today that I had asked to
come. He may have had trouble with the weather. Is he here? No, I guess
not.]{.font4} [HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to ask you a
question, based on your professional life. Is it fair to say that the
men you work with use violent pornographic materials as they are feeling
these feelings of anger and frustration and self-loathing? Because, you
know it is awfully hard to separate out erotic material.]{.font4}

[STEELE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I mean, it isn't hard for me. I know what I
think is erotic, and I know what I think is dangerous, because a woman
in a sexual pose who is there without any whips and chains is erotic.
Somebody tied to a bed with blood running out of their nose and mouth is
violent. I was wondering, did you ever get into what kinds, I would
guess it would be violent stuff?]{.font4}

[STEELE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [For the violent rapist, they tend to use
violent material. Child molesters use child pornography. I am not
against erotic or sexual literature. We use it to condition child
molesters to be turned on by adult sexuality. I am against sexuality
which is portrayed in a degrading or violent context.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Now, the next speaker is Michael
O'Brien. Are there people in the hall? If they are, have them come in,
especially if they are speakers.]{.font4}

[Michael O'Brien?]{.font4}

[UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He is not in the hall.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Not in the hall. Okay.]{.font4}

[RICHELLE LEE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Richelle Lee. I work with sex
offenders. I work with the State of Minnesota Department of Corrections,
in Oak Park Heights currently, and I also worked at Lino Lakes for one
year. I recently have been establishing a sex offender program at Oak
Park Heights. I have also worked extensively with victims in sexual
family abuse.]{.font4}

[Basically I would validate the rest of the comments made by other sex
offender therapists. So I will keep myself brief for your benefit and
mine.]{.font4}

[I have yet to work with an offender that does not use pornography. I
have had a number of offenders who made the statement that pornography,
they believe for themselves, was directly responsible for where they got
their ideas---very early in their lives they were exposed to
pornography---and that these messages and images about women, about what
sexuality is, this is where they got their education. And they believe
that that exposure early in their life had a direct effect upon them as
to why they then acted out later on.]{.font4}

[Offenders that I work with in the Department of Corrections said the
pornography is for sale, insofar as]{.font4}
[Playboy]{.font4}[,]{.font4} [Penthouse, Screw]{.font4} [magazine and
other contraband magazines that are sold by the prison itself in the
commissary. I think the sale of pornography right there happens to
condone it. Our society is condoning those images and messages about
women.]{.font4}

[I spend hours in groups a day with men discussing their attitudes about
women, their beliefs about sexuality. They, in fact, fit stereotypically
with those images of women, that they like to be raped, that they like
to be beaten. They are very open about that. They find it difficult to
change those ideas and opinions. After spending hours in a group, they
go back to their cells where they read the magazines and have the
pin-ups on the walls.]{.font4}

[I think the sale of pornography, at least from my perspective, has
increased \[to\] where any grocery store I walk in, any gas station I
walk in, is selling those magazines. There is something terribly wrong
with the fact that our bodies can be sold as a commodity on any shelf,
that most of the magazines, I know in one store I visit quite regularly,
are on the bottom shelf where any child---even though there are plastic
covers on those---any child can see those.]{.font4}

[The incest women that I work with report that they were shown pictures
of pornography by their uncles or fathers or aggressors to show them how
it was done---that this is in fact what they were about, what they were
for, and that this is okay.]{.font4}

[Basically, I will just validate the rest of what has been said, and I
think that the overuse of pornography, and the frequent selling of it,
and the readily availableness of it is---let's not have it. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I thank you for making it brief,
because there are quite a few people who have signed up, some who signed
up last night that didn't get a chance to speak and also are here again
tonight. But, we will get to you.]{.font4}

[Paul Gerber from the Hennepin County Bureau of Criminal
Apprehension?]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He doesn't seem to be here.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Charlotte Kasl?]{.font4}

[CHARLOTTE KASL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Charlotte Kasl. I am a therapist
in private practice. I work with adult women survivors of sexual abuse
as well as children of these survivors and the families. I also come
from a---I have been doing therapy for about seven years with the
victims and survivors.]{.font4}

[I want to make two points. Basically I want to connect pornography as
sexual addiction, and I want to connect sexual addiction to childhood
sexual abuse. I also want to say I am just terrified talking here. I
don't know when I have been so scared speaking about something as this
issue. I think it is loaded emotionally. It is hard to stay focused on
the issues. I hear about it so much because I work with abuse.]{.font4}

[It has been my experience that pornography is an integral part of
sexual addiction, and sexual addiction is an integral part of child
abuse. And as these are addictions, they follow a course of escalation.
They]{.font4}

[follow a course of compulsion. They are out of control. The addict
using pornography is on a spiral, on a course that is getting worse that
leads to escalation of the sexual acting out, whether it be peeping Tom,
whether it be molesting children, exposing himself and so forth. I think
by opening up this issue about pornography and sexuality and sexual
addiction, we are going to open up the whole area around child abuse and
around the way we need to redefine what is sexual instead of what is
violence.]{.font4}

[All children who live in the home---this is my opinion---all children
who live in the home of a sexual addict at some level become victims of
that addiction. And that person does not have to bring pornography home
for that to happen. The energy that person carries, the fantasies, the
thoughts, the way they talk and look at their female children,
communicates something about this child to their bodies. Young girls
talk about, "I couldn't stand it when my father touched me. There was
something wrong. " Some direct connections I have talked about with
clients, and they said they were glad to have the stories here. They
felt it was so important.]{.font4}

[One example, for instance, was a young girl. By the age of four, she
saw her parents sitting on the couch together reading pornographic
magazines. When she tried to go join them, they were laughing and happy.
She said it was the only time she saw her father's eyes light up. He
felt alive. When she would try to read, they said no, no, which was
confusing because they seemed happy reading this. By five years old,
this young woman, at that time a young girl, would bring boys from the
neighborhood, draw off her clothes the way she had seen in the
magazines, and let herself be abused sexually. This is by five years
old. This woman has gone through a great deal of work. She was
alcoholic, very ill. She is now a student. She is now working through
these things in therapy and is recovering, but she had never herself
made the connection to the pornography. All she felt about herself
\[was\], she was crazy, she was sick. How at five years old could I have
been doing this? Pornography in the home is insidious. Girls pick up the
message, they act it out, they don't know why they feel suicidal and
crazy. I have seen this many, many times.]{.font4}

[Another example I would like to share with you was a little boy I
worked with whose father was preoccupied with pornography and had a
house full of it. The little boy was known at school as the kisser. He
would jump at girls, grab them, and kiss them. He was already developing
an abuser mentality by the age of six. This happens to children, again,
without them knowing it. He wanted to be like his father. That is
what]{.font4}

[his father liked. He was doing what every child will do. It models for
children that sexuality has power and that women are basically pieces of
meat.]{.font4}

[A third example was in a very abusive violent family where the father
had read a great deal of pornography. It was kept in his room and the
children knew it was there. He beat his children a lot, his daughters
particularly. The girls used to sneak in when the parents were gone,
read the pornography. They became addicted to it. It was their only
escape, as it had been their father's escape. The woman that reported
it---today at thirty---is addicted to pornography, has yet to have
intimate sexual relationships or free herself from the connection of
silence and sexuality. I think the growing use of twelve-step groups for
sexual addicts and co-addicts in the city of Minneapolis will say that
the awareness here is growing extremely quickly, and we have a lot to be
proud of, that we are opening up the issues.]{.font4}

[Another woman with a battering father, she saw her father read a great
deal of pornography. She came away imprinted in her mind that all her
father was interested in was sex, which generalized too that all men
must always be interested in sex and no men can be trusted. When she was
around them, she thought, whet is my father thinking of me. In both
these cases, the fathers were silent with the daughters. I believe a lot
of battering of young girls has to do with sexual feelings, much of what
comes every time in families where there was pornography. The father
feels sexual towards his daughter, wants to repress that, and instead of
taking responsibility for his addiction, which is out of his control,
beats his daughter. It is connected many times. I have had fathers open
up to this when they come to family therapy and talk about it.]{.font4}

[Myself, I was in therapy some years back. I walked into a drug store
and saw my therapist reading a pornographic magazine. I actually froze
in my tracks. I felt so abused. In therapy with this man I always
thought, "what is he thinking of me, what is he thinking when he sees my
body? " I know the feelings I had, were those \[the\] children had. This
was a trusted person I put my faith into, and I never could get past it.
And I, at that time, didn't know enough or didn't have the feeling to
speak, just as a child doesn't know enough to speak. They don't have the
ability. They believe whatever goes on at home must be normal. These
things are imprinted to children. They are dangerous to
children.]{.font4}

[The last example is going into a local grocery store there to return
grapefruit. There was in the back room a picture of a naked woman from
the back with a little diagram saying rump, ribs, shoulder, like they do
with cows. I was upset. The first time I saw it, I couldn't talk. I came
back later, walked in and saw it again. I was incredibly amazed that the
store could have this. This is damaging. I said to the man, "I find this
offensive, returning white grapefruit for pink ones and standing here
with my daughter, that my daughter is a piece of meat, and her mother is
a piece of meat. " He finally took it down.]{.font4}

[The fact is that we need to wake people up. I think Minneapolis has an
incredible opportunity to put themselves on the map as a very strong
forerunner in these liberties for women and making us feel free, to make
us not feel we are violated and not see ourselves as meat.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White, I would like to submit a
couple documents now from Minneapolis that are in the same vein as the
testimony that was just given. I will not read them.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The first is from the Family Nurturing
Center. I will note, in it, children are exposed to pornography, and
this can include child pornography and adult pornography. Even the
exposure in that way leads to people responding in later life, at that
time, as if they were actual incest victims. \[Exh. 18\]]{.font4}

[I am also submitting a letter to the City Council from the Kiel Clinics
in Minneapolis talking about the use of pornography in the abuse of
children and adult women. \[Exh. 19\] And a letter from VOICE,
Incorporated, which is a national organization for victims of incest, to
the City Council talking about the place of pornography in incest.
\[Exh. 20\] And all of these letters are expressing support for this
ordinance.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Joan Weber?]{.font4}

[Sue Santa?]{.font4}

[SUE SANTA:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am Sue Santa. I work with a local
nonprofit private organization in Minneapolis called Minneapolis Youth
Division. My position there is outreach worker working exclusively with
adolescent females involved in prostitution. Over the course of the
years, six years that I have been there, I noticed a direct correlation
between pornography and prostitution with my clients. I can say almost
categorically never have I had a client who has not been exposed to
prostitution through pornography in one way or the other. For some young
women, that means that they are shown pornography---either films,
videotapes, or pictures---as, this is how you do it, almost as a
training manual in how to perform acts of prostitution.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me. You are saying they are
pimps training them with those kinds of messages?]{.font4}

[SANTA:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is correct.]{.font4}

[In addition, out on the street when a young woman is plying her trade,
as it were, many of her tricks or customers will come up to her with
little pieces of paper, pictures that were torn from a magazine and say:
I want this. As one client put it, it is like a mail order catalogue of
sex acts, and that is what she is expected to perform.]{.font4}

[Another way that pornography plays a part in the lives of my clients is
that as young women, very young women, some as young as eleven, they
want the good things that are to be had in the United States. They want
the kinds of things that they see on TV, and they see taking part in
nude modeling, taking part in movies---pornographic movies---as a way to
be a star, get to Hollywood. Now, this may seem foolish to those of you
who are adults and say ha ha, we know that is wrong. We are talking
about children who are very naive and are told that Marilyn Monroe made
it this way, Brooke Shields made a movie about]{.font4} [Pretty
Baby.]{.font4} [You have been there baby, you can do it.]{.font4}

[Another aspect that plays a big part in my work with my clients is
that, on many occasions, my clients are multi-, many-, rape victims.
These rapes are often either taped or have photographs taken of the
event. The young woman, when she tries to escape or leaves, is told that
either she continues in her involvement in prostitution or those
pictures will be sent to her parents, will be sent to the juvenile
court, will be used against her. And out of fear, she will continue her
involvement in prostitution.]{.font4}

[On several occasions, not many but on several occasions, these young
women have found that later that their pictures have been published in
pornographic magazines without their knowledge and consent. This is very
traumatic, especially when I have been working hard with this young
woman to make things in her life better. She is involved in the straight
lifestyle and finds out there are published pictures of her engaged in
various sex acts.]{.font4}

[I would like to close with a comment of one of my clients who heard I
was going to be here tonight who said, "It is about time that those
folks figured out what is going on. " Thank you.]{.font4}

[SHERRY ARNDT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Sherry Arndt, and I am a
moderator and trainer with the Illusion Theater here in Minneapolis. The
Illusion Theater is a theater based in Minneapolis which has, since
1977, had a child sexual abuse prevention program as part of its
theater.]{.font4}

[Many people, I think, are probably aware of our existence and some of
the work that we do. We perform two plays, one called]{.font4}
[Touch]{.font4}[, which is for elementary students and helps explain to
children what the difference is between good and bad touch, and what
they can do when they are confused by touch. Our second play is called
No]{.font4} [Easy Answers]{.font4}[, and it is for a teenage audience
and helps---it covers the material presented in]{.font4}
[Touch,]{.font4} [and enlarges on that to cover as well as images in
advertising, sexual decisionmaking, acquaintance rape and incest, and
other pertinent information that is interesting to teen-agers.]{.font4}

[We also do numerous workshops for parents, community groups, and
professional groups on the area of child sexual abuse prevention. We
have performed in over thirty-five states to over 280, 000
people.]{.font4}

[My only background is as a public health nurse. I worked for eleven
years in public school systems, nine of those years serving as a founder
and representative on our county's child abuse team.]{.font4}

[Our two plays are based on research done in the Minneapolis public
schools with school children. They are based \[on\], and also use, the
actual comments of children in the plays as well as comments from
victims, comments from offenders, and some of the actors who
corroborated\... the plays' own experiences.]{.font4}

[And in a recently published major study of child sexual abuse by David
Finkelhor, who is a major researcher, in a major study published, one of
the reasons that children gave for why they did not report that they had
been sexually abused was that they were confused by the offender's
insistence that the sexual behavior was normal and that other people
liked the activity.]{.font4}

[One of the most common ways that offenders do convince children\...
that the sex is normal and pleasurable, or should be pleasurable, is
through showing them pornographic pictures of other children engaged in
sex acts, looking as though they enjoy it. This is also one of the main
ways that offenders coerce children into posing for pornographic
photographs, is by showing them other pictures of other children and
saying, "Well, everybody else likes it. There must be something wrong
with you if you don't find this pleasant, " and "Gee, you know you liked
it the last time we were together. " Offenders are very seductive with
children.]{.font4}

[In all of our work---and as I said, we travel extensively---we see over
and over again a confusion that exists between what is okay and what is
not okay in the whole area of sex, between what is sexuality and what is
violence. This confusion is brought about in large part by pornography
as well as other images in our culture that confuse us about what we are
supposed to be like, and what other people are like, and how we are
supposed to act. In fact, this is so pervasive that I think the
influence of pornography has seeped into other written material that
most of us don't consider pornography.]{.font4}

[I brought with me a couple of examples of that: \'the December issue
of]{.font4} [Harper\'s Bazaar]{.font4}[; which shows an eight-year-old
girl in a perfume ad. She is dressed seductively. The photograph has
made sure that her nipples are exposed. Part of the copy in this article
is "Jasmine and Gardenia for seduction, with just a hint of innocence.
Dreams of far away places synonymous with elegance, the height of
confident femininity. " I think it is not difficult for any of us to see
the influence of pornography in this magazine article. I also have
another article from the December issue of]{.font4} [Vogue~9~]{.font4}
[which shows a photograph of a woman elegantly dressed in evening wear,
fondling a naked, about fourteen-year-old boy. The caption on this is,
"Age makes no difference. " Neuher magazine would probably be identified
by most of us as pornographic.]{.font4}

[So much confusion exists in our culture about the differences between
sexuality and violence that we are currently working on a third dramatic
piece that will be for adult audiences, and it will specifically focus
on the confusion between sexuality and violence that exists in our
culture. When society sanctions violence, especially violent use of sex
against women and children, this attitude and resulting behavior begin
to be defined as normal and natural. I think we have heard testimony to
that over and over again today. I don't think I need to give any
examples of that here.]{.font4}

[When healthy sexual attitudes are prohibited by society, they begin to
be defined as unnormal and unnatural. Sexuality and violence are used in
our culture to the point that they are not separated in our minds, nor
are they separated in our behaviors.]{.font4}

[It is my position that we must separate sexuality and violence. This
ordinance certainly speaks toward a good beginning to do that. We must
accept the normality of sexuality and the seeking of pleasure or we will
see increase in individual and group violence. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Christopher Street
representative?]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think they said they were unable to make
it.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Sue Schafer?]{.font4}

[SUE SCHAFER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Sue Schafer. I am a
psychologist in private practice. And over the last eight years, I would
say at least half of my clients have been physically or sexually abused.
I just arrived, and I don't have the history to know what has been
addressed. The point I would like to make is similar to the previous\'
speaker, Sue Santa, who talked about how pornography is used as training
guides. While Sue talked about how the underworld often uses it to
solicit young ladies for prostitution, I would like to talk about how
pornography is used by acquaintances or family members, again as
guidelines or as recipe books.]{.font4} [CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1}
[It seems to me since 1: 30 of yesterday that I have been hearing more
and more, it seems to be that the family structure is a part of the
problem. And could you speak to that?]{.font4}

[SCHAFER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, I think the example that I am planning
to use may address that. I would like to state three present or
near-present cases that I am working with, where family members or
acquaintances have used pornography as recipe books. Presently or
recently I have worked with clients who have been sodomized by broom
handles, forced to have sex with over twenty dogs in the back seat of
their car, tied up and then electrocuted on their genitals. These are
children or in the ages of fourteen to eighteen, all of whom I could
have found a direct impact by pornography, either where the perpetrator
has read the manuals and manuscripts at night and used these as recipe
books by day, or had the pornography present at the time of the sexual
violence. And so, as the previous speaker talked about, the importance
of separating sex and violence, I recognize. I think any step to take or
eliminate pornography would be a step in the direction of separating out
sex and violence.]{.font4}

[Another further complication I see in working with the clients, as
children---once these children grow up into adults, there becomes a
tremendous link between sex and violence, so much so that in their mind
that sadomasochistic behaviors are something they fight, oftentimes on a
daily basis. For these children that grow up and become adults,
oftentimes sex becomes impossible without some form of self-mutilation
or violence. So while it is directly connected with their adult sexual
activity, it is also connected in a general sense with self-mutilating
types of behaviors that continue. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White, I would like to submit a
few documents at this time.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [would also offer a brief interpretation
of the evidence, in answer to your question. Perhaps one way to think
about what we have heard about family is that we have illustrated that
the family is no exception to the abuses that exist of women and
children throughout this society. The documents I would like to submit,
the first three are by writers, each of whom has submitted a statement
to the Minneapolis City Council on the occasion of the consideration of
this ordinance. They are all writers in the area of incest and child
abuse.]{.font4}

[The first is by Trudee Able-Peterson, who wrote the book]{.font4}
[Children of the Evening]{.font4}[, which is looking at child
prostitution in America. \[Exh. 21\] The second is by Katherine Brady,
who wrote the book]{.font4} [Father's Days.]{.font4} [And she brings up
a statement about her own particular experience of incest and how
pornography plays in that, as well as other accounts from her knowledge
of the subject. \[Exh. 22\]]{.font4}

[The third is a letter from Louise Armstrong, who wrote the
book]{.font4} [Kiss Daddy Goodnight]{.font4}[, a speakout on incest.
\[Exh. 23\] She wrote a letter and extensive statement to the
Minneapolis City Council connecting her research on incest with
pornography.]{.font4}

[A fourth letter to the Minneapolis City Council comes from Incest
Survivors Resource Network International from New York who
"enthusiastically endorses your efforts in bringing the relationship of
incest and pornography to a public forum. " \[Exh. 24\]]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let the record show.]{.font4}

[Floyd Winecoff?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He is unable to come.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Michael Laslett?]{.font4}

[MICHAEL LASLETT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Michael Laslett. Before I
read my own statement, I would like to read a statement of a
psychologist by the name of Floyd Winecoff, who was unable to be here
this evening. He has been working with men for many years. The title of
his statement is "Pornography and its Effects on Men. "]{.font4}

[My expertise in addressing this subject comes from a 10-year
psychotherapy practice specializing in services for men. My practice has
included over the years an ongoing treatment group for men who are
physically, verbally, or sexually abusive. I have repeatedly found a
direct link between pornography and attitudes towards women as objects
that contribute to the ongoing crime of violence against women.]{.font4}

[The myth about pornography is that it frees the libido and gives men an
outlet tor sexual expression which liberates mind and body. This is
truly myth. I have found that pornography not only does not liberate
men, but on the contrary becomes a source of bondage. Men masturbate to
pornography only to become addicted to the fantasy. There is no
liberation for men in pornography. Pornography becomes a source of
addiction much like alcohol. There is temporary relief. It is mood
altering. And it is reinforcing, i. e. "you want more" because "you got
relief. " It is this reinforcing characteristic that leads men to want
the experience which they have in photographic fantasy to happen in
"real" life.]{.font4}

[An endless search ensues to capture the docile woman of fantasy in
total real life availability. The more hopeless it is to find this sort
of woman, the more desperate becomes the interaction between men and the
women they pursue.]{.font4}

[The problem arises when real women do not like being dominated,
controlled, and "made love to" on one-sided terms. When women assert
themselves, men experience a loss of the feeling of being in control.
Violence occurs in men when their own personal concept of "masculinity"
is challenged. A man who is already addicted to the feeling of needing
to have sex, and the fantasy of being in control, becomes desperate in
his behavior when confronted by a woman who doesn't want what's being
given out.]{.font4}

[Women lose, and men lose too. Women lose, of course, because they are
the object of this abusive pursuit. Men lose because they never
experience true intimacy that comes from letting down and opening up
with someone. Many men let down and open up when there is a threat of
losing the relationship; but violence is a more common
occurrence.]{.font4}

[There is no social communion in domination and control. By nature we
are social beings, and as such require true social interaction for
well-be-ingness. Without such social communion, there exists only
isolation and desperation.]{.font4}

[Pornography portrays a fantasy of social communion, but in reality it
contributes to the desperation that leads men to abusiveness. There is
no difference between the person who will lie, steal, cheat, or kill in
order to get the drug or chemical of addicted choice. Pornography is the
chemical of sexual addiction.]{.font4}

[And my own statement. I have been raised and socialized in a
pornographic society. Pornographic images of women have surrounded and
bombarded me throughout my life---images which depict women primarily as
sexual objects available to me at any time, as sexually submissive, as
meaning yes even when they say no, as always wanting sex, and as finding
abuse sexually enjoyable.]{.font4}

[Everywhere I go, I carry a pornographic notion of what an "attractive"
woman is, what she looks like, how she acts, what she says, and so on. I
have been infected with pornographic, sexist, and blatantly oppressive
expectations of women as friends, co-workers, passers-by, lovers. My
sexism, however, is not a haphazard occurrence. I am the result of a
systematic socialization process which trains all men to oppress women,
because it is in the interests of men as the economic, political,
sexual, and cultural rulers of this society to keep women down.
Pornography is a crucial tool in the maintenance of male power.]{.font4}

[While consolidating this male supremacist system, pornography also
directly harms men as individuals. For most of my life, I accepted
pornographic definitions of women---how large were their breasts, their
buttocks, their waist. I was only attracted to women who met very narrow
standards, and my sense of self-worth depended, in large part, on how
many such women were interested in me. But pornography portrays women as
insatiable. So while, for the good of my self-image and my status in the
eyes of my male friends, I wanted as many women as possible to be
attracted to me, I was also terrified of being sexually
inadequate.]{.font4}

[Even after I became aware of my sexism and its link to pornography, I
couldn't simply shed a lifetime of socialization. I couldn't escape the
perceptions of women I had been taught. I began to hate myself for being
sexist and for finding pornography arousing.]{.font4}

[For years, I couldn't interact with a woman without feeling that I was
oppressing her, especially if I found her attractive. Since physical
lovemaking is one of the most intimate forms of interaction, and since
it has been so twisted and mutilated by pornography, I couldn't sleep
with a woman without feeling that I was oppressing her because my
attraction for her had been influenced by pornography. I am still
struggling with these feelings today.]{.font4}

[Women are assaulted daily by and because of pornography, and my life
and sexuality have been warped and distorted by it. Countering these
effects of patriarchy will be a lifetime endeavor. I urge you to pass
this legislation to help us in the task of dismantling our crippling
pornographic images. Let us work so that women will be less oppressed,
that men will be less well-trained to oppress them, and that women and
men will be free to live healthier and more equal lives. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [May I please put these documents into
evidence. I am sorry that Chairman White isn't here. He has been
expressing a desire to have confirmed his perception that pornography
does hurt men in a very serious way. And we would like to end by
submitting a part of a book by an author named Timothy Beneke on rape,
which documents the relationship between pornography and men's attitudes
on rape. \[Exh. 25\] And in addition, a letter from an individual named
Jim Lovestar who talks about how he feels that pornography has hurt him
as a man because it has genuinely decreased his intimacies. And he is
from Minneapolis. \[Exh. 26\]]{.font4}

[And I would also like to submit into evidence a letter from John
Stoltenberg, who is originally from Minneapolis, who is not living here
now. He is the Chair of the Antipornography Task Group of the National
Organization for Men. And that group sponsors this ordinance. And Mr.
Stoltenberg has had a lot of experience doing workshops on pornography
with men, and men find it to be extremely disorienting and disruptive to
their social learning behavior, and I think that he is representing a
political opposition among men to the existence of pornography. So I
submit this letter also. \[Exh. 27\] Thank you.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Ms. Dworkin, I will tell you that we do have
microphones, we do have speaker boxes back in our offices. And from time
to time, as you see committee members getting up and leaving, they are
not out of hearing of the hearing going on. And Chairman White, I am
sure, is listening.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. I was concerned only because the
Chairman, I think, has been very clear about his own feelings in that
direction and in the course of these hearings.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Anything further? We will move on to Omar
Johnson.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman?]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Go ahead, Charlee.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I will go ahead. I would like to reiterate the
statement---the longer we are here, the tireder we seem to become---as
we hear all testimony tonight, either in agreement or in opposition of
your feelings, I ask that you give all credence---inasmuch, don't hiss,
don't boo. Please let people have their say.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right. Mr. Johnson, proceed. Give your
name and address.]{.font4}

[OMAR JOHNSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Omar Johnson, 1920 Third Avenue South,
Apartment ]{.font4}[21.  And I'm going to be talking about
myself.]{.sgc-2}

[I was raised in Ecuador on a mission compound. The school library was
well-censored. My sexual life began quite late. In fact, I was a junior
at Dartmouth College before I even masturbated. The procedure, I
remember, was self-conscious, primitive, even silly. But at the moment
of orgasm, there was an image. I saw a green, grassy knoll put of which
popped a white rabbit and it looked at me quizzically, then bounded
away, cotton tail flipping through the foliage. It's an image that will
always stay with me: the fertility of the rabbit, the continuing
virginity of the whiteness, nothing ever lost that cannot be regained,
and the green, green earth all around.]{.font4}

[Of course, this poetry didn't last too long. I had a friend down the
hall that introduced me to another bunny. It was so legitimate---an
interview with Jimmy Carter and everything. The pictures gave me a
feeling somewhere between queasiness and arousal. I didn't know what to
do or think about them. But the section where readers write in to the
editor detailing their exploits solved that problem. I was a very quick
study. I mean, I had already internalized messages suggesting that women
were second-class creatures. I mean, I lived in a society that had
applauded me when I knocked someone out on the football field and then
wandered around in a daze myself for a couple of minutes. Violence as
pleasure was something I already knew. This was just another context. By
the end of the year I was stringing together long involved fantasies
where women did what I wanted and loved me for it.]{.font4}

[Then---I am out of college now---I met and got involved with a real
woman. She was very special in that she did not have the capacity to
seem simpler than she was. It was I who would have to learn to live with
and love her complexity. It has not been easy. She is very sensitive to
what she calls "connectedness. " I could not manage it. Trying hard to
do right by her, I failed miserably, got frustrated, used to storm out
of the house yelling, "What more can I give? " I have never been
physically violent with her, but there have been occasions when I was so
enraged at my inability to love---and I think that is an important
connection---that I got angry at her, and then I found myself in an
adult bookstore reading my fantasies. As I said before, women felt fear,
and pleasure, and fulfillment, according to my whim.]{.font4}

[But all this time---perhaps because I remembered the beauty and
creativity of my first sexual image, which I found very ludicrous at the
time. By the way, I knew her way with sex and with love was what I
wanted. My point is, that if women in a society filled by pornography
must be wary for their physical selves, a man, even a man of good
intentions, must be wary for his mind. My spill into pornography felt
like a congenital weakness, like getting a hernia. Perhaps it is only a
cultural weakness. The point is, for me, having porn around was like the
freedom to fall into a trap that I have been a long time climbing out
of.]{.font4}

[I would like, very much, to get back to following the rabbit of my own
dreaming. I do not want to be a mechanical goose-stepping follower of
the]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [bunny, because that is what I think it
is. Porn makes me feel goose bumps as well as erections. These are the
experiments a master race perpetuates on those slated for
extinction.]{.font4}

[Now, the woman I live with is Jewish. She makes me think about the
connection. She was very afraid after the brutal rape and beating a
couple of weeks ago which happened a couple blocks from our apartment.
She tried to joke about arming herself with a frying pan and was
comfortable with organizing a frying pan brigade. But it was no good.
She was still afraid. And just as a well-meaning German was afraid in
1933, I am also very much afraid. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CAROL ANN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Carol Ann.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Excuse me, before you begin, did we
get documentation of Mr. Johnson's notes? You may go ahead.]{.font4}

[CAROL ANN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am speaking as a resident of Minneapolis.
I have lived in Minneapolis for approximately twenty-eight years and
about twenty of those have been within a six-block radius of the Lake
Street area. I am presently living in the Chicago/Lake area, less than a
half a block from the Rialto Theater and the bookstore.]{.font4}

[As a child, when I was growing up, I experienced some good things on
Lake Street. I don't know if anybody can remember. I used to go
roller-skating on Dupont and Lake, movies at the American and Vogue---I
am just shaking---theaters at Lyndale and Lake, and the hobby shop and
pet shop at Bryant and Lake.]{.font4}

[Also in my past, I was raped by my father for over a year from six to
seven years old, and I witnessed the beatings of my mother through my
entire childhood, through my teenage years. Also I saw the pornography
literature---paperback books, black and white magazines---in my father's
bedroom through the entire time of my childhood and into my teenage
years until I left. I didn't know that that sexual abuse and physical
abuse was wrong. I found that out about two and a half years ago, and I
have been working on it ever since. The only thing that I did know, or
that I felt, was that it was my fault. My struggle to stay alive is my
process which I call reclaiming myself, not living out the
shame.]{.font4}

[Daily when I walk out of my house, and I would see the doors open as
usual and business as usual at the Rialto Theater and the bookstore, and
I go into the Marlin Gas Station to get bus change, and in front of me
displayed in]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4} [magazine, "Hustler Rejects, "
depicting a naked woman stuffed into a garbage can, legs hanging out and
dismembered body parts stuffed behind her. What I see is that women's
bodies are rejected, it is okay to be dismembered, and they belong in a
garbage can. It says to me that physical and sexual violence is okay,
acceptable, in demand, and paid for. That the rape of a six-year old
girl is okay and acceptable. I also see pornography as relying on mass
production and marketing. And I see its main motive as providing sensory
stimulation and gratification through extreme sexual violence,
mutilation, and finally death of women and children's bodies.]{.font4}

[This incident of my rape is but a part of the entire oppression. In the
midst of this social decay that confronts each of us here, I believe
there is a strong resistance growing. No longer do I need to seek
recognition through the rape of my body, but that I rid myself of the
fear that silences me to repossess myself. What is deadly to me is the
masses which rely on this form of violent visual expression to base
their daily interaction with me as a woman.]{.font4}

[And I publicly protest the pornography in my neighborhood and the
Chicago/Lake area. And I am glad that I am able to speak here, and I
support this ordinance. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is Joan Gilbertson in here?]{.font4}

[JOAN GILBERTSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Joan Gilbertson. I live at
\[address deleted\] in close proximity to the Chicago/Lake district. I
am here to say, for the Powderhorn Park Association, \[of\] which I am a
member, supports this ordinance wholeheartedly. We encourage you to pass
this ordinance. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Due to the snow, there was
someone that was late.]{.font4}

[KATHLEEN McKAY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Kathleen McKay. I am a
licensed psychologist in the State of Minnesota and I am Administrator
of Sagaris, a Mental Health Center for women located in South
Minneapolis, for nine and a half years.]{.font4}

[I am speaking from my experience and that of my colleagues,
psychologists and psychiatrists. We see women who voluntarily seek
assistance for life's problems, relationships, parenting, career issues,
and so on, and they range in age generally from 23 to 63.]{.font4}

[I can say without exaggeration that every woman we have seen over the
last nine and a half years has sustained damage living in a milieu which
systematically presumes and teaches that women's bodies are available
for the titillation of the public. The degradation and shame spoken
about by Linda Marchiano is something all women know about: catcalls on
the street, topless girls on & marquee, rapes, rapes and more rapes.
Part of what I do with women in therapy must be to teach them how to
compensate for this, how to live in an oppressive punishing culture that
does not teach, and barely allows, women to take pride in their own
bodies and in themselves.]{.font4}

[United States Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, during the
abortion debates some time ago, wrote a brief piece relating to the
right of privacy, and I quote mostly from him. He talks about the
customary presumption in a free society and the freedom to walk, freedom
to stroll or even loaf without being harassed. Pornography is one of the
most powerful teaching aids in the socialization and training of both
girls and boys, and adult women and men. The consistent and persistent
presentation of women as victims is training in the notion that women
are available for use, abuse, degradation, shame, and disgust. My
guarantees and promises as a citizen of the United States and resident
of Minneapolis dictate that I should be able to walk or stroll in my
town, even Hennepin Avenue and designated Lake Street corners, without
having pornographic expressions screaming shame and humiliation at me.
This does offend my civil rights as they are promised to me.]{.font4}

[I want to express my appreciation and that of my colleagues at Sagaris
to Ms. MacKinnon and Dworkin for their drafting of this ordinance, once
again putting Minneapolis on the map as a first in progressive
legislation. Also our appreciation to Alderman Hoyt and Van White for
their understanding of the issue and sponsorship of this ordinance. I
urge, may I say plead with you, to seriously consider this ordinance and
get a workable law for Minneapolis. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Dick Marple?]{.font4}

[DICK MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am speaking as a citizen of
Minneapolis. I am not affiliated with any groups and wasn't a scheduled
speaker or anything like that. I have some problems with the ordinance.
I think a number of the points defining what pornography is are vague
and fail to distinguish between violent pornography, which I find
generally reprehensible, and general erotic expression which I find
enjoyable, and I think it is my right as a citizen of the United States.
Particularly the subheadings on the definition that I think are quite
vague are numbers one, five, six, and seven. I fail to see how a jury or
a judge would be able to determine "whether women are presented as
whores by nature. " I don't know what that means. It is a nice slogan. I
don't think it is a legally significant term.]{.font4}

[I think "women presented as sexual objects, " I think in any
professional encounter both, regardless of their gender, may be sexual
objects to each other, and I see that as a legitimate form of sexual
expression. I am unclear on number five. What is the "posture of sexual
submission, " if this has to do with the positioning of the bodies, \'or
who is involved? I think that is pretty vague. And I am not sure about
number six, which refers to women being reduced to these body parts. My
main concern with this is that in attempting to eliminate pornography,
\[in silencing\] pornography in Minneapolis, we may be stepping on
legitimate rights of expression and people's right to enjoy themselves
in a nonoffensive way. I am also appalled in a civil rights ordinance at
the sexist language. It says the sexuality of women. There is no mention
of children or men, and I don't believe that they should be relegated to
second-class citizenship.]{.font4}

[I would also like to say that \[if\] we have a civil rights ordinance
trying to discourage presenting women as whores by nature, then I
believe that men have a civil right not to be presented as rapists by
nature. And I have read books by feminists in which they apparently
describe men this way. And I believe that if you will not accept the
predecessor of this law, that men act out according to descriptions or
portrayals, then I question some of these writers who portray men as
rapists by nature. Perhaps they just assign them to silence, or telling
them, this is what you are, you might as well do it. I think that is
sick.]{.font4}

[I am a clerk at the Minneapolis Public Library. I do not speak for the
Public Library. I speak as a concerned employee. And the bottom half of
my sentence is that I don't see the distinctions between violent
pornography and erotic material. I believe that the library can be in
deep trouble if individuals are allowed to censor the material that is
in the library, which would include art books, romances which are
written by and for women, such instructive material as the Bible, lives
of saints, tracts and feminist matters.]{.font4}

[I am also concerned---I am concerned that there may be restrictions, at
least threatened lawsuits, against news agencies who may, depending on
your definition of the word graphic, when they describe a sex crime. The
possibility of someone thinking the civil rights were violated might
bring a lawsuit against a newspaper for reporting this. That defeats the
purpose. I might also point out that if this bill had been passed before
1969, we may never have known about My Lai Massacre in Vietnam, because
some of the photographs that we used to report this would have been
considered pornographic and unlawful under this ordinance.]{.font4}

[My concern with the subheading of section four, number one, which deals
directly with public libraries is, they have to determine open display
of pornography. We have heard a woman describe]{.font4} [Vogue]{.font4}
[magazine,]{.font4} [Harper\'s Bazaar]{.font4}[; as having pornographic
images in it. I don't believe the library has the funds to defend each
and every item they have.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, I am sorry for interrupting. I
would like to call your attention in the ordinance on the second page,
under the discrimination of trafficking in pornography, number one,
which says, "City, state and federally funded libraries or private and
public university and college libraries in which pornography is
available for study shall not be construed to be trafficking in
pornography but open display of pornography in said places is sex
discrimination."]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is open display circulating a copy of a book
that is on a shelf so someone can see the cover? That is not very clear
to me.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I wanted to make sure---]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have been stewing about it for five days. I
also question section seven which is on the back page of the ordinance
in which it refers to assault and battery due to pornography. Any
person, which I think should be used in the previous section in
pornography instead of women, who is assaulted or battered in a way that
is directly caused by specific pornography, has a claim, et cetera. If
you refer to an act as having been directly caused by a specific piece
of pornography, are you not absolving the perpetrator from
guilt?]{.font4}

[HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you move back?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you not absolving the perpetrator from
guilt as a result of pornography? You are denying this person free will,
and therefore I wonder if he can be \[prosecuted\]? I think the most
dangerous part of the ordinance---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am sorry, I really missed what you said
about assault and battery. What was the initial criticism?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I objected to the phrase "directly caused by
specific pornography," because to me it seems to remove
responsibility,]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That isn't what I meant. What I didn't
understand is---I will tell you what I seem to understand from what you
said before. That there was something wrong in saying "man, child or
transsexual"?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah. I was referring back to the section that
defines pornography. I think a "person" or "human being" would cover all
categories.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Obviously you are saying that, to you, it
would be an improvement to state that in that summary form, rather than
the specific categories of persons?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah, I think so. I think that would cover
everybody. And I think in the definition under the ordinance using the
word women---instead of people, or men, children, transsexual, anybody
else you want to include---seems discriminatory in a civil rights
ordinance. I think there should be as much concern against violence for
women and children and men as there is for women.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you aware, the reason there is a civil
rights ordinance is because it is women who have been, as a class,
placed in this subordination, second-class position, and that is why it
is a civil rights issue? That is why it says women so often. Children
are mentioned here and not mentioned elsewhere, because there are
already laws on the books about child pornography.]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. I appreciate that. I still think men
have the right also.]{.font4}

[My major concern---and I am ready to close---is that the basic rights
of expression in this country, I believe, are fundamental, and I think
that this ordinance prohibits more than it \[in\]tends to prohibit. And
I find it very difficult to accept that a writer or an artist can be
prohibited from expressing himself or herself. I might add that books,
organized opinions that are done with the intention of putting out
abuses and injustices, would likewise be prohibited by this ordinance.
And also I question if this ordinance were passed and lawsuits were
taking place, whether other groups might not say that they have civil
rights that are being violated by other things, such as I have an
87-year-old grandmother who is very religious and who I am sure thinks
it is a crime against nature just even thinking about two women having
sex together. And I wonder if she would have walked by the Amazon
Bookstore or any place else, if her civil rights would not be
violated.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is that all you have?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is all.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you.]{.font4}

[HYATT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you an attorney in a lawsuit?]{.font4}

[MARPLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No, I am not. I am a law clerk at the
library.]{.font4}

[JAN SPRING:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Hello. I am Jan Spring. I live at
\[address deleted\], which is half a block away from the nearest
pornography theater. And, I have to say, I feel particularly privileged
to speak following Mr. Marple. He addressed several of the items that I
would like to address. Particularly the question of free speech and so
forth which has always been brought up whenever feminists raised
questions about pornography.]{.font4}

[I believe that in this ordinance, for the first time, we have a way of
dealing with pornography which doesn't get us into that problem. Up
until this time, sexually explicit and abusive materials were dealt with
in terms of obscenity. What obscenity means to me is that sex is dirty,
that my body is dirty because it is associated with sex, and that I
should be ashamed, and that any place, any bookstore or other thing that
displays women's bodies or, you know, deals in sex at all, should be
relegated to certain neighborhoods which are undesirable, such as my
neighborhood, or such as neighborhoods in which poor men and women live,
or in such neighborhoods \[in\] which people of color live.]{.font4}

[In this ordinance, a distinction between simply sexual or erotic
materials \[is\] not addressed by the ordinance and therefore, not
prohibited, and materials which are designed to harm women to keep us in
a state of submission, to keep us afraid---that latter group of
materials is prohibited, and it doesn't depend on the neighborhood. The
neighborhood I live in has been apparently for a long time considered a
neighborhood where pornography is permitted. That does not go by zoning,
and does not go by neighborhoods, and it is important that it not be
permitted in somebody else's neighborhood.]{.font4}

[Now I am speaking as a private citizen, although I have worked with
sexually assaulted and battered women and I am a therapist. I have lived
in Minneapolis for about four and a half years, and I have chosen to
live in the Powderhorn neighborhood all that time, which means that for
four and a half years, not every day but many days, I have stood on the
bus corner in front of whatever happened to be the local closest porn
shop, waiting for a bus. And I would walk by it on my way home, so that
I am not able to forget about the existence of pornography.]{.font4}

[Currently, I have two daughters, and when they want to walk to the
drugstore or to the grocery store---both of which are in walking
distance and easy for them to get to---they walk by the Avalon Theater.
They probably walk by that theater once or twice a day. I wonder what it
does to their minds. I don't know. I spoke to my daughter. I called her
to wish her a happy birthday, and I asked her if anything had ever
happened there. She said no, nothing particularly had ever happened
there. But I worry about my daughters because they have to go by this
place.]{.font4}

[I worry about them when they have to go out to play with the other kids
in the neighborhood, because most of the kids in the neighborhood are
boys, and they are subject to the influence of pornography, which says
to them that women and girls are objects and less than human, and
because those boys have demonstrated that, because I don't live with a
man, they think that my particular house is an okay house to vandalize,
and my guests are okay to harass, and that it is okay for them to come
and break into my house just for fun to scare my daughters. This
happened. It is on the police report. And, you know:, when I spoke to
the parents about it, that is what the boys said: it was just for
fun.]{.font4}

[So what porn means to me, is that I can't forget that---what society
thinks of me---which is that I am an object. I am a sex object. I am not
a human being. If I ever get raped walking down a street, it will be my
fault because I was alone.]{.font4}

[My daughters are growing up in a society which demeans them as less
than human. Their father has pornography in his home. I discovered it
and was very shocked, and I was very afraid, and I can't do anything
about it except to be afraid and wait and watch. And so, for me,
listening to the stories that I heard earlier this evening, I felt very
privileged, because I haven't been raped by anybody since I was a kid,
you know. I haven't been raped silently by a stranger. My daughters have
not been raped, and I hope they will not be. I have taken them to a
self-defense class.]{.font4}

[Yet, this is the kind of effect that pornography has on me. That I am
constantly informed that it is okay to beat women, and it is okay to
rape women, and women like being subjected to violence. And every time I
step outside of my door, and every time I stay inside my house, I know
that I may be the victim of violence against me, whether it be an
obscene phone call or physical attack. And all I have to say applies not
only to that porn which depicts violent acts. I feel the same about
pornography which merely shows women's genitals without the rest of
their bodies. I have not seen anything depicting men's genitals with the
rest of their bodies missing. Thank you.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. Next we have William Prock, 818
Southeast Seventh Street.]{.font4}

[WILLIAM PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is correct. I am employed by the
city of Minneapolis. I am the investigation manager for the Minneapolis
Department of Civil Rights. I am not presenting a series of comments or
position statements for the Department. I am aware that our Executive
Director, ]{.font4}[George Caldwell, has certain questions and certain
disagreements with me. I am aware that other people on our staff have
other concerns, other questions, and we may or may not be in
agreement.]{.sgc-2}

[What I would like to present is not to talk about sexual abuse,
pornography per se. I would like to talk about the proposal before the
Commission in the context of the civil rights statutes and in particular
in relationship to the Minneapolis civil rights ordinance. Some of these
concerns were heard yesterday, and I anticipate a good session tomorrow
afternoon, when I understand we are making a presentation to the
Department.]{.font4}

[The nation and the City of Minneapolis have a long history of concern
for the rights of their citizens. These rights are embodied in the
Constitution of the United States and the fifty states themselves\'.
Unfortunately, we do not have the same history in ensuring that all
citizens receive the opportunity to exercise those constitutionally
guaranteed rights.]{.font4}

[These constitutionally guaranteed rights are inherent in us as human
citizens of the United States. As such, they are moral imperatives to
all persons within the country. The concept of human rights is a moral,
ethical, and some would say religious concept. However, human rights and
civil rights are not one and the same. While human rights carry a moral
imperative, civil rights are those ensured by statute, statutes enacted
in a limited fashion, to render real concepts embodied in the
Constitution. Statutory civil rights, particularly those which resulted
from the struggle exemplified by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., were
enacted to provide a means of redress for the denial of rights embodied
in the statutes themselves. These rights all dealt with some aspect of
life, the denial of which could produce some identifiable and concrete
personal loss to the individual, such as denial of a job, housing, the
inability to obtain credit, inability to purchase a meal in a place of
one's choice, inability to attend a movie theater, use a washroom, ride
a bus, obtain an education and a myriad of other concrete
harms.]{.font4}

[Thus, civil rights statutes have in common the need to identify a
specific identifiable and compensable harm to the individual in order to
be able \[to\] invoke their protections. Further, each statute requires
that a person claiming to be aggrieved be a member of a specifically
identified protected class, race, sex, color, affectional preference, et
cetera. It is my opinion that the City of Minneapolis has one of the
best-drafted and comprehensive civil rights statutes in the
country.]{.font4}

[However, under the proposal before the Committee today, the concept of
protected class is turned on its ear. We are no longer looking at a
status characteristic of an individual in order to obtain access to the
laws' protection. Rather, we are dealing with an individual's behavior,
the behavior of some other individual, or a graphic representation of
behavior as the definitional basis for a new protected class. While this
may be legitimate, it is a new and untried legal approach and deserves,
at minimum, the due deliberation given to all previous substantive
amendments to the ordinance. I cite in particular the deliberation and
time spent by City Council on those amendments that added affectional
preference as a protected class in 1982 and permitted families with
children to bring actions to the Civil Rights Department in the area of
housing discrimination.]{.font4}

[There are some specific concerns I have that result not in objections
to the ordinance per se, but as questions that I think the Council
should consider in its deliberations. And I will do these by section.
Section 2 (b)(1), this section provides that \[victims of\] pornography
is another protected class, upon which a claim of employment, housing,
and other forms of discrimination can be brought. And as such I
believe---]{.font4} 

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Just a minute, what page are you
on?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [This is the first page, Section 2
(b)(1).]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Go ahead.]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [This section, I believe, adds little or nothing
in the way of further protection for women that already exists in the
ordinance.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Prock, is sexual harassment a status
characteristic?]{.font4} 

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No, it is not.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It is there.]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It is a behavior that is directed---it is an
obnoxious behavior. I understand that the pornography section is a
theoretical extension of sexual harassment theory, as interpreted
through Title VII and through the courts. Sexual harassment itself as
under Section 7 is gender-free.]{.font4}

[Okay. I don't want to debate, because what I would like to do is raise
the concerns and the Council will deal with them. Some of them, I
believe, will have policy implications for the Council.]{.font4}

[Section 3 (gg), pornography is so defined that a judgment of what is
within that definition is either extremely broad and very easy, or
extremely difficult, meaning that it is very narrow, with the potential
for page by page and paragraph by paragraph analysis being required, and
to the extreme requiring a percentage content rule to determine the
inclusion or exclusion. This places a tremendous burden with the
individuals charged with making those judgments. I believe in most
cases]{.font4} [the]{.font4} [people making the judgments would be my
staff in the Civil Rights Department. This is a burden that the City
Council would not want to give to anyone without the proper legal
counseling and background.]{.font4}

[Section 4 (1), this defines what consists of trafficking in
pornography. Prosecution under this section does not, as it is currently
written and I interpret it, require any individual to come forward
alleging concrete, identifiable and compensable harm under the law, as
civil rights statutes have been construed. The mere fact of production,
regardless of the circumstances of that production, becomes a cause of
action. The same would hold true for the sale, exhibition, or
distribution. No one need come forward and allege personal harm. This
seems nothing more than an open attempt at ultimate censorship.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [May I ask a question here?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, ma'am.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What we are trying to say is that the existence
of the material as described here is the harm.]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I understand.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you understand that?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I understand that. I think the implication
is that, as I read it, it is a risk. I am not saying that this is gospel
in any way. As I read it, the risk is that the mere sale, display, et
cetera, would constitute a violation and would allow possibly the City
Attorney's Office, my director, myself, any of my staff people
essentially file the charge on sale, out it goes.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is right.]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am not sure that that will stand up.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Doesn't that make your job easier?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Unfortunately, it might make it much more
difficult. I think it might make it much more difficult. I don't know.
These are concerns that I have.]{.font4}

[I do believe, however, that the theory embodied in this particular
section---and that is a body of literature and pictures or whatever,
that deliberately and purposefully and with malice degrades and places
into second-class citizenship a segment of our society---\[that\] this
is a rather dangerous theory. Under this theory, it could be extended to
the production, distribution, sale, or exhibition of literature produced
by, in some cases, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith,
because it could in times degrade and put in second-class status
non-Jewish citizens. Or it could be extended to permit the banning of
publications for the National States Rights Party by directly and
purposefully being aimed at perpetuating the second-class citizens of
all racial minorities, particularly black people. This is one of J. B.
Stoner's publications. It could be interpreted to ban, should the theory
hold, publications of the Black Panther Party, if it ever comes back
into the forefront, which are at times very degrading to whites. In
other instances it could in fact be extended to ban some of the
publications of the American Civil Liberties Union, which in most cases
do not reflect the opinions of the majority of Americans.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you tell me where in here that the
material has to reflect the opinion of the majority of the
Americans?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am not saying it is.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It was under my impression that the definition
of pornography did not refer to the opinion of the majority of
Americans.]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That is correct. What I am trying to point
out---]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You seem to be going down a track that was not
directed at what was written in this ordinance. Are you saying this
ordinance, you fear the passage of this ordinance would bring people to
want to pass other---]{.font4} 

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think that is a risk that is inherent in the
theory that is embodied in the trafficking section. While these last may
seem farfetched and impossible, the theory underlying the trafficking
provision is the basis for such outlandish possibilities.]{.font4}

[Within the governmental library exemption is a puzzling inconsistency.
It is assumed that when pornography is sold over the counter, controlled
or free, it is being purveyed and purchased for less than noble
purposes. However, when it is lent by or used within a public library,
it is for research purposes, and the damage it commits upon its reader
somehow seems to miraculously disappear. If pornography is damaging and
dangerous, it is so whether obtained from a magazine rack or a public
library.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [If we eliminated that section, what would
you then say?]{.font4} 

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I don't know. I would have to take a look at
that in context with the rest of this. Further, the open display of
pornography is defined as sex discrimination when the library does the
displaying, thus making the libraries subject to suits by citizens of
the City of Minneapolis, alleging sex discrimination, not trafficking,
but invoking pain and suffering and punitive damages and other
compensative awards for damages.]{.font4}

[Section 5 (m)(l), this provides for a five-year statute of limitations
in the bringing of a discrimination suit under this proposal. This is
more closely allied to statutes of limitation for criminal actions. The
remainder of the prohibited acts in the existing ordinance require
action to be brought within six months. Is it proper to single out one
form of discrimination, within a single statute, as being deserving
\[of\] a longer statute of limitations than all others? I merely offer
this for Council's consideration, as all other forms of prohibited
discrimination are considered equally bad under the law.]{.font4}

[Finally, I must say I have other reservations about this statute,
particularly with Section 7 (o) which grants the Civil Rights Department
investigative authority over acts of discrimination that are part and
parcel of criminal activity. Currently, the existing ordinance, under
Section 141. 90, prohibits the Department from issuing a complaint or
hearing any matter when the alleged discrimination is part of or arises
out of an incident or occurrence which in itself could give rise to a
criminal prosecution for the violation of any state statute other than
the state act against discrimination.]{.font4}

[As Aldermen White and Daugherty and Howard are aware, the repeal of
this provision occupied much time for the Council and the Civil Rights
Commission for several years. Ultimately, it was deemed by the Council
that the exemption should remain in the ordinance. My question is now,
has the Council changed its mind and does it now desire the Civil Rights
Department to investigate discrimination that is entwined with criminal
activity, or does the Council desire to retain the prohibition that was
put in the ordinance at least ten years ago and reaffirmed in
1982?]{.font4}

[Ultimately, I fully support the effort for providing an
administrative--- at low or no cost---enforcement mechanism for women
who have suffered harm at the hands of pimps, pornographers, rapists,
and et cetera. Too often, I believe, women can't pursue legitimate
claims that would result in punishment of a person who used them as
sexual objects, solely because they are women, due to the prohibitive
costs of such actions. I only believe that the current proposal will not
achieve that end, and if carried forward without due diligence for legal
precedents and inconsistency with legal theory, it stands the risk of
taking the effort back beyond ground zero.]{.font4}

[I simply ask the Council to study this matter with the same
thoroughness it studied the original Minneapolis civil rights ordinance
and all the substantive amendments that have since been
enacted.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [May I ask one question? It is a real
question.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let's not---]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It is not a debating question.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Quickly, so we can get as many to
speak.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Prock, I certainly look forward to our
conversation time. I want to tell you that. I want to know what you
describe as the concrete harms, the harms that the civil rights law is
to address, and I would like you to say whether or not you consider the
loss of your right to your own body as a concrete harm?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Conceptually, yes. Legally, I don't
know.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And your life?]{.font4}

[PROCK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, it is covered under the civil rights
statute.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Those that are still remaining to
speak, I'm going to have to cut you down to just quickly. If you have
got something to submit, please submit it so that we can get out of here
at 9: 00 o'clock.]{.font4}

[How many of you are still left here? Okay. You go, please.]{.font4}

[TRINA PORTE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Trina Porte \[address
deleted\].]{.font4}

[I have not yet been raped. At least, I have not been physically forced
to have sex with men, which is not to say I have not been emotionally
and psychologically coerced into having sex with men. I have. But that
is not why I am speaking now.]{.font4}

[I am speaking as someone who carefully listened to the testimony all
yesterday afternoon and evening and I was astonished by all the people,
who were mostly men, who said that they object to this ordinance because
it might actually do something. Because it might affect some examples of
pornography, as here very specifically defined. They felt that we should
be satisfied with laws as they now exist. Laws written by and for men's
use, for the protection of their speech, actions, and/or
livelihood.]{.font4}

[Yes, this ordinance might actually allow people to do something to
address---and maybe provide a means of redress for---some of the
unending violence done to women, children, and anyone else who has a
case, as defined very specifically in this ordinance.]{.font4}

[That is why this ordinance needs to be passed: because it might just
possibly do something to alleviate some of the violence that each and
every woman must live with, every day of her life, just because she was
born a woman.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I want to thank all of you.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Chairman White?]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Alderman Hoyt?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to put one more thing in our
records that I asked to be brought. As you know, we have in our Crime
Prevention Department the ability to get sites, specific locations. And
just one day I gave them the addresses of the bookstores that traffic in
pornography, and the movie houses in Minneapolis, some of them. And I
asked them to run a site, specifically within one mile, since last June,
of the number of instances that we have had crimes that have occurred
around those locations.]{.font4}

[I also fed into it a location of a family movie theater which is 3800
42nd Avenue South, the Riverview Terrace. And we found that 424 Hennepin
and 624 Hennepin were so close that it was run as 500 Hennepin Avenue
and there were 566 crimes; 1111 Hennepin Avenue, there were 694;
Franklin and 10th Avenue, within one mile, there were 894; 401 East
Hennepin was 178; 2938 Lyndale Avenue South was 557; 409 West Broadway
was 365; 345 East Lake Street was 810; 1500 East Lake was 656; 741 East
Lake Street was 873. My momentary control---and we can run it on the
other theaters---of 3800 42nd Avenue South, was 69.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [These are criminal acts against
persons or---]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Against persons of assault, aggravated, simple
assault, rape, indecent exposure, the sex crimes as they are put into
our computers. And I would like to enter this on the record. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I have one final thing to put into evidence,
and it is a telegram from Gloria Steinem who says: "As someone who looks
to Minnesota for national leadership in social policy, I urge you to
amend Title VII by including pornography as a form of sex
discrimination. Your leadership is as historically important here as in
making clear that rape is violence, not sexual expression, or that
sexual harassment is a major form of sexual discrimination. " I will not
read the rest of the telegram, but I will enter this into evidence right
now. \[Exh. 28\] Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We are going to hear---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Karen Kurtz says she wishes to
testify.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [She wishes to testify. Please make it
brief.]{.font4}

[KAREN KURTZ:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Karen Kurtz. First of all, I
want to thank those Council members who are staying here and listening
to all of us. I appreciate the time you are putting in. I also want to
say that I think it is\... outrageous that more of the Council did not
consider these hearings a high enough priority to be here.]{.font4}

[Originally, I chose not to speak at this hearing, but to submit written
testimony instead. After last night's hearing, I've changed my mind for
two reasons. After some of the testimony, specifically that of the Civil
Rights Commissioner's, I'm fearful that this ordinance will be postponed
and then pushed aside. I don't want to be a part of the group that
throws up their hands and says there's nothing that can be done, or
we're already doing all we can.]{.font4}

[Something else occurred to me last night. I have been sexually abused
in one form or another since I was thirteen. I am now twenty-six. That's
half of my life, and that's too long for me.]{.font4}

[This statement that was originally submitted as written testimony is
addressed to the Government Operations Committee.]{.font4}

[I am writing to express my support for passage of the proposed
amendment to the civil rights ordinance recognizing pornography as sex
discrimination against women. I do believe there is a strong connection
between the use and existence of pornography and violence against women.
This belief comes not from scientific studies, but from my personal
experiences.]{.font4}

[As an adolescent, I was sexually molested in my own home by a family
member who regularly used pornographic materials. I have been threatened
at knifepoint by a stranger in an attempted rape. I have been physically
and verbally harassed on the street, in other public places, and over
the telephone at all hours of the night. I have experienced and continue
to experience the humiliation, degradation, and shame that these acts
were meant to instill in me.]{.font4}

[I believe that the only difference between my experiences and
pornography was the absence or presence of a camera. This connection
became clear to me when I saw a documentary about pornography
called]{.font4} [Not a Love Story.]{.font4} [I realized that I was any
one of the women in the film, at least in the eyes of those men who have
abused me. I saw myself through the abusers' eyes and I felt dirty and
disgusting, like a piece of meat. It was the same shame and humiliation
as in the other experiences. It didn't matter that it was only a
movie.]{.font4}

[The message that pornography carries is clear to me. There is no place
in our society where it is safe to be a woman---not in our homes, not in
the streets, not even within our families. Pornography promotes and
creates the conditions that make it dangerous to be a woman.]{.font4}

[I don't believe that it has to be this way. I hope this committee will
strongly support these proposed amendments. Recognizing pornography as
sex discrimination against women is the first step in some day making it
safe to be a woman in our society. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to thank all of you who
also sat through and listened. It has been quite an experience. I have
had quite a few experiences in my life that I will never forget. I have
been here some time on this earth. This is one of those experiences that
will live with me until I shuffle off.^14^ I want to thank you once
again for coming out, and we will do whatever we can possibly do, those
of us that are here. This is part of the Committee.]{.font4}

[And for those of you who don't know, Councilmember Sally Howard had to
leave and Councilmember Charlee Hoyt is here at my right, and at my
extreme right is Councilmember Daugherty, Pat Daugherty. Hopefully
together we can gather enough votes to get it through the Council. We
are not going to promise you except one thing---and I think I am
speaking for all of us---that we will do our very, very best to get this
ordinance through this Council. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, may we move this ordinance for a
special meeting on Thursday for discussion and Committee as to the
action, tomorrow?]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You make that a motion.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to move that.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thursday morning. Time?]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [9: 00, 9: 30.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [9: 15.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So that the reason we will move it to a special
meeting at 9: 15 on Thursday, so that there will be an opportunity for
the Civil Rights Commission to have a chance to talk with and give us
their suggestions. We would like to ask if our consultants can be
present at our meeting on Thursday, and any other alderman that wants to
come.]{.font4}

[DAUGHERTY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think we should ask the City Attorney
also.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Allen Hyatt also.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [On the motion, the motion is to
move---]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [To move the ordinance to a special meeting
Thursday at 9: 15.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [9: 15. All in favor say aye.]{.font4}

[COMMITTEE MEMBERS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Aye.]{.font4}

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Opposed?]{.font4}

[(No response. )]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would appreciate a statement from you on
the record that everyone that signed up and who requested to speak at
this hearing was allowed to speak. And that the hearings were brought to
a close at a point at which no person indicated they further wished to
speak.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRMAN WHITE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let the record so show.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Chairman.]{.font4}

[HOYT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would also like to say I appreciate the fact
that the consultants which the City Attorney's Office hired to construct
and put together a public hearing which would give us the legal base we
needed, and allowed the input from all sectors of Minneapolis, have done
so. And I would like to publicly thank them and the City Attorney's
Office and A1 Hyatt who has worked very hard to bring us this far. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[Analysis and Comments:]{.font4}

[There were no emotional reactions indicative of deception to the above
pertinent test questions and it is my professional OPINION that
Subject's answers to the above questions were truthful.]{.font4}

[Phase III]{.font4}

[During the pre-test interview and while in the process of formulating
the questions to be asked on the polygraph for this phase, Subject broke
down and cried.]{.font4}

[After a rest period the interview continued and the activities of Linda
were discussed. After gaining her composure the following pertinent test
questions were asked while she was attached to the polygraph.]{.font4}

[Polygraph Test]{.font4}

[QUESTION:     ANSWER:]{.font3}

[4. DID BOB WOLF DIRECT YOU IN A MOVIE WHERE YOU HAD SEX WITH A DOG?    
                YES]{.font3}

[6. DID HUGH HEFNER WANT TO SEE YOU HAVE SEX WITH CHUCK'S DOG NAMED
"RUFUS"?                ]{.font3}[ ]{.sgc-7}[YES]{.sgc-7}

[8. DID YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TWO DOGS?    
  ]{.font3}[ ]{.sgc-7}[YES]{.sgc-7}

[Analysis and Comments:]{.font4}

[This was a Silent Answer Test where Subject was instructed to answer to
herself.]{.font4}

[There were no emotional reactions indicative to deception to questions
\#6 and \#8.]{.font4}

[When Subject was asked during the first run of the Silent Answer Test
\#4 "DID BOB WOLF DIRECT YOU IN A MOVIE WHERE YOU HAD SEX WITH A DOG? "
there were highly emotional reactions following that question
specifically a blood pressure rise, sweat gland activity and in the
breathing patterns.]{.font4}

[During the asking of that question (\#4) with verbal response by Linda
Lovelace a second time, there were strong reactions in both
pneumographic reading tracings and a violent and dramatic blood pressure
rise to that question. Subject was crying and holding back
tears.]{.font4}

[It is my professional OPINION that Subject was answering truthful to
questions \#6 and \#8. Because of the violent and dramatic reaction to
question \#4 which was followed by Subject crying, no opinion could be
given.]{.font4}

[However, writer is convinced that Subject was not attempting deception.
Since she broke down and cried writer did not deem it proper or wise to
re-examine her further on the polygraph. This phase terminated at 2:
30]{.font4} [p. m.]{.font3}

[Interrogation Phase]{.font4}

[After a short rest period the interview continued without Miss Lovelace
being attached to the polygraph. This time the questions supplied by
Mike McGrady and the publisher were reviewed. All the questions outlined
in that question sheet were asked of Linda Lovelace.]{.font4}

[The only area where Subject had any problem was with a question which
dealt with whether or not Chuck Traynor ever had sex, oral or otherwise,
with Altovise Davis. Subject stated she wasn't sure since she did not
see them.]{.font4}

[During this phase of the questioning Subject again broke down and cried
and after a short rest period the interrogation recommenced. ]{.font4}

[Analysis and Comments:]{.font4}

[Based upon the information supplied, the galleys of "ORDEAL" with Mike
McGrady, Citadel Press, Secaucus, N. J., the pre-Polygraph test]{.font4}

[interviews prior to each phase of each test, the analysis of the
emotional reactions on the polygraph to the above critical questions and
post-test conversation and interrogation of Subject, it is my
professional OPINION that Subject's answers to the above critical
questions were truthful.]{.font4}

[The question "DID BOB WOLF DIRECT YOU IN A MOVIE WHERE YOU HAD SEX WITH
A DOG? " aroused violent and dramatic reactions. Therefore, no opinion
could be given and writer did not desire to put her through another
ordeal.]{.font4}

L. Barry, Ph. D., sociologist, Brandeis University, November 15,
1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[In this memo I intend to identify the practices related to pornography
which constitute a violation of woman's civil rights, and in accordance
with the International Declaration of Human Rights, they constitute a
violation of woman's human rights. As I have already conducted, reported
and published the research which documents these practices as slavery
(see]{.font4} [Female Sexual Slavery,]{.font4} [Prentice-Hall, 1979) and
in view of the United Nations report of March 1983 of a survey conducted
by Jean Fernand-Laurent for the Economic and Social Council which has
reached similar conclusions, I shall not provide the supporting
documentation here as it can be found in those works. As a result of my
research I have found that]{.font4}

[(1) Pornography is used by pimps as a part of the illegal \[act\] of
procuring and attempting to induce young girls and women into
prostitution. By presenting young women and girls with pornography which
fraudulently represents actually painful sexual practices and acts as
pleasing and gratifying to the female represented in the pornography,
the pimp attempts to convince young and vulnerable (usually homeless)
young women to prostitute themselves for him. Pornography plays a large
role in the deception that is necessary to put naive young women into
prostitution.]{.font4}

[(2)    When a young girl or woman is procured, pornography is often
used as part of the seasoning and blackmail strategies which will force
her into prostitution. Prior to being "turned out" to prostitution, many
pimps "season" or break down their victims through sessions of rape and
other forms of sexual abuse. Sometimes these sessions are photographed
or filmed and used in a variety of ways which include personal pleasure
of the pimp and his friends, blackmailing the victim by threatening to
send them to her family, and selling them to pornographers for mass
production. This constitutes the use of pornography as a form of torture
and the marketing of actual torture sessions in the form of film and
pictures as a pleasure commodity.]{.font4}

[(3)    Pornography is a form of prostitution and consequently
pornographers are pimps. There have been several court cases upholding
the convictions of pornographers as pimps for having been supported off
the earnings of prostitutes. My research has supported these legal
findings to the extent that those who traffic women (and children, boys
and girls) into prostitution also traffic them into pornography. It is a
myth to assume that the "porn star" is someone other than a woman in
prostitution and one who is most likely under the control of pimps who
are either the pornographers or who contract their prostitute's
"services" to the pornographers for a price. Consequently pornography
performance is only one of the acts of prostitution required of the
women involved in it.]{.font4}

[I have kept my observations here within the limits of my empirical
research. Obviously the use of pornography as a violation of woman's
civil rights extends far beyond this which I have also written and
commented on elsewhere.]{.font4}

[]{#minnExhibits.xhtml#bookmark5}[Exhibit 5 \[13\]: Letter of Flora
Colao, C. S. W., November 10, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[I have been working with sexual assault survivors since 1975. I am
founder of the St. Vincent's Hospital Rape Crisis Program in New York
City, a member of New York Women Against Rape and Co-Director of the
Childrens Creative Safety Program at the Safety and Fitness Exchange
(SAFE Inc. ) in New York City. I am writing to offer evidence, based on
case histories of individuals and families I have worked with, as to how
pornography directly affects the sexual victimization of women and
children.]{.font4}

[1.     The use of cameras in rapes:]{.font4}

[An increasing number of women I have counseled have reported to me that
while they were being attacked by one man, they were filmed and/or
photographed by another. In two incidents the women were told, "We can
make real money if we kill you because then it will be a 'snuff' film. "
In other incidents the women were shown the Polaroid pictures and asked,
"Do you want to report this? They'll have to show these pictures to
everybody if you do, the police, lawyers, judge and jury will see them.
" Many of these women were too frightened to report these incidents to
the police. Of the women I am still in contact with, several have stated
that each time they think about the pictures, they wonder if they were
sold. They continue to suffer chronic fear and anxiety.]{.font4}

[2.     The increased number of throat rapes:]{.font4}

[I have been alarmed by the increasing numbers of women and gay men who
have reported to me that they have been throat raped. In one such
incident the woman reported hearing one of her attackers state, "I'll
'Deep throat' her" before losing consciousness. Gay men have reported
similar assaults. It is important to note, however, that although we
know about most of the murders that include sexual assaults, we don't
know how many were caused by the victims suffocating during a throat
rape.]{.font4}

[3.     The use of adult pornography to coerce children into sexually
abusive relationships:]{.font4}

[In this type of situation, a child is shown adult pornography, asked if
s/he is allowed by parents to view such materials and then sexually
assaulted. The child is then told that if s/he tells, the offender will
tell that s/he looked at the materials. In the case cited in my book
(pg. 38,]{.font4} [Your Children Should Know]{.font4} [by Flora Colao
and Tamar Mosansky, © 1983 Bobbs Merrill Co., Inc. ) after one child
disclosed, twenty-two came forward including that child's younger
sister. I have worked with increasing numbers of children both male and
female who were coerced in this way.]{.font4}

[]{#minnExhibits2.xhtml#bookmark6}[Exhibit 7 \[21\]: Letter of Michelle
Harrison, M. D., December 9, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[This letter is in reference to concerns expressed regarding the use and
effect of pornography within the medical community. I am a family
physician with training in both psychiatry and obstetrics and
gynecology, and the author of]{.font4} [A Woman in Residence]{.font4}
[(Random House 1982, Penguin 1983), and]{.font4} [Self-Help for
Premenstrual Syndrome]{.font4} [(Matrix 1982). My CV is
attached.]{.font4}

[The pornographic view of women is one that is prevalent within the
medical community unfortunately. This is expressed by the kinds of jokes
that are made about women and their bodies, especially when they are
under anesthesia and undergoing surgical procedures. This view includes
seeing women as not worthy of respect and also seeing them primarily in
terms of their sexual functioning.]{.font4}

[Several years ago when I was teaching at the Rutgers medical school
there was a week long sexuality program planned annually for students.
The first day of this program consisted of all-day viewing of
pornographic movies. The intent was to "de-sensitize" the students to
sex. What it did in effect was to communicate a view of sex as being
pornographic. For women in the audience, it was embarrassing and in some
ways humiliating to see other women portrayed as they were on the
screen.]{.font4}

[We have come a long way in how we allowed racial minorities to be
viewed and yet this awareness and consciousness has not spread to how
women are treated in media. We are long past the time when we expect a
roomful of Black people to sit and watch movies of Black people being
presented in any of the stereotypic ways that degrade them. We also do
not consider that viewing such films would be useful to anyone in
understanding rights of these people but would rather assume the
contrary. There is no doubt that violence in imagery promotes violence
toward people and there cannot be any doubt that a pornographic view of
women promotes that view as a general way of seeing women.]{.font4}

[I commend the Minneapolis City Council even for considering this issue
and sincerely hope that your decisions will be those that add to the
civil rights due to women.]{.font4}

[]{#minnExhibits2.xhtml#bookmark7}[Exhibit 8 \[31\]: Letter of Robin
Morgan, December 5, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[The City Council Minneapolis, Minnesota]{.font4}

[Dear People:]{.font4}

[This is written in support of the proposed legislation before the
Council which would include pornography as a practice discriminatory
against and degrading/endangering to the civil rights of female citizens
of your city.]{.font4}

[In twenty years as a writer, activist, and lecturer on women's rights
in this country and internationally, I have heard literally numberless
testimonials from individual women and women's groups (in this country
and abroad) about the deleterious effects of pornography on their own
and other women's lives, both in the public and private realms.
Publicly, it is of course at best, degrading and at worst physically
sickening and endangering to be forced to purchase one's morning
newspaper from a kiosk, store, or stand where one is surrounded by
brutalizing and graphic depictions of female human beings; the
"man-on-the-street" comments which such displays both evoke and reflect
are a source of enormous anxiety to all women---ranging from the
adrenaline of distaste evoked in the woman-target all the way to the
adrenaline evoked by real fear of real action (street rape, harassment,
etc. ) often following up on the menacing comment. Privately, literally
hundreds of women have mentioned to me the anger and despair they feel
when their husbands, lovers, or other male partners press upon them
specific sexual acts which these men learned from pornographic
materials---acts of bestiality, sodomy, "swinging," forced group sex,
etc. The men feel such pressure on women is acceptable because
pornography is acceptable, and pornography was the so-called
"educational" source.]{.font4}

[I assume you already are in possession of and/or will hear testimony
about the recent bias-free studies which]{.font4} [do]{.font4} [in fact
show that there are causal effects between the proliferation of
pornography and the rising tide of violence against women in this
country. The experiments and studies done by Dr. Edward Donnerstein (U.
of Wise. ), and Drs. Check and Malamud]{.font4} [\[sic\]]{.font4}
[(Winnipeg) utterly refute the "porn as a harmless outlet for sexual
aggression" theory promulgated by pornographers. In addition, the work
of Dr. Natalie Shainess (psychiatrist of New York) and Dr. Frank Osanka
\[sic\] (psychologist and child-abuse specialist, Chicago) show that
convicted rapists who, even five to seven years ago, expressed remorse
about their acts of violence, recently show no such remorse and often
cite as a reason for guiltlessness that "everyone knows women want to be
raped; all the porn stuff proves that. " Furthermore, Dr. Richard
Gelles, probably the nation's foremost expert on domestic violence, has
written and spoken publicly on the correlations which exist
between]{.font4} [pornography,]{.font3 .sgc-1} [abusive sexual demands
made on women in the home, and domestic violence against both women and
children. Dr. Gelles, based at the University of Rhode Island, has
written many scholarly books on the subject of family violence and has
been a government advisor on the subject.]{.font4}

[I would remind the Council, as well, that stacks of pornographic books,
magazines, and other such material were found in the commune of Charles
Manson and in the apartment of Richard Berkowitz, the notorious "Son of
Sam" convicted murderer; both men targeted women as their special
victims.]{.font4}

[Perhaps it is academic to add that pornography is demeaning to male
sexuality as well as to female; it trains young males and encourages in
older males the worst attitudes about sexuality in general and about
female human beings in particular; it ill prepares men for encountering
genuine female sexuality, or even for encountering aggression-free,
mutually satisfying, affectionate relationships at all. Even so, this
severe damage done to male citizens still is not comparable to the
disastrous effects pornography has on female citizens---it literally
endangers women's "lives, liberties, and sacred honor" as
Constitutionally protected citizens.]{.font4}

[As a writer, I am extremely concerned about the proper defense of civil
liberties and freedom of the press. This issue, in particular as it
comes before your distinguished Council, fortunately endangers and
infringes on none of those rights to publish, print, etc. On the
contrary, your vitally important decision to act on behalf of female
citizens and children---as well as on behalf of a humane male vision of
sexuality---would protect and defend citizens' civil liberties, freedom
of movement, and safety of environment both at home and in public
areas.]{.font4}

[The most recent and most responsible scientific findings and evidence
urge your passing of this Code of Ordinances Amendment. The Constitution
of the United States in its stated protection of the rights of citizens
urges your passing this Amendment. Women, not only in Minneapolis but in
the country at large, urge your passing of this Amendment, for our sake,
for the sake of our men and of our children, and for the sake of a sane
vision of humane and amicable, tender, and healthy sexuality in our
culture, free from the propaganda of violence and degradation.]{.font4}

[Let me add my own individual voice to this chorus: I urge the passage
of the Amendment, and congratulate you on considering passage, and on
having hearings to deliberate the matter. I look forward to what I
deeply hope will be a courageous and just decision on behalf of truly
humane values and on behalf of the majority of this nation's
citizens---women.]{.font4}

Bauer]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[To Whom It May Concern:]{.font4}

[In 1971, I shot some]{.font4} [test]{.font4} [pictures for Dwight
Hooker that were submitted to Playboy. I was never paid for that
shooting nor do I remember signing a release for them.]{.font4}

[On the basis of those pictures they flew me into Chicago to shoot the
centerfold, but after 3 days, because of personal problems the
photographer was having, they sent me back to L.A. & put me on
hold---the session being incomplete. For those 3 days they paid me
\$750.00 holding fee. I was not to do any nude work not even cosmetic
commercials such as for soap where I would "appear" nude. After a year
of turning down other jobs they said, "Sorry, we don't care to use you
after all. "]{.font4}

[Exactly 10 years later after becoming a "star" or "celebrity" or
"name," they published one of the]{.font4} [test]{.font4} [pictures of
me in the Jan. 1981 issue along with about 8 other stars.]{.font4}

[One of the other women ran into the hairdressing room wanting to show
off her picture & asked if I had seen mine yet. I told her I didn't know
what she was talking about. She then showed me my picture completely
nude & hers & the other stars who were only partially nude. They had
just shot theirs 3 months before & of course had been paid for it.
Playboy never approached me & asked me to shoot with them they simply
pulled my picture from some old file. They also never paid me. (They
didn't use a picture from 3 day shoot. )]{.font4}

[The press went wild & I was judged not only by them but by my peers
& the public. If Playboy had asked me to do even the partially nude
pictures I would have refused. I'm a wife & the mother of 2 children
now, an actress not a model. The press was very critical & also very
interested. How could a Christian pose for a nude picture---how much was
I paid? I related my story & fortunately a couple of reporters checked.
Playboy wouldn't discuss it & one of them was even hung up on so my
story was confirmed.]{.font4} [Who would want to be judged 10 yrs later
for the mistakes they made in their early]{.font4} [20\'s? There was
another incident. Another photographer shot test pictures that were
submitted to "Oui. " Again I sign no release. They wanted me for a
layout on the basis of the test pictures, but at the same time I had got
my first contract for a show which made me a star. I didn't need the
money anymore so I turned them down. About 3 yrs ago the photographer
apparently sold my test pictures to Hustler Magazine. Again no release
& no payment.]{.font4}

[I was deeply embarrassed, but fortunately at the time I did nudes they
were simply beautiful pictures of women who were undressed. There was no
sexuality involved. No vampy half clothed or touching one's self,
pictures. In fact my nude career was over for that reason. I refused
when one photographer asked me to touch myself. Nude pictures were
changing.]{.font4}

[I have never sued or asked for payment for either publishing. I am
deeply religious now & about 6 yrs ago I put it all into the Lord's
hands. Scripture does not really support suing & payment would have been
giving my approval or agreement to something which was unjust, hurtful,
unethical & illegal, not to mention irresponsible.]{.font4}

[Please excuse this paper & long hand, but I'm at work & doing my best
to get this off to you before court convenes.]{.font4}

[I pray that I have been of help.]{.font4}

[Respectfully yours,]{.font4}

[Jaime Lyn Bauer]{.font4}

[P. S. I lost a couple of jobs because the producers & sponsors didn't
want that kind of girl on their shows. I was even canceled from a
charity benefit for crippled children. That hurt the most. I cannot
explain to everyone who knows, that they were shot 10 yrs ago. Many
people think I just did them. I also can't explain, I didn't do it to
show off my body or sexuality. I was a model, a mannequin.]{.font4}

vulgarity & obscenity seen on many levels today in all circles.]{.font4}

out where he was getting these ideas--- from the magazines that make us
out to be objects. This pornography had pictures of severed limbs and
other parts of the anatomy, actual rape scenes showing the woman
supposedly showing pleasure in the act, discrimination tones involving
other races, abusive degrading language, use of dildos on women and men,
girls who I would dare say had to be under age although I can't prove,
(or insinuating relations with a girl of a very young age).]{.font4}

[In my work with prostitutes, I have found pornography to be harmful to

[]{#minnExhibits2.xhtml#bookmark12}[Exhibit 13 \[44\]: Letter of Phyllis
Chesler, Ph. D., December 7, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[Based on fourteen years of clinical research and clinical practice,
(1969-Present, 1983), I have found that pornography significantly adds
to women's psychological stress. After the sexual abuse, repression, and
segregation of female children, pornographic literature, images, and
practices, contributes to the abuse of adult women and female
children.]{.font4}

[In my professional opinion, pornography, together with certain other
practices, contributes to women's masochism, chronic depression, anxiety
and lowered self-esteem. For example, most women continually compare
themselves with tyrannizing images of beauty. Pornographic images and
expectations then turns what they feel about themselves, into a deeper
self-hatred, and into greater attempts to please men, in order to be
loved, in order to avoid being seen as truly "ugly. "]{.font4}

[Pornography, in addition to certain other practices, is potentially
involved in female problems such as frigidity or dysmenorrhea.]{.font4}

[In my professional opinion, what women learn from observing pornography
directly, or from relating to men who observe pornography directly, is
tolerance for physical, sexual and emotional abuse at male hands. This,
in turn, leads to the suppression of anger, and its consequent
self-destructive behavior among women.]{.font4}

[Pornography also hampers men's abilities to relate in intimate and
nourishing ways, particularly when they marry and create a family. For
example, as I wrote in my book,]{.font4} [About Men,]{.font4}
[pornography falsely promises men an endless supply of available women.
Pornography falsely promises men that no male-male competition or
rivalry exists for male access to "available" women. Pornography falsely
promises and sets a standard for men of constant and easily achieved
erections. Pornography falsely promises men sexual and psychological
pleasure as a result of force, sadism, selfishness, or money.]{.font4}

[To the extent to which men believe such lies---to that extent are men
divided against themselves, against their wives, and against women whom
they may love or live with.]{.font4}

[Pornographic images are unbalanced by an equal input of
non-porno-graphic images of love, lovemaking, or sexuality. This
ordinance will give women and men the unprecedented ability to lead

Account of Homicidal Insanity]{.font4 .sgc-1} [(Simon and Schuster,
1983)]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[\[A note by the editors\]]{.font4}

[This book on the serial sexual murderer Ted Bundy is based principally
on interviews conducted with him in prison between 1978 and 1983. Bundy
initiated the contact with the writers through Michaud's agent: "She
told me that Ted Bundy, the noted alleged murderer, wanted to tell his
story in a book. " (p. 8). Michaud notes in his prologue: "\[H\]e knew
that nothing he could say and no fact we could disclose would prevent
the state from electrocuting him, appeals notwithstanding, probably
within the next five years. " (p. 10). Bundy was executed by the state
in 1989.]{.font4}

[The authors state that, at a time in 1969, before Bundy had ever had
sex with anyone, when his only crimes were petty theft to support his
image: "from what he later told us at the prison, it is certain that by
this stage he had a strong appetite for violent pornography. " (p.
65).]{.font4}

[Ted Bundy followed the lead of these interviewers in creating a third
person---referred to as "this person" or "the individual" or "he"---
through whom he was able to reflect upon his background, development,
murders, and attachment to pornography.]{.font4}

[His \[Bundy's\] first substantive remarks were on the roles of sex and
violence in the development of the psychopath. "This condition, " he
explained, "is not immediately seen by the individual or identified as a
serious problem. It sort of manifests itself in an interest concerning
sexual behavior, sexual images. It might simply be an attraction such
as]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}[; or a host of other normal, healthy
sexual stimuli that are found in the environment. But this interest, for
some unknown reason, becomes geared towards matters of a sexual nature
that involve violence. I cannot emphasize enough the gradual development
of this. It is not short-term. "]{.font4}

[He told me that long before there was a need to kill there were
juvenile fantasies fed by photos of women in skin magazines\... He was
transfixed by the sight of women's bodies on provocative display. He
told me, too, of the protokiller watching X-rated movies and searching
out the more violent police dramas on television. Ted said "this person"
would carry home some pornographic book, read it, then shred it in
anger, self-disgust, and fear of discovery\....]{.font4}

["Maybe he focused on pornography as a vicarious way of experiencing
what his peers were experiencing in reality, " Ted opined, trying to
sound reflective. "Then he got sucked into the more sinister doctrines
that are implicit in pornography---the use, the abuse, the possession of
women as objects. "\...]{.font4}

[Bundy explained that "he was not imagining himself actively doing these
things, but he found gratification in reading about others so engaged.
Eventually, the interest would become so demanding for new material that
it could only be catered by what he could find in the so-called dirty
book stores\.... it does offer variety, and a certain percentage of it
is devoted toward literature that explores situations where a man, in
the context of sexual encounter, in one way or another engages in some
sort of violence toward a woman, or the victim. There are, of course, a
whole host of substitutions that could come under that particular
heading. Your girlfriend, your wife, a stranger, children---whatever---a
whole host of victims are found in this kind of literature. And in this
kind of literature, they are treated as victims. " (pp.
104-105).]{.font4}

[In one interrogation by police, which they counted on being picked up
by a surreptitious bug that malfunctioned, the authors state that Bundy
"admitt\[ed\] his voyeurism, a taste for pornography, and\... what he
called 'my problem. '" (p. 244). The authors also observe that Bundy
"retained through life his preadolescent concept of females---remote and
unreal, objects of perfection as he saw them on television and
magazines; it was small step thence to viewing them as objects for
exploitation and abuse once he began reading pornography. " (p.
309).]{.font4}

District Court, October 7, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[COMPLAINT]{.font4}

[The Complainant, being duly sworn, makes complaint to the above-named
Court and states that there is probable cause to believe that the
Defendant committed the following offense(s). The complainant states
that the following facts establish PROBABLE CAUSE:]{.font4 .sgc-2}

[Complainant, JOHN SEARLES, is a Lieutenant with the Minneapolis Police
Department, Family Violence Division, and in that capacity has
investigated this matter by reviewing the reports of fellow officers and
by personally interviewing the victim herein.]{.font4}

[Complainant has learned from \[L\], who is 19 years old, date of birth
1/24/64, that she has known the defendant,\..., date of birth 5/7/52,
for approximately nine months and \[he\] was at one time her boyfriend.
She indicated that she and the defendant had been living together in Des
Moines, Iowa, \[she\] had left the defendant at the end of August, 1983,
and had returned to Minneapolis, in order to break off the relationship.
She stated that she had received a letter from the defendant stating
that he had left town and that her clothes were at \[T\]'s
apartment,\... W. 26th ]{.font4}[Street,.. Minneapolis, Hennepin County,
Minnesota. On 9/7/83 she went over to the apartment in order to retrieve
her clothes. \[T\] answered the door and assured her that the defendant
had left two days earlier. \[T\] told her the clothes were in the closet
and when she opened the closet the defendant jumped out and pulled her
into the bathroom by holding onto her neck. The defendant then pulled
out a knife and threatened her in the face and said, "If I can't have
you, no one else will and I am going to slash up your neck. " The
defendant then lit a gas light torch and put a hanger that had been bent
into a "B" into the flame. When it was hot he put the "B" end of the
hanger on her neck and held it there. He then threatened her again with
the knife and told her he was going to cut her up and burn her face up
and that she wasn't going to get out of there without being "all fucked
up. " He also threatened to kill her. He then re-heated the hanger, came
at her with it, trying to burn her face but she put her arms up to
protect herself and was burned instead on her right arm. At that point
she heard a knock at the apartment door. \[T\]'s mother came into the
bedroom and the defendant took \[L\] into the bedroom and made her swear
on a bible that she would never leave him again. She then was taken by
the defendant to a cab waiting at the street. The defendant told her he
had a knife in his pocket and that he'd cut her up if she tried
anything. The defendant then told the cab driver to take them to\... -
3rd Avenue South, Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota, which is the
residence of the defendant's mother. \[L\] said the defendant's mother
saw her neck and asked her what had happened but that she said nothing
because she was frightened of the defendant. That night the defendant
took her upstairs to the bedroom where the defendant told her to take
her pants off. She did so because she said she was frightened. The
defendant then took her top and bra off and then had sexual intercourse
with her by placing his penis into her vagina. She then turned over and
acted like she was sleeping for the rest of the night. The next day she
and the defendant continued to stay at his mother's house. At about 2:
00 p. m., the defendant wanted some cigarettes. She asked the
defendant's mother if the two of them could walk to the store together
to get them. The defendant and his mother agreed, and she and his mother
walked to the 7-11 at 36th and Nicollet. On the way, \[L\] told the
defendant's mother that she was really afraid the defendant would kill
her and his mother replied that he wasn't crazy. When \[L\] got to 36th
and Nicollet she got on a bus and left.]{.sgc-3}

[The defendant is presently in custody on criminal sexual conduct
charges involving minor teenage girls. The victim has further told
complainant that she is extremely scared of the defendant.]{.font4}

[The Complainant, being duly sworn, makes complaint to the above-named
Court and states that there is probable cause to believe that the
Defendant committed the following offense(s). The complainant states
that the following facts establish PROBABLE CAUSE:]{.font4}

[Complainant, JOHN SE ARLES, is a Lieutenant with the
Minneapolis]{.font4}

[Police Department, Family Violence Division, and in that capacity has
investigated this matter by reviewing the reports of fellow officers and
by personally interviewing the victim and witnesses herein.]{.font4}

[Complainant has learned from \[M\], date of birth 9-23-68, the victim
herein, that on March 6, 1983, when she was 14 years old she had run
away from home and stayed with a friend for two nights. At that point,
her father picked her up and took her home where upon she ran away again
and called the defendant, \[ \], date of birth 5-7-52, whose name and
phone number she had gotten from a friend. She stated that when she
called the defendant he stated he would pick her up, along with her
sister, \[ \], and a friend, \[ \]. The defendant did pick up all three
of them and took them to his apartment at \[ \] Pleasant Avenue South,
\# \[ \], Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota. \[M\] stated this was
the first time she had ever met the defendant. At the defendant's
apartment she was offered drugs by the defendant and she smoked some
marijuana and took some speed. She also watched pornographic movies.
Then she went into the defendant's bedroom to sleep because that was
where he had told her to sleep. The defendant also told her that she
couldn't sleep in his bed with her clothes on and so she removed her
clothing and went to sleep. At some point that night she awoke and found
that the defendant was laying on top of her and was having intercourse
with her by placing his penis in her vagina. She stated she did not push
him off because she was scared. She said she knew he was 30 years old.
She stated that she told him she was 14 years old.]{.font4}

[The defendant is presently in custody on similar charges involving
other minor girls.]{.font4}

[She stated that in Jan. of 83, she was in a group home and that she ran
from the group home about the 14th of Jan. For the first 3 weeks, she
stayed with friends in Brooklyn Center and Richfield. About the middle
of March, she was walking in the area of Lake & Bloomington, hitchhiking
and was picked up by a B/M driving a small red car. This B/M offered to
let her stay at his apt. if she wanted to. She accepted and was taken to
\[ \] Pleasant Ave. So., \# \[ \], and the B/M introduced himself as
being \[ \]. She stayed with \[ \] for approx. a week and a half. He
gave her Speed, Marijuana and alcohol and they viewed porno films. While
there, she slept with him in the bedroom. He did not make any sexual
advances toward her until approx. 1 week after she moved in. One night,
he stated that he was going to have sex with her and she stated that she
was scared and did not resist and he had sexual intercourse with her. He
did not threaten her, but she was afraid that he would harm her if she
did not comply. The day after he had intercourse with her, she left, and
did not go back.]{.font4}

[While she was in the apt. for the week prior to the rape, she observed
Mr. \[ \] buying what she thought was stolen merchandise from people who
came to the door.]{.font4}

[On 3-18-83, at 1545 hrs., \[ \], DOB. 9-29-66, 16 yrs., was interviewed
in the FVD and a statement was taken. She confirmed that her sister and
\[ \] were picked up by \[ \] and taken to his apt. She also stated that
while there, she drank alcoholic beverages and witnessed the smoking of
marijuana and the taking of pills in the form of Speed. She further
stated that her sister went into the bedroom with \[ \], and that he did
not force her to do so. She does not know what transpired in the bedroom
between them, but the next morning, her sister told her that \[ \] had
screwed her. \[ \] also told her that he had had intercourse with her
sister. She did not witness any type of violent behavior on \[ \]'s part
and further stated that her sister exaggerates a lot and that she does
not tell the truth at times. It appeared thru the entire interview that
\[ \] was very protective of \[ \] and it was felt that she would warn
him at the first opportunity she got.]{.font4}

[On 3-21-83, at 1230 hrs., a search warrant was executed at \[ \]'s apt.
in the presence of Mr. \[ \]. Nothing of evidentuary \[sic\] value was
found. Some items were confiscated and later released to Mr. \[

[]{#minnExhibits3.xhtml#bookmark1}[Exhibit 18 \[55\]: Letter of Marcia
Kading, Special Projects Coordinator, Family Nurturing Center, December
8, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[In 1974, Southside Family Nurturing Center pioneered the first program
in the State of Minnesota for exclusive treatment of child abuse and
neglect involving both parents and children. The programs of Southside
Family Nurturing Center are designed to reduce the incidence of child
abuse in families referred to the Center by Hennepin County Protective
Services. The referred families have been identified as needing
treatment in order to break the intergenerational cycle of child abuse
and neglect.]{.font4}

[I have been at Southside for seven years. My first year was spent as a
teacher in the therapeutic nursery school, I then developed and
implemented the Infant-Toddler program. Along with being the coordinator
of the Infant-Toddler program, I was also a family worker. I was the
primary worker for six families at a time. It was in this capacity that
I became aware of the dynamics that take place when a woman is exposed
to pornography as a child and adolescent.]{.font4}

[We do not customarily ask about pornography on our intakes. As I became
more involved with one of my clients, she began to tell me about what
happened to her in her household. Her father had consistently showed her
pictures of nude women, saying how he was attracted to them, using
explicit language. He very often went to bars and picked up women and
came back and told her all about his experiences. He also kept an
arsenal of guns in his house.]{.font4}

[This woman was very confused about why her behavior was so much like a
victim of incest. She had three children with three different fathers,
she got involved with abusive men who used her sexually. After talking
about her background with myself and an incest therapist, she came to
realize that what she was experiencing was common to victims of incest.
This had happened even though her father had never touched her.]{.font4}

[In talking to the staff, we came up with several other families in
which pornography went hand in hand with abusive behavior. There is a
definite link between the two, they are both harmful and destructive. It
is because of this fact that I support the amendment to Title 7,
Chapters 139 and 141 of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances relating to
civil rights.]{.font4}

[]{#minnExhibits3.xhtml#bookmark2}[Exhibit 19 \[53\]: Letter of Sandra
Hewitt, Ph. D., The Kiel Clinics, December 9, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[I am a Licensed Consulting Psychologist working in the area of child
sexual abuse, an area in which I have worked intensively for the last
three years and broadly for the last eight years. About 70-80 percent of
my client load at this present time is composed of sexually abused
children ranging from preschool to school age children and adolescents.
About one year ago, a conversation with Paul Gerber from the Bureau of
Criminal Apprehension alerted me to that fact that many children have
been exposed to pornography as part of their sexual abuse. At that time,
on my case load, I indeed had a couple of children, 2 preschoolers and 1
school age child, who displayed this very strong interest in pictures of
naked children and naked adults. Having heard this from Paul it seemed
suddenly quite clear to me that these children may have experienced
exposure to pornography in the course of their abuse. When I went back
and checked with my clients, they indeed confirmed this. Since that
time, I have been routinely checking with the children I see and I find
that about 30 percent of my client load have been exposed to pornography
at some time during their abuse history. This is most important to know
because it certainly affects their presentation in treatment as they
express a strong interest in any material which tends to shock and
alienate adults.]{.font4}

[In my office I have a number of small figures from plasticine clay
which various children have made over the past three to four years when
they've been in treatment with me. I use these figures as a way of
"normalizing" the sexual abuse experience for new children or new
clients that I'm seeing. I often say to them, "This figure was made by a
child about your age and this is what happened to him/her. " In the same
way that I normalize the sexual abuse experience for children so I feel
offend-ers normalize the abuse they do by showing a child a picture. "A
picture is worth a thousand words, " and for a young child it is much
easier to show them what to do rather than tell them what to do. The
nature of young children is to be dependent on the adults in their
environment and when a trusted adult shows a child pictures of things
children can do, they usually trust them and comply.]{.font4}

[As a working professional in this area, I would very strongly support
any measure you might consider which would curtail the use of
pornography.]{.font4}

Able-Peterson, December 1, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[Recently, while lecturing on the issue of sexual
exploitation/victimization of children, in a small Wisconsin town, a
judge posed the following question: "Ms. Peterson, how would you counsel
a twelve and a nine year old boy who, simultaneously, anally and
vaginally raped a three year old girl, and when asked in court, why they
did this, they responded, 'it's okay, we saw it in Hustler magazine. '?
"]{.font4}

[To those of us across the country who work with sexually abused
children, it is common knowledge that adult pornography is often used to
introduce children to this warped sexuality and then they are
encouraged, coerced, or forced to simulate these sexual
positions.]{.font4}

[Pornography is object sexuality. It is arms, legs, breasts,
genitals---disconnected parts. When men and women view the body as
parts, and not as a whole, it is extremely dangerous to our potential
growth and evolve-ment.]{.font4}

[Because of this "object attitude, " people can no longer respect their
own bodies, or others' bodies. This becomes really evident when we note
the rise of sado-masochistic "scenes" in pornographic magazines and
movies. If it is just arms, legs, breasts, genitals, and not a person
connected to them as a whole or a complete entity, it becomes "okay" to
beat, mutilate, and tie up those parts.]{.font4}

about our own sexual selves and certainly reaches down and influences
our children about their own bodies.]{.font4}

Katherine Brady, November 29, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[My father incestuously molested me for a period of ten years when I was
ages 8 to 18. During the early stages of the molestation, some of the
things he used to coerce me into having sex with him were pornographic
materials. In the beginning, the pornography materials were man-made oil
paintings which he had taken from the inmates at two of the state
institutions at which he worked in the capacity of corrections officer
(Central State Hospital, Waupun, Wisconsin), and training officer
(Reformatory for Boys, Green Bay, Wisconsin).]{.font4}

[When I was age 10, he verbally told me about pornography and then
sneaked it to me for explanation when my mother was at work and when he
had sent my little brother off to play. Like most small children, I was
naturally curious about what seemed to be an intriguing part of life,
especially because my father seemed so excited when he talked about the
pornography with me. When he showed me the paintings for the first time,
this is how it went:]{.font4}

["I confiscated these, " he said, relishing the use of this official
word. "Took 'em away from the boys at the Reformatory. "]{.font4}

[As I sat down on the bed, he spread out the pictures so that I could
see them. They showed men and naked women and animals in all sorts of
sexual positions with each other. Looking at them, I felt a rush spread
through my body, and once again the cycle was set in motion: intense
sexual desire, total revulsion, increasing excitement, abandonment of
reason, surge of climax, sense of sin and guilt and shame of it all,
resolve to forget it until next time, (excerpted from]{.font4} [Father's
Days)]{.font4}

[No one knew better about my developing curiosity of sexual matters than
my father. My body developed early---in the sixth grade. I menstruated
in grade school. Once pubescent, he escalated the genital molestation
and by that time, his use of pornography had "sexually nurtured" (subtle
coercion) me into submission. Because I was afraid of his physical power
and verbal authority, it never occurred to me to challenge his use of
pornography. It scared me, it confused me and yet it excited me and I
felt trapped. My only escape was to send my mind off, a habit which has
taken years to correct. I became, in essence, trained to respond to the
porn for the sexual satisfaction of my father.]{.font4}

[During the years of the intense genital molestation and entrapment in
incest perpetrated by my father, and at a time when most other fathers
in families such as ours (middle-class, Midwestern, protestant
(methodist)) were teaching their children about life from the principles
set forth in The Holy Bible, my father introduced magazines such
as]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4} [in
addition to the prisoners' man-made pornography, so that I would, as my
father put it, "Be prepared for sex in life. "]{.font4}

[Over the last 10 years as I have spoken out across this nation as a
survivor of incest turned child-abuse-prevention activist, and as I have
counseled countless women, men and children about their own sexual
victimization, I have learned that the use of pornography in the
perpetration of sex crimes is alarmingly common. I can't speak for that
legion of victims, but I can say that, for me, the use of pornography in
the early stages of the fondling and set up of incest and then during
the long-term genital molestation period has caused me over]{.font4} [30
years]{.font4} [of sexual anguish, the break up of my ten-year marriage
to my high school sweetheart---the father of my two daughters, the loss
of emotional support from my family and extended family, and, of course,
the loss of any natural relationship with my father. In addition, I've
spent (and my father has spent) hundreds of thousands of dollars in
various therapies to patch up the damages of incest in our family. The
use of pornographic materials tended to give me a negative image of
myself as a female. It made me think of my body as an object for sexual
abuse which caused (sadly) the deterioration of what could have been a
joyous emotional and sexual relationship with my now
ex-husband.]{.font4}

[In closing, I really do think that the early and continual use of
pornography by my father when he was perpetrating incest, became an
integral part of the crime of incest and is comparable to the sexual
excitement and thus added thrust manifested by the use of pornography of
the pedophile/pederast who is attracted to the sexual powerlessness of
children regardless of age and gender, and who is unable to control his
sexual drives. To date, there is no cure for this type of sex offender.
One of the few experimental programs (Columbia University, New York
City) to control the sex drive of the rapist, incest perpetrator and
basic child molester has introduced a drug (Depo-Provera) and it
controls sex drive. In addition, the doctors administering that program
have barred the use of pornography materials as they have learned from
research data that pornography encourages the sex drive of sex offenders
like my father.]{.font4}

[Thank you for your work to prevent the use of pornography to
discriminate against people who are coerced and nurtured and/or trained
to respond to the stimuli that pornography presents.]{.font4}

[Please let me know if there is further information---or
testimony---that I can present.]{.font4}

[Attached is my statement regarding pornography and child sexual abuse,
derived from my research.]{.font4}

[I hope it proves helpful to the Council in its final considered
determination.]{.font4}

[Statement on Pornography and Child Sexual Abuse]{.font4}

[I am the author of]{.font4} [Kiss Daddy Goodnight: A Speakout on
Incest]{.font4 .sgc-2} [(Hawthorn, 1978; Pocket Books, 1979). This was
the first book to document---to listen to and validate---the experience
of women who had been repeatedly molested as young children by fathers
and stepfathers.]{.font4}

[Apart from giving a voice to the millions of women of all generations
in current American society who were sexually exploited as children
within the family, the book has been widely used by mental health
professionals---both those working with incest survivors, and those
working to "sensitize" offenders (meaning to re-socialize them to see
women and children, their victims, as humans).]{.font4}

[Additionally, I have done articles on child sexual abuse for major
magazines. I have spoken at sexual abuse conferences, at women\'s law
conferences, was a keynote speaker at the 1980 National Women's Studies
Association conference; and have lectured at colleges and
universities ]{.font4}[around the country (including the delivery of the
1981 Bernice M. Wright Lecture at Syracuse University).]{.sgc-3}

[I contributed a chapter ("The Cradle of Sexual Politics: Incest") to
the volume,]{.font4} [Women\'s Sexual Experiences: Explorations of the
Dark Continent]{.font4} [(part of the series, Women in Context:
Development and Stresses), Martha Kirkpatrick M. D., editor.]{.font4}

[My recent book]{.font4} [The Home Front: Notes from the Family War
Zone]{.font4} [(McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1983) is a continuation and expansion
of my original research. It is the first synthesis of all disciplines
(sociology, psychology, history, law, political science), their view and
their response to the recent "discovery" of crimes in the home: paternal
child molestation, wife battering, child abuse.]{.font4}

[Additionally, I chair the Family Violence/Incest Committee under the
National Women's Health Network.]{.font4}

[During the seven years of my research in the area of paternal child
molestation and other crimes against women and children in the family, I
have spoken with thousands of women who were molested as children by
fathers and stepfathers. I have read widely in the sociological, legal,
and historical material pertinent to these abuses. And I have spoken
with most (indeed, possibly all) of the leading experts in this
area.]{.font4}

[There is certainly no consensus that pornography]{.font4}
[causes]{.font4} [paternal child molestation across the board: few would
claim that if you eradicated child pornography, you would eliminate
child sexual abuse.]{.font4}

[There is evidence, however, of a direct linkage in an as yet
unquantified number of cases.]{.font4}

[The linkage is to both publicly available, printed and filmed,
pornographic materials, and to privately circulated, "home-made"
pornographic pictures of child-victims.]{.font4}

[Several psychiatric experts I've spoken with recently, including child
sexual abuse expert Dr. Roland Summit, Harbor General Hospital,
Torrance, California, have referred to the growing incidence (that is,
the greater number of cases coming to their attention) of men making
private sexual-pornographic use of their children, exchanging and
selling the photographs (and sometimes the children).]{.font4}

[Within the last month, I have heard from a woman whose former husband
was, as her four-year-old son testified, molesting the child during
visitation, photographing him in pornographic poses, and sharing both
the child and the pictures with friends.]{.font4}

[And I've heard from a Connecticut lawyer about a case she had where the
woman had re-married a well-to-do man. She'd brought two young girls to
the marriage, and he two young boys. One morning, she went to his
briefcase in search of two tax forms she knew she had to sign. In it,
she found a pack of pornographic pictures of the girls.]{.font4}

[The case of Annabelle (see attached chapter) is far from unique. It
falls into a category which Dr. Summit and JoAnn Kryso call "Perverse
Incest" or "Pornographic Incest, " as they say, "in the absence of any
better superlatives to describe kinky, unfettered lechery. These cases
become more bizarre, more frankly erotic, more flagrantly manipulative
and destructive than those in earlier categories. Many of them have a
kind of self-conscious, sex-scene quality in which the individual seems
to be trying to set up rituals to fulfill a variety of forbidden
fantaises \[sic\]\....]{.font4}

["This group is called pornographic because of an apparent need to go
beyond limits of socially acceptable sexual practice]{.font4}
[\[sic\]]{.font4} [to explore whatever is most forbidden. Furthermore,
the participants may want to record their achievements and to see
themselves putting the fantasies into action: diaries, secret
confessions and Polaroid photographs seem to heighten their
excitement.]{.font4}

["Here the activity with children is contrived to gratify perverse needs
and the rationalization evolves as a denial of guilt. Here the child is
an accessory of the adult"---in what the authors describe as "lurid
parodies of adult sexual function. "]{.font4}

[These "lurid parodies" are the very stuffs]{.font4} [\[sic\]]{.font4}
[of commercial pornography---adult pornography, as well as child
pornography.]{.font4}

[Although child pornography is illegal, it remains available. And any
diminished availability is more than compensated for by the
proliferation of homemade pornography. And by the rampant
infantilization of women in adult pornography---their graphic
representation as child-like, in pigtails, with lollipops.]{.font4}

[The Brooke Shields-ing of children and the infantilization of adult
women in pornography---from that which is raw and violent, to that which
is "soft core" and in the major media---are not anomalous as they might
seem. They both represent the permission for men to exploit women and
children.]{.font4}

[That Dr. Summit and JoAnn Kryso, in the paper quoted from above, slip
into speaking of going "beyond limits of socially acceptable social
practice" in a paper called "Sexual Abuse of Children: A Clinical
Spectrum"]{.font4} [(American Journal of Orthopsychiatry,]{.font4}
[April, 1978), suggests the appalling reality of the risk
children---girl children most especially---are born into in this
country.]{.font4}

[It is a reality for which pornography represents the green light, and
signifies the chest-thumping boast.]{.font4}

[Whether or not pornography is causative of real abuse practices, it is
fully and profoundly]{.font4} [supportive]{.font4} [of them, as the
recent rash of public rapes of women with the full and hearty support
and assent of numerous male onlookers attests to. Pornography
"de-sensitizes" men to the real and gross violation of a human being
involved. It violates the civil rights of those its advocacy places at
serious risk.]{.font4}

[Much is currently being written about our inability to differentiate
the images we are subjected to from reality. A recent piece by Barbara
Goldsmith in]{.font4} [The New York Times]{.font4} [(12/4/83) quotes
social historian Daniel J. Boorstin, writing in 1962 of "what then
seemed a distant threat": "We risk being the first people in history to
have been able to make their illusions so vivid, so persuasive, so
realistic, that they can live in them. " Although Goldsmith is writing
on "The Meaning of Celebrity, " her basic thesis---which is that images
in our culture can override ethics, and throw exotic lawlessness and
cruelty up to whet the public appetite (and so start a fad of gourmet
abuse)---holds true for the image-power of pornography as well.]{.font4}

[Goldsmith quotes George Gerbner, dean of the University of
Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communications. He "estimates that by
the time a typical American child reaches adulthood, he or she will have
absorbed more thn \[sic\] 30, 000 electronic 'stories. '! "\] These
have, he suggests, replaced the socializing role of the pre-industrial
church in creating "a cultural mythology" that establishes the norm of
approved behavior and belief. \[ \] No one has yet totted up the number
of hours the typical American has spent absorbing pornographic images of
women and children, both hard-core and soft. Perhaps someone should. For
a person living, say on the west side of Greenwich Village in Manhattan,
and working in, say, the Daily News Building on East 42nd Street, taking
any form of surface transportation (bus, taxi, limousine) would provide
you with between one hour and two hours of sexual victimization "rads" a
day.]{.font4}

[Pornography on cable should improve the dosage for every
citizen.]{.font4}

[I did not specifically direct my research to the role of pornography in
child sexual abuse. Because that is true, it strikes me as more
significant that I hear about its role as frequently as I do.]{.font4}

[What is key to the issue is that]{.font4} [permission,]{.font4}
[societal permission, is at the core of real paternal child molestation;
and at the core of most marital and stranger rape.]{.font4}

[Pornography is a blatant and powerful manifestation of that
permission.]{.font4 .sgc-2}

[It gives the public stamp of approval to the degradation,
objectification and exploitation of the two social groups whose
victimization it lustily portrays and heartily endorses---in
ever-escalating degrees of violence and contempt.]{.font4}

[Repealing this permission by enfranchising those victimized---granting
them the civil rights of citizenship in America---would represent
extraordinary progress and social change toward the equal rights and
equal protection under the law which the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights attempt to guarantee.]{.font4}

[Because we have donned a moral cloak of]{.font4} [apparent]{.font4}
[outrage following the recent "discovery" of widespread child sexual
exploitation in the home, let me briefly give evidence of the
permission. (Further documentation can be found in]{.font4} [The Home
Front. )]{.font4}

[Let's turn, almost at random, to one of the country's most respected
psychiatrists, Dr. Joseph Rheingold, of Harvard University, with claim
to 2, 500 cases. In 1967, he published a book titled,]{.font4} [The
Mother, Anxiety and Death.]{.font4} [The book focussed on
destructive/seductive mothers. But he diverted from this focus to say,
"The\'father is seductive too (of the daughter, very rarely the son),
but the clinical evidence indicates that seduction of the girl is
without significant pathogenic effect, even where it involves actual
incest. It is the father's indifference to her femininity or his
surreptitious interest that is detrimental to the girl's self-concept
and the reason for strong protest against him later in life. "]{.font4}

[Note the---not only permission---but prescription for real-life, actual
sexual exploitation of girl-children here, so as to ward off any strong
protest against the father later in life.]{.font4}

[In light of this, it is no less than wondrous that some people object
to pornography because children get hold of it.]{.font4}

[The permission to sexually abuse, exploit, and do violence to, women
and children, is a historical one. Pornography, too, was, historically,
available. Now, however, it has greater prevalence and greater power: it
threatens to irradiate the public, and alter even what moral genetic
structure we may have had.]{.font4}

[What distance is there between the depiction of children "begging" for
sex in pornographic display, and Maggie's father (in]{.font4} [Kiss
Daddy Goodnight)]{.font4} [saying to then-three-year-old Maggie, "Tell
me you like it. No, tell me you really like it. No, tell me like you
mean it"?]{.font4}

[What distance between the cartoon in]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}
[showing an adult male in the bathroom doorway and a small girl
adjusting her clothing and saying, "Is that what you call child
molestation? "---and the North American Man-Boy Love Association
(NAMBLA) seeking the "liberty" to legally exploit children sexually
because the kids have a right to it?]{.font4}

[Or between the Rene Guyon Society with its slogan, "Sex by eight or
else it's too late"---and the millions of fathers and stepfathers across
the centuries who have ordered, and are today ordering, their children
into sexual servitude with the words, "It's natural. " And, not
infrequently, in my listening experience, adding, "I saw it in a
magazine. "]{.font4}

[The major effort of therapeutic programs for rapists and child
molesters is "sensitization": the effort to personify, to de-objectify,
in these men's minds, their victims.]{.font4}

[Psychologist Jonathan Ross, co-director of the Forensic Mental Health
Center in New London, Connecticut, which treats child molesters, says,
"These guys are responding to a blanket permission\[. \] Kids are
sexual\[. \] There's nothing wrong with it. "]{.font4}

[Then, I ask him, is that therapy you're doing in your treatment? Isn't
it re-socializing?]{.font4}

["Yes. These guys perceive the kids as objects. As]{.font4}
[theirs]{.font4}[. Permission for this is everywhere in society. Kids
are sexual. It's OK. "]{.font4}

[I ask, But then aren't you really re-socializing guys to a society
which doesn't exist yet?]{.font4}

[He agrees.]{.font4}

[Pornography is a heavy duty, all-pervasive part of that permission. And
for the most part it carries the extra-heavy-duty, sin-free sugar
coating that the women and child victims are really loving every minute
of it.]{.font4}

[Bridgeport, Connecticut, attorney Cecilia Rosenberg is a member of the
Masters Panel for Family Court, and has a degree in psychiatric social
work. She says there's so much child molestation, "there's enough of it
to be routine. It is something fathers feel they have a right to do. The
underlying assumption is that females and children are available to
them. If they don't use them sexually, it's an act of forbearance.
"]{.font4}

[Pornography is the billboard on which that permission is posted across
the United States of America.]{.font4}

[When you abolish slavery, give blacks the vote, provide equal
employment opportunity, give them access to the courts when they are
depicted in gross ways, or slurred or slandered, you do not eliminate
racism. You do however publicly and societally disavow it as socially
acceptable. You empower its victims to seek remedy within the law: to go
to America, as American citizens, for justice.]{.font4}

[Women and children---two-thirds of America---should, it seems to me,
have the same citizenship and civil rights when demeaned, outraged, and
made increasingly vulnerable by increasingly available, and increasingly
vitriolic and violent pornography.]{.font4}

[It seems unlikely that someone with a satisfying sexual life would want
pornography. This raises the question of who uses pornography. Many
incest victims have difficulty establishing a satisfactory sexual
relationship with a peer. Many of the male incest victims, out of
loneliness, turn to masturbation. For many of these, pornography appears
to fill the need for masturbation fantasies. The industry also grinds up
immature incest victims of both sexes and stuffs them into the sausage
skins of pornographic films. Most pornographers are themselves incapable
of maintaining relationships and a logical hypothesis is that many of
them may be incest victims themselves.]{.font4}

abuse? Everybody must reach out to both male and female victims of child

[A convicted rapist, Chuck, is described by the author as
follows:]{.font4}

[At twenty, after two painful years of marriage, he separated from his
wife and daughter, and felt enormous rage toward women for a year. One
night while high on alcohol, pot, heroin, and downers, he went into a
pornographic bookstore and watched a twenty-five-cent peep show that
portrayed a man raping a woman. That night he attempted his first rape.
Within ten days he had attempted three, succeeded in one and was
contemplating a fourth, (p. 71)]{.font4}

[Chuck himself says this:]{.font4}

["One night about a year after I split from my wife, I was out partyin'
and drinkin' and smokin' pot. I'd shot up some heroin and done some
downers and I went to a porno bookstore, put a quarter in a slot, and
saw this porn movie. It was just a guy coming up from behind a girl and
attacking her and raping her. That's when I started having rape
fantasies. When I seen that movie, it was like somebody lit a fuse from
my childhood on up. When that fuse got to the porn movie, I exploded. I
just went for it, went out and raped. It was like a little voice saying,
'it's all right, it's all right, go ahead and rape and get your revenge;
you'll never get caught. Go out and rip off some girls. It's all right;
they even make movies of it. ' The movie was just like a big picture
stand with words on it saying go out and do it, everybody's doin' it,
even the movies. So I just went out that night and started lookin'. "
(pp. 73-74)]{.font4}

[In response to being asked "If there had been no pornographic movies
showing rape, would you have raped? " Chuck answers:]{.font4}

["I think I would've hurt a woman in a different way physically. If I
wouldn't have committed rape I'd be in prison for murder right now,
because it was goin' that way. I would've killed my next victim or the
one after that\... Pornographic movies have a lot to do with rape\...
Specials are okay because they can tell what can happen in rape, but a
TV movie, a porn movie, or a regular movie about rape---they should ban
them. You look at these movies and think, 'Wow, I wonder what it would
be like to go out and rape somebody! ' I heard stories in the hospital
of people saying society must condone it---they have it on TV and
movies. I know five or six guys who saw pictures of rape in a dirty book
and believed it was all right to go out and rape; just still snapshots
and that justified it to them. It said, okay, go out and rape because
it's in a dirty book; there's nothing wrong with it. That goes for child
molesting, too. " (p. 79)]{.font4}

Lovestar, December 6, \[1983\]]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[I have some feelings and opinions about pornography that I would like
\[to\] express here. I'm certain that a great deal of information will
be presented regarding the victimization of women thru]{.font4}
[\[sic\]]{.font4} [pornography. I expect, too, that those presenting
that testimony would be, appropriately, women.]{.font4}

[I'd like to speak to the ways pornography harms me as a man. At its
fundamental level pornography is lies about my sexuality. My sexual
relationships with women are based on respect, trust, and love as best
as I can feel & express those. The absence of these elements in
pornography creates an incomplete and untrue portrayal of sexuality. It
has given me and countless other men an education about sexual relations
that is lacking in some essential components. I resent the existence of
such misleading material.]{.font4}

[Given that this presents an incomplete portrayal of sexual relations,
it is presented in such a way that takes gross disadvantage of men's
vulnerability. Men who take joy and celebration in their sexuality don't
frequent X-rated stores. Men seek this outlet in a state of fear, shame,
and powerlessness. They find a counterfeit and temporary sense of power
and control. We (I've been there) are offered temporary respite, tho
\[sic\] not comfort, from our pain. Our pain & humanity are ignored,
even denied. All that counts is that we are male and can afford the
price of this ersatz pleasure. Men who fear to look a woman in the eye
can see images of the feared party in states of degradation. Men ashamed
of their gender and sexuality can witness scenes of men who appear not
\[to\] experience these feelings. Someone makes money off the suffering
and loneliness of men who deserve recognition of their state from
themselves as well as from the men and women. Pornography has no
winners---women are abused and portrayed as powerless for the eyes of
men who feel abused and powerless. I support any effort to challenge the
system that this represents and submit that pornography hurts everyone
and we all have a stake in its demise.]{.font4}

National Organization for Men, December 1, 1983]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[I am writing to you in support of the proposed ordinance concerning
pornography as it affects the civil rights of women.]{.font4}

[As chair of the antipornography task group of the National Organization
for Men, I have had occasion to conduct workshops with men that deal
with men's attitudes toward various forms of pornography. I have
observed a rather clear pattern of recognition among men in these
workshops that the commercial depictions and use of women in
pornographic magazines and films do in fact have the effect of making
women seem subservient, inferior, degraded, and enjoying pain and
humiliation. However much these men report having some history of sexual
arousal in relation to such material (and I have observed these
histories to vary greatly), I find a pattern of quite candid
acknowledgment that such pornographic treatments of women are without
any question expressions of violence, power, hostility and aggression
against women.]{.font4}

[I have also found that many men report some degree of anger at their
own recognition of how their own sexuality has been manipulated and
shaped by pornography.]{.font4}

[From the context of my experience talking with men in depth and at
length about their perceptions of what pornography is about, I believe I
can testify that a significant number of men when speaking honestly
about themselves and their feelings would acknowledge that much
pornography is indeed an expression of a will to power over women and
that in its debasement of women it feels like debasement of men as
well.]{.font4}

[I applaud your landmark approach to this issue. I think you have found
precisely the way to define what is hurtful in pornography and how a
community can begin to heal and redress that great harm.]{.font4}

[As someone who looks to Minnesota for national leadership in social
policy I urge you to amend Title VII by including pornography as a form
of sex discrimination. Your leadership is as historically important here
as in making clear that rape is violence not sexual expression or that
sexual harassment is a major form of sexual discrimination. It is
demonstrable that pornography teaches and legitimizes the violence,
torture, humiliation and inferiority of women. It is demonstrable that
women have been harassed and terrorized out of jobs, neighborhoods,
union membership, and educational programs through purposeful
pornographic displays. This ordinance does not constitute prior
restraint but does allow citizens to bring their grievances before the
court. It could also be a valuable parallel for constitutional redress
of grievances of blacks and other racial groups who have been harassed
out of jobs and neighborhoods by the literature of racial violence.
Constitutional authorities have long made clear that states and
municipalities must be the laboratories for social experimentation. This
is a rare opportunity for Minneapolis to continue a traditional path to

on Pornography, December 26, 1983]{.font6 .sgc-1}

[TO: [Minneapolis City Council]{.sgc-3}]{.font3}

[FROM:]{.font3} [Catharine A. MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin]{.font4} 

[RE:]{.font3} [Proposed Ordinance on Pornography]{.font4} 

[DATE:]{.font3} [26 December 1983]{.font4}

[Several of you have suggested to us that a short paper addressing some
frequently asked questions would be helpful. Here we briefly discuss
what this ordinance is trying to do, how it would work, why it is
different from past approaches, and we assess supposed
obstacles.]{.font4}

[1]{.font4}[.  ]{.font4}[What this ordinance is trying to do]{.font4
.sgc-4}

[This ordinance defines pornography for what it is. Its central feature
is that it subordinates women through sex. The influence of pornography
on men who rule societies, and thus on the development of misogynist
social institutions, can be traced back through feudalism, but it is
only through relatively recent technology that the social environment
has been glutted with pornography so that it hurts women openly,
publicly, and with social legitimacy. This same pervasiveness and open
availability have also made it possible to understand and document the
effects of pornography, hence its place in the institutionalization of
second class citizenship for women, for the first time in
history.]{.font4}

[The use of women in pornography and the impact of pornography on
women's status and treatment is the primary focus of this ordinance.
Pornography promotes environmental terrorism and private abuse of women
and girls and, to a lesser extent, men and boys and transsexuals.
Society's efforts toward the civil and sexual equality of women and
men ]{.font4}[are severely hampered---frankly, nearly destroyed---by the
success of pornography. Most frequently, the pornography promotes rape,
pain, humiliation and inferiority as experiences that are sexually
pleasing to all women because we are women. The studies show that it is
not atypical for men to believe and act on the pornography. Each time
men are sexually aroused by pornography---the sexually explicit
subordination of women---they learn to connect women's sexual pleasure
to abuse and women's sexual nature to inferiority. They learn this in
their bodies, not just their minds, so that it becomes a physical,
seemingly natural, response. When real women claim not to want
inequality or force, they are not credible compared with the continually
sexually available "real women" in pornography. These men are the same
normal men who make decisions that control much of women's lives and
opportunities at every level of society. Until women achieve equal power
with men, such men are in a position to control women's employment,
educational advancement, social status and credibility in the media, on
paper, on the street, in meetings, in court, in their own homes, and in
public office. The fact that some women have successfully fought some of
this discrimination does not prove it does not exist; it proves that
victories, like the victory this ordinance would be, can be
won.]{.sgc-5}

[In the hearings, we learned that it takes coercion to make
pornography---for instance,]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4 .sgc-4}[*,*
the highest grossing film ever.\* We learned that pornography is forced
on women and children and that frequently the women and children are
then raped or forced to do what is in the pornography. We learned that
pornography is used in sexual assaults and to plan the sexual assaults.
We learned that exposure to pornography increases male aggression toward
women and leads men to see women as things, less than human, and wanting
and liking rape and torture and humiliation. We also learned that
pornography has been used to, and has the effect of, terrorizing women
in their homes, in their neighborhoods, and in their places of work. We
learned that pornography is used in relationships that range from the
intimate to the anonymous in ways that give women no choice about seeing
the pornography or doing the sex.]{.font4}

[\*]{.font4}[ It is, of course, difficult to document the profits of
organized crime precisely. However,]{.font3 .sgc-6} [Deep Throat]{.font3
.sgc-6} [ended the 1970s "with an estimated gross income of six hundred
million dollars from paying customers for the film itself. " Gloria
Steinem, "The Real Linda Lovelace, "]{.font3 .sgc-6} [Outrageous Acts
and Everyday Rebellions]{.font3 .sgc-6} [(Holt, Rinehart,]{.font3
.sgc-6} [&]{.font3 .sgc-6} [Winston, 1983), p. 243. This figure does not
include videocassette or other spin-off product profits.]{.font3 .sgc-6}

[The purpose of the ordinance is to make available an effective remedy
to those who choose to use it, so that women need no longer be paralyzed
or passive or held back by the lack of a legitimate avenue for redress
in the face of pornography---the systematic discrimination, the condoned
brutality, and the glorified debasement that defines the condition of an
entire group of people.]{.sgc-5}\

[2.  ]{.font4}[How the ordinance would work]{.font4 .sgc-4}

[Like any other law that prohibits discrimination, this law would make
available the administrative apparatus of the Human Rights Commission
and the courts to adjudicate complaints. Once the law goes into effect,
a person who has been coerced into a pornographic performance, had
pornography forced on them, or has been assaulted of physically attacked
or injured in a way directly caused by a specific piece of pornography
could choose to complain to the Commission or go directly to court. Any
woman can also complain against traffickers in pornography. Because the
data from the hearings show that pornography increases male aggression
against women, the public availability of the pornography, as defined in
the ordinance, is in and of itself a violation of women's rights to
equal personhood and citizenship. The systematic sexual subordination of
the pornography]{.font4} [is]{.font4} [the injury under this section of
the act.]{.font4}

[The Commission or the court would then see if the pornography
complained of meets the definition of pornography in the statute. The
definition of pornography in the statute states exactly what pornography
is and does. It describes exactly the trafficking in women engaged in by
the pornographers, which ranges from dehumanizing women as sexual things
and commodities to torturing and maiming women as sexual acts. The
dehumanization is fundamental to the subordination and the precondition
for the more explicit violence. It is tempting to consider proceeding
one step at a time, disallowing the explicit violence while allowing the
dehumanization, objectification, and submission. This would leave
the]{.font4} [inequality]{.font4} [intact. Such an approach would not go
to the heart of this form of subordination. It would also draw a legal
line that would take immense resources to adjudicate because it is not a
line that can be drawn because it is not a line that is drawn in the
pornography.]{.font4}

[The definition includes everything that is pornography and does not
include anything that is not. It does not include sex education, for
instance, or erotica, which is sexually explicit sex premised on
equality. Any law can be abused. Cynical attempts to undermine this law
may center on attempts to apply it to materials and acts for which it
was not intended. The pornographers have a lot of money and power at
stake in making this law look bad. We believe that the Commission and
the courts are as reliable instruments for distinguishing frivolous
abuses from bona fide injuries in these cases as they are in any other
kind of discrimination case.]{.font4}

[The most legally likely place for issues other than sex discrimination
to arise---issues such as the First Amendment---is as a defense. When
sued under this ordinance, the pornographers are likely to say that it
violates their First Amendment rights. The point here is that
customarily people have to have a legal injury before they can sue. They
can not customarily sue a law-making body just because it has passed a
civil law that they do not like or agree with or think]{.font4}
[might]{.font4 .sgc-4} [be applied to them. People activate civil claims
by alleging that someone else hurt them in a way the law recognizes.
This means that other legal issues, such as the First Amendment, are
most likely to be raised as defenses by pornographers against those who
complain or sue them for injuries, rather than as a basis for a direct
suit against anyone. Once an action commences against a respondent, they
can seek to involve the city or the agency and/or to challenge the
ordinance on its face. We discuss why we think that such uses of the
First Amendment may not prevail in section 4.\
]{.font4}

[3. *Why this approach is better than past approaches *]{.sgc-3}

[The major distinction between the civil rights approach to
pornography ]{.sgc-8}[and past approaches to all the problems of sexual
inequality it involves ]{.sgc-8}[is that this is the first time the
legal concept of the injury is the same as]{.sgc-8} [the real social
injury pornography does. Obscenity laws, besides
allowing ]{.sgc-8}[inconsistent, ill-conceived or politically motivated
criminal prosecutions, ]{.sgc-8}[created a lot of confusion about
pornography by misidentifying ]{.sgc-8}[the harm. Many people mistake
obscenity for pornography. Obscenity is ]{.sgc-8}[a criminal legal term.
One possible root meaning of the word "obscene" ]{.sgc-8}[is the ancient
Greek for "off stage"---in effect, that which should not
be ]{.sgc-8}[shown, especially in the theatre for aesthetic reasons.
This suggests that ]{.sgc-8}[the injury of obscenity has to do with what
is publicly viewed; the injury ]{.sgc-8}[of pornography is what is done,
whether it is public or private. Another ]{.sgc-8}[possible and more
likely root meaning of the word "obscene" is the Latin ]{.sgc-8}[for
"against filth": Is a given work "filth" and are we, the people,
against ]{.sgc-8}[it. Obscenity is not a synonym for pornography in this
meaning either. ]{.sgc-5}[Obscenity is a social value judgment.
Pornography is concrete. Its rootmeaning is "the graphic depiction of
whores. " Everybody may have an idea of what is or is not obscene,
especially given the myriad inconsistent legal definitions over the last
200 years. Pornography is specific, concrete, and, as we have said,
about the sexually explicit subordination of women. In pornography,
women are graphically depicted as whores by nature, that is, defined by
our status as Sexual chattel. Because the definition in the ordinance is
concrete, specific, narrow, and describes what is actually there, it is
not vague, not overly broad, not about ideas that some people think are
good or bad, moral or immoral, normal or abnormal, natural or unnatural,
nor does the ordinance suggest, as obscenity law does, that women's
bodies are dirty or sex is dirty. A final distinction between obscenity
and pornography is crucial. Courts have been hampered in enforcing
obscenity laws because there was no evidence of the harm obscenity does
to match the scope of the laws enacted. The harm of obscenity could not
be documented or measured because it did not exist. Evidence from the
hearings provided evidence for the harm of pornography because it
identified the harm that pornography actually does: to the status and
treatment of women.]{.sgc-5}

[The proposed ordinance differs from past approaches by going
significantly beyond any existing law that regulates acts committed
against women. Now, before this law, people who are coerced into
pornography have no effective way to reach the pornography made by
coercing them. The profit incentive to coercing more and more women
remains. If they complain, they are not believed, in part because
pornography in general convinces people that women love doing it and in
part because the specific pornography they are forced to make is often
convincing in depicting their simulated enjoyment. Now, before this law,
when women are sexually assaulted, because the society is saturated by
pornography, they are unlikely to be believed in court and are
continually asked pornographic questions like, did you like it? Now,
before this law, child pornography is a crime in Minnesota but forcing
pornography on children is not. Often, adult pornography in which women
are infantilized is used. Such pornography continues to target children
for sexual assault, even if the models have actually aged one day beyond
their minority.]{.font4}

[Unlike all other previous approaches to the growing social problem of
pornography, including zoning laws which have at times hurt poor and
working-class neighborhoods or segregated women out of whole sections of
cities, this law stands against the real traffic in real women. It is a
civil law]{.font4} [against]{.font4 .sgc-4} [pornography, but it is
also]{.font4} [for]{.font4 .sgc-4} [the equality of the sexes, women's
rights, and the integrity and dignity of all persons regardless of sex.
And it will]{.font4} [do]{.font4} [something: empower people and call
into question the legal immunity of the exploiters for the first
time.]{.font4}

[4.  ]{.font4}[Assessment of supposed obstacles]{.font4 .sgc-4}

[Nothing exactly like this law has ever been tried, so it can not be
said conclusively that it will or will not work or will or will not be
constitutionally upheld. Because it is part of the civil code, not the
criminal code, there will be no state ban or police enforcement. Because
it is not an obscenity law, nothing ever done under obscenity law
strictly controls the interpretation of this law, although prior case
law may indicate judicial attitudes toward some of the issues involved.
The First Amendment right to speech has never been absolute. In the one
case where the Supreme Court has balanced a municipal sex discrimination
ordinance prohibiting sex segregation in advertising against the First
Amendment, the ordinance won (1973). More recently, the Supreme Court,
recognizing child pornography to be a form of child abuse, allowed
states to make it a crime. The harm that the child pornography industry
did to children allowed something that is speech (not obscenity) to be
illegal consistent with the First Amendment. (The ACLU defended child
pornography as speech throughout the litigation. ) Our hearings show a
similar level of harm done to women in adult pornography, as well as the
integral role adult pornography plays in child abuse. The pornographers
have relied for their impunity upon the indistinguishability of what
they push from any other form of expression. This proposed ordinance
draws a line that distinguishes them. The pornographers have convinced
many that their freedom is everyone's freedom, obscuring what this
statute is based on: the freedom of the pornographers enforces the
subordination of women.]{.font4}

[The First Amendment mainly prohibits state acts that interfere with
speech. But there is an affirmative, if less prominent, side to the
First Amendment that would allow the silence of women because of
discrimination to be taken into the balance. The fairness doctrine in
broadcasting, for example, recognizes that government sometimes has an
obligation to help make access to speech available on an equal basis.
The First Amendment's goals are furthered by restricting the speech of
some so that others might have access to it. Pornography directly
contributes to a silencing of women that is socially pervasive. The
First Amendment is undermined when women are kept from having access to
the social preconditions to exercise the rights the First Amendment
guarantees from infringement by states. Equal access to the means of
speech, which pornography discriminatorily denies to women sexually and
socially, is a First Amendment goal that is furthered by this
law.]{.font4}

[The civil rights approach, unlike morals legislation and police power,
is strengthened by the support of legal concepts outside the First
Amendment, namely equal protection (the Fourteenth Amendment) and
anti-discrimination law. That the systematic relegation of an entire
group of people to inferiority because of a condition of birth should be
illegal is not a new idea. This ordinance to further the equality of the
sexes embodies an interest particularly appropriate for that level of
representative government closest to the people.]{.font4}

[For immediate release: July 25, 1984 ]{.font4}

[Contact: Cheryl Champion \[phone number deleted\]]{.font4}

[There will be a press conference on Wednesday, July 25, 3: 00]{.font4}
[p. m.,]{.font3} [at the Minnesota Press Club. It has been called by
women whose lives have been directly damaged by pornography and who have
been waiting, out of the public eye, hoping to be able to bring
complaints under an amendment to the Civil Rights Code.]{.font4}

[Now, we feel it is time to make a public statement, encouraging the
City Council to override the Mayor's veto.]{.font4}

[There is a cost to waiting---waiting for a decision in a significantly
different lawsuit in Indianapolis. The cost of waiting is more and more
damaged lives, our lives, and the lives of countless other women,
children, and men. It seems absurd to us to consider the possibility of
having to spend money to defend the law more important than human lives.
Two sample paragraphs from one of the statements follow:]{.font4}

> [When I grew up, I had a relationship with a man who had posters
> from]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4} [and other pornography on the walls
> of his room. He raped me there, although I didn't call it rape at the
> time. I would say, "I don't want to. " He would say, "Oh yes you do."
> He had a warped view of sexuality, of how women and men act. I came to
> see myself alone as worthless, as a commodity.]{.font4}

> [Earlier this year I had a job at a company which uses women in ads to
> sell its products. They had a lot of porn around. Men had centerfolds
> on their office walls. I was continually sexually harassed there. Men
> would call me "legs" or "honey" or "baby" or "sweetie"---never my

> The more I resisted, the worse it got. Finally, I quit because a man
> grabbed me and the manager only reprimanded him.]{.font4}

[We have invited three people to join us. Council Member Sharon Sayles
Belton has been asked to make a statement about how an override of the
Mayor's veto would affect situations like the one involving Vanessa
Williams.]{.font4}

[Cheryl Champion, from Sexual Assault Services at Washington County
Human Services, has worked with victims of sexual assault for many
years. She will speak about the deep connection of pornography with all
forms of sexual abuse.]{.font4}

the Civil Rights Ordinance.]{.font4}

[Good Afternoon.]{.font4}

[We have called this press conference to make an appeal to the city
council members of Minneapolis to override the Mayor's veto and make the
Pornography Ordinance Law.]{.font4}

[Who We Are]{.font4}

[You will hear from each of us individually. We ask that you be
respectful of the courage it requires to make this kind of public
testimony. Some of us will be familiar to you, others of us will attempt
to remain anonymous. Each time we have met with the press, women have
come forward to speak with strength about the harm done to us. Women
will continue to come forward. We are not members of some lunatic
fringe, we are members of \[the\] community, citizens in good
standing.]{.font4}

[Format]{.font4}

[We will each speak individually, at the end, some of us will leave and
some of us will remain to answer questions. We ask that you hold your
questions until the end.]{.font4}

[Statement]{.font4}

[I am not here to talk about myself, but to give credibility to my
statement, I will tell you, my name is Cheryl Champion, I have worked in
the field of sexual abuse for 14 years. Since 1975, I have worked in
Minnesota. The Minnesota Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, of which
I am a member, represents 37 statewide programs. I have also been a
member of the Board of Directors of the National Coalition Against
Sexual Assault, a coalition of programs from across the United States.
But \[I'm\] choosing to speak instead for the women unable to be here
today.]{.font4}

[I am here representing 14 years of work in the anti-rape movement, a
movement created by voiceless, anonymous women. Women who fought,
organized, \[lobbied\] and in some cases, gave their lives to fight
against sexual abuse.]{.font4}

[Pornography does not exist in isolation. This is not an issue of
special interest for a small minority group. The sadistic violence and
sexual enslavement we speak of is not isolated or remote---it is real.
It is in the stories of the battered wives, molested children and raped
women that happen everyday. It is precisely because this sexual violence
is so immediate in our lives, we have been fighting for our survival,
there has been no time to address this cause until now.]{.font4}

[It is evident that pornography could not be the product of a non sexist
culture where women are acknowledged as fully valuable human persons. In
a non sexist culture it would be shocking and intolerable to the
community to view these images of women. In ours it is
commonplace.]{.font4}

[We will know that we are free when pornography no longer exists. As
long as it does exist we must understand that "we are the women in it, "
used by the same people, subject to the same devaluation.]{.font4}

[Porn and prostitution will be the last to fall. There are rape crisis
centers, there are battered women's shelters, there are incest treatment
programs. As disbelieved as rape victims, incest victims and battered
women were in the past, so are the prostitutes and pornographed models
now\[a\]days. Women in pornography do not see a society that will stand
behind them, individuals who will help them. They are the last group of
powerless women.]{.font4}

[]{#minn-press.xhtml#bookmark3}[Statement of Rev. Susan Wilhelm]{.font4
.sgc-1}

[I am Rev. Susan Wilhelm. I had not realized the extent of the harm
pornography has done to me until this past winter, when I was working on
a photo-montage of kinds of pornography for an educational forum. I came
across a picture of a position\... my ex-husband had insisted we try.
When we did, I hemorrhaged for three days. My bruised cervix is still a
problem after 10 years.]{.font4}

[My father had used pornography like]{.font4} [*Argosy*, *True*, *Saga*,
*Stag*,]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [*Cavalier*.]{.font4} [They are adventure
stories, different from the slicks. No one claims they are intellectual
magazines. I was not supposed to, but I read them. There was either the
short dumpy fishwife with her hair in curlers or the beautiful sexy
available creatures. The short dumpy ones were sexually used, too, but
the man does not really enjoy them. That was my education on what women
were like.]{.font4}

[Most of my sex life with my ex-husband was very abusive. He had a lot
of pornography around the house, both the slicks and the hard core. He
went to Rochester \[Minn. \] to buy it. It made him expect that I would
want to do crazy things. He kept saying our sex life was, and I was,
dull, blah, unfun. When we were first married, he did not use
pornography and did not drink. He started drinking first. But the sex
became especially abusive after he started using pornography. He got his
ideas from it. Having sex how he wanted it was nonnegotiable.]{.font4}

[He had a fetish about hating pubic hair. He used to shave his and mine.
Once he slipped and slit my clitoris. He claimed it was an accident. If
he decided I liked something, he would try to kill it, like dogs we had.
I am convinced he tried to kill me more than once. There are also more
subtle ways of killing the spirit.]{.font4}

[He exposed me to the pornography, too. Once we saw an X-rated film that
showed anal intercourse. After that, he pressed me to try it. I agreed
to once, but found the experience very painful. He kept trying
periodically. He told me my vagina had become as sloppy as an old sow's
and he could not get pleasure any other way. He also used to pinch and
bite me. When I said "it hurts, " he would say, "no, it doesn't." I
became numb. I lost track of my own feelings. One time, he said in
reference to himself sexually, "it's supposed to hurt. " Something
started to change for me then.]{.font4}

[The mayor claims to be concerned about the cost of a court test of the
civil rights ordinance. But what about the cost of the human lives that
are harmed and need years of therapy to heal? We, the victims, are
paying with our lives. We should have some place to go to complain about
how the pornography is part of making our husbands into
rapists.]{.font4}

[]{#minn-press.xhtml#bookmark4}[Statement of Peggy]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[My name is Peggy.]{.font4}

[Starting at age 4, old Mr. Edwards up the street used pornography to
entice me into taking baths so he could watch, had me wearing his
wife\['\]s clothes and eventually having oral sex and being penetrated
by him. This went on for five years. He used the pornography to show me
how to be---and what to do---until I didn't see anything wrong---with
anything he did to me---or had me do to him. I became addicted to sex as
a way of getting through life. I also drank a lot. My first marriage was
purely sexual. I put up with more pornography because I thought---it
would secure my marriage---but it destroyed it. The man I lived with
last used pornography books to sexually arouse my son so he could molest
him---and my son and his friends used pornography to molest my
daughter---to experiment on her sexually---using the pornographic books
as teaching guides. What was done to all of us physically is one
thing---but you can also be crucified in your brain.]{.font4}

[I never realized the whole pattern until the last two years. I have
never been able to complete an education, or hold a steady job, I've had
two children out of wedlock, and spent most of my life until recently on
AFDC and in bars. I wonder what my life would have been, if what
happened with the pornography hadn't happened. Or---if there had been a
way to do something about it.]{.font4}

[You talk about cost---]{.font4}

[I'd like to know how much it has cost the state to support myself and
children, the county to prosecute the man who assaulted my \"children,
and for all these years of therapy for all of us, to try to undo what
the pornography did.]{.font4}

[Anyone who is worried about the cost of letting women fight
pornography, or who wonders what there is to lose in waiting a few more
years to let it start here, should think about how much of this we can
afford, and who's paying for it.]{.font4}

[What is more important, money or people's lives?]{.font4}

[]{#minn-press.xhtml#bookmark6}[Statement of Ms. P.]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[I grew up in a middle class neighborhood, attended church every week
and everyone knew my father as a public high school teacher. He has
numerous teaching awards and was a church deacon. I saw a different side
of my father, he called it his play-time. I didn't know why I posed nude
with my sister, but by age eight I was forced into my first pornographic
movie.]{.font4}

[I can still picture the set, bright cameras, and the director yelling
for me to look more seductive. My dad gave me advice when I didn't want
to touch the boy's penis. "Just pretend his body is your daddy's," he
said kissing me on the lips.]{.font4}

[At home I was raped nightly. He'd get me a glass of water, wait till my
mom was asleep and then force his penis into my mouth and vagina. After
he finished I'd hide under the covers and listen as he entered my
sister's room.]{.font4}

[As he rose in the pornography business his temper flared. The movies
were becoming bigger productions and he was now a director. Once I was
placed in a scene with thirty other children. The sex finale had us all
line up for an anal sex. I couldn't stop crying as the boy's penis tore
into me. My father stopped the scene, and dragged me down into a
basement room. He locked the metal door and began beating me. He ripped
off my clothes, and I felt relieved that he'd only rape me. Then I saw
the knife. Instead of cutting my throat he thrusted it into my vagina. I
don't remember the sound of my screams, but when he had finished blood
covered the floor.]{.font4}

[He wiped off the knife, and went back upstairs. He and a set man
returned, wrapped me in blankets, and brought me to his private doctor's
office. My vagina was stitched up in a clean white room, with precision
to prevent scarring. The doctor smiled a lot, told jokes and acted as if
nothing was unusual about my situation. I was home in my bed by the next
morning.]{.font4}

[His temper and cumulative violence convinced me that something was
wrong. I'd never been told that little girls didn't star in pornographic
movies and weren't supposed to be raped by their father. His pressure to
be secretive alerted me, but his violence kept me quiet.]{.font4}

[The last stage of my father's abuse involves prostitution. By fifteen
young girls are considered too old for child pornography. By then my
father had his own production company and needed young women to please
his clients. Sometimes I'd be placed in Hilton hotel rooms, but usually
in his special bedroom suite, inside the studio. The first time I was
tied up and drugged with sedatives administered by injection. The client
came in, and raped me, a glassy eyed fifteen-year-old. Soon I didn't
need to be drugged. I knew the score, either make the client happy or
not see another morning. His clients appeared to be mob related, drug
dealers and even public officials all investing in his pornographic
movies.]{.font4}

[My father's production company was a five story building complete with
screening room, offices and various studios. Three or four movies were
being made at the same time. Life inside the studio meant cocaine
covered tables, studio people armed with guns, and hidden cameras in
every room. I tried running away, attempted suicide, but never
considered telling on my father. He gave me constant reminders of his
power, but this one time convinced me I'd never escape.]{.font4}

[He led me into one of his sound proof offices. I saw two men being held
by my dad's security. My father explained that they were informers and
pulled out a revolver. He shot them in the chest, and they fell to the
carpet. "No one betrays me, " was all he said, and then his men took out
the bodies.]{.font4}

[I was three when my father began sexually abusing me. I lived through
fifteen years of pornography and three years of prostitution. I escaped
because I lived a double life, at home I was a normal middle class child
expected to attend college. The prostitutes you see on the street are
the children who couldn't escape and didn't live double lives. Over
seventy percent of all prostitutes are incest victims. The prostitute is
an abused child who found her life at home so dangerous that she turns
to the streets and stays there. She lives on the streets past her
eighteenth birthday and suddenly she is the criminal. Instead of
arresting the incest victim why doesn't the law arrest the real
criminals, the pimps and clients that continue the abuse the victim
faced in her home.]{.font4}

[These children who didn't escape also need our protection and help. The
prostitutes shouldn't be arrested, they're only trying to survive in an
abusive world. Instead of placing them in jail, educate and train the
women in constructive skills, making them accessible to other
employment. Therapy should also be offered, they will get off the
streets faster when they realize life doesn't. always have to be
abusive. Over seventy percent of the prostitutes come from similar
backgrounds to mine. If I had not been raised in a double life, in the
suburbs and not attended college, the police may have arrested me by
now.]{.font4}

[All adult survivors need access to free therapy programs. Incest
survivors have to talk and work through all their years of abuse if they
want to lead a normal life. Adult survivors are often not believed by
their families, friends and the police. The victim only \[h\]as her word
against the abuser. The abuser is seen as the minister, teacher, or
respected professional, not as a rapist or pornographer. Free therapy
clinics in every town, would give the victims the courage and validation
needed to confront their abusers. Then they need laws to prosecute and
bring their abuser to justice. The statu\[t\]e of limitations is limited
to a few years after the victim is eighteen or remembers through
therapy. A victim in therapy is reliving every time she was beaten and
raped. Therapy of this kind takes years not months, and even longer to
find the courage to face her abuser in court. There shouldn't be a
statu\[t\]e of limitations on cases of child abuse. This statu\[t\]e
only limits the rights of the abuse, while keeping pornographers and
rapists accessible to children.]{.font4}

[We can make changes to protect future children from being abused. In
kindergarten and nursery schools information programs on abuse should be
mandatory. Therapists would travel around school systems telling
children that what's happening to them at home is wrong. One on one,
these therapists could gain the child's trust, and teach them it's okay
to tell someone about the abuse. These programs should continue
throughout a child's education to save children who are abused at a
later age.]{.font4}

[Then a protection agency is required. An agency that treats the child
as an individual, not part of her abusive family. No child will tell on
a parent, if she'll have to return to that home. Agencies can't rely on
family therapy, two years of therapy doesn't guarantee a rapist will
stop attacking his child.]{.font4}

[I'm giving testimony tonight because my story is not unique. One third
of all girls, and one seventh of all boys are sexually abused before the
age of eighteen. Rational treatment programs for abused children and
adult survivors, the ending of statu\[t\]e of limitations, and realistic
protection laws will make the difference for all the children\['\]s
survival. My father has a new baby girl, and I'm fighting to find
evidence and prevent her abuse. She and other children will suffer my
childhood unless these changes are made.]{.font4}

[INDIANAPOLIS CITY-COUNTY COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE APRIL 16,
1984, 4]{.font3 .sgc-1} [P. M.]{.font3 .sgc-1}

[BEULAH COUGHENOUR, CHAIRWOMAN:.]{.font7 .sgc-1}[.. Committee of the
Council here today to consider an amendment to Chapter XVI of the Code,
Human Relations and Equal Opportunity. We have with us several people to
give expert testimony today. We will hear expert testimony, first we
will have the pro, then we will have the expert con testimony and then
we will open it to members of the public who have signed in. On the time
for those members of the public, we will probably limit this to three
minutes each in interest of the length of the meeting.]{.font4}

[At this time I would like to introduce Ms. MacKinnon, Catharine
MacKinnon\.... We welcome Ms. MacKinnon to our committee and would like
her to come forward and give the basis for this amendment. She has
defined the legal argument for sexual harassment as a legal claim for
sex discrimination, so she is well qualified today to speak to us
concerning the ordinance in our amendment. Thank you. Ms.
MacKinnon.]{.font4} 

[CATHARINE MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you,
Councilmember.]{.font4}

[I am extremely honored to be here in Indianapolis, in a place that
takes seriously the rights of women and the rights of all people
sufficient to consider that pornography should be defined as a violation
of your civil rights code.]{.font4}

[I am going to be speaking in general about the view both of sex
discrimination and of the First Amendment with which this proposal is
consistent. I will begin by submitting for more extended consideration
by the Council a transcript of the factual hearings that were held in
Minneapolis in support of a similar ordinance\....]{.font4}

[This ordinance that we have proposed defines pornography as the
sexually explicit subordination of women, graphically depicted,
whether ]{.font4}[in pictures or in words, that also includes one of a
number of other characteristics. I will first talk about the provision's
use of "sexually explicit" and "subordination of women, " and then
discuss the other characteristics.]{.sgc-6}

["Sexually explicit" is a term that has a legal history. It is not a
term that allows for the sex that is presented to be implied or left
implicit or something that the viewer might think was sex. It has to be
express\.... A normal meaning of the term subordination has to do with
being placed in a position of inferiority or loss of power. It is a way
of being denigrated or demeaned. The "subordination of women" is an
active term in this law. It is not "all depictions of" or "discussions
of" or "advocacy of" the subordination of women. To be covered, they
would have to \[be\] in fact the subordination of women. The element of
subordination, embodying as it does a concept of force or placing
someone down or in a lower status, is what is central to the way this is
a discrimination law. It is a law that is addressed to the specific
situation of the inequality of the sexes and the way\... pornography as
we define it makes the inequality of the sexes sexual, the way that it
makes sexy, the way that it eroticizes putting women in an inferior
position.]{.font4}

[The list that we then add, which must also be present, is a series of
specific items which must be in the pornography in order for it to
produce the discriminatory and violent effects that it has. The "we" in
this description that I have been saying is me and Andrea Dworkin. We
are the co-authors of this approach and of this ordinance.]{.font4}

[Each item in the definition\... is supported by both research data of
one sort or another---either laboratory, social or clinical, in fact in
all cases, all laboratory, social data or clinical data---as well as by
testimony from individuals, some of whom will be here to talk to you and
others of whom testified before the Minneapolis City Council, and their
comments are in the transcript\....]{.font4}

[The combination of sexually explicit with the subordination of women
makes this law not what lawyers may tell you it is\... merely a content
regulation. It makes it instead something that is more like other
\[restrictions\] that have been held to be legal under the First
Amendment. It's a message-medium combination. It combines what it
includes, what it ]{.font4}[says, with a way of saying it that produces
specific harms\... But anyone ]{.sgc-6}[who says this is merely a
content regulation is talking about it as if all it is, is the sub-parts
of it. The list of specific covered things, with the sexually explicit
subordination of women, is something that it is doing, not just what it
says.]{.sgc-6}

[Other things that the law is not---it is not a criminal law.
Classically, it is not censorship or a ban in a way that the state, that
is the government, is involved actively in \[taking\] actions to enforce
it. It is a civil rights law, a law that allows those people who have
been harmed by this violation to bring actions against the people who
have done that harm, including, in this case, the people who profit from
it.]{.font4}

[It is not a prior restraint,\... a law that allows \[materials\] to be
prevented from being seen before there's any legal action. It would
allow anything to be acted against only after there had been a legal
action to determine that this is in fact something that comes under the
law.]{.font4}

[It also doesn't have a single thing to do with offensiveness. Somebody
can be real offended by something and if it isn't described by this
statute, they can't do anything about it under this statute. They can
also not be offended by it, and they won't be the people to bring an
action under this law probably. You could think that this, in fact, is
something that is covered by this law and not be offended by it. In
other words, it doesn't have anything to do with subjective feeling.
What the materials either are or are not, is described by this
definition and the feelings are not central to it\....]{.font4}

[What I now want to discuss is the way in which this law makes visible a
conflict of rights between the equality rights that are guaranteed,
particularly to women, but to all people to be free from discrimination
on the basis of sex, and the rights that are guaranteed under the First
Amendment but are particularly available, in this case, to pornographers
as well as to sellers and distributors to argue that their First
Amendment rights are at stake here. The way this particular issue, I
think, is most likely to be approached judicially is for the Supreme
Court to assess the rights of women, who argue that our lives and our
opportunities including our freedom of speech and action, are
constrained and, in many cases, made impossible, flat out precluded, by
the pornography, that that will be balanced against those who argue that
the pornography is harmless, or that it is partly harmful but not
harmful enough, or that it is more important\... to preserve this
pornography as this law defines it, than it is to do anything about
whatever harms it may cause.]{.font4}

[Now, predicting how the court will cast this balance, first I will say
that anyone who tells you that this ordinance is blatantly
unconstitutional is giving you something more like a personal preference
rather than a legal analysis\-\-\--This ordinance has never been
considered by the Supreme Court, and no ordinance that is very much like
it has ever been considered by the Supreme Court---except in one case in
which a sex discrimination ordinance, a local ordinance that restricted
sex segregated ads,\... was balanced against the First Amendment rights
of the press to the commercial speech\.... And in that case, the
ordinance won. ^1^ The discrimination interest that was furthered by the
local ordinance was held to be more important than the commercial speech
interest that was recognized as existing under the First Amendment. But
other than in that case, cases and theories talk about how the Supreme
Court might balance the interests, but this particular one has never
been confronted.]{.font4}

[1. ]{.font4}[Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human
Relations 413 U. S. 376 (1973).]{.sgc-7}

[So what I am going to be doing is arguing to you that a new form of
governmental interest is what you are recognizing. You are saying the
government has recognized an interest in sex equality, and you now see
that pornography harms the equality of the sexes, and you're going to
create a civil action for people who are harmed to further the equality
of the sexes, which is something you already have a law that
recognizes.]{.font4}

[The fundamental argument about how pornography is sex discrimination is
that it is central in maintaining sex as a basis for discrimination.
What that means, concretely, is that pornography in, by, through,
because of, and in an entire cycle of abuse\... defines \[and treats\]
women as sexually subordinate beings. It defines our subordination as
our sexuality and equates that with our gender. This is something that,
as a life status, no woman completely escapes, although many women are
victimized much more specifically and intensely by it. It is also sex
discrimination because all of its victims, including men, are singled
out for the ways they are victimized on the basis of their gender. In
other words, the way men are harmed by pornography is always done to
them, through their gender. It's not the same as women, but it is
sex-specific\... The abuse is always a gender abuse. This law is
sex-specific in the way it addresses how women are specifically harmed
by pornography, and gender-neutral in its design, which allows men to
sue for injuries as well.]{.font4}

[\[Discussion of specific amendments offered to the ordinance.
\]]{.font4}

[I'll now say a couple of words about existing law and why \[this
ordinance\] is consistent with the way the First Amendment has been
interpreted. Many people believe that the First Amendment is absolute.
This is an advocacy position taken by people who wish it was. At this
point, it isn't. There are many harms, in fact, that have been found to
outweigh what is otherwise, and should be, a highly stringent guarantee
of freedom of speech.]{.font4}

[Contrasting this ordinance with existing exceptions to First Amendment
law, one finds that our definitions are a good deal more concrete and
closed-ended than numbers of definitions that have been found not vague
under the First Amendment---for example, the word indecent. In many
cases, existing sanctions are more severe than the ones we provide. That
is, they are criminal, they provide for incarceration. This does not.
Almost no existing First Amendment exception has the quantity or quality
of demonstration of concrete harm that this one does. Obscenity law, for
example, virtually assumes the harm in the face of the finding that
obscenity does not cause harm. We have here studies that show
pornography by this definition, which is not an obscenity definition,
causes concrete harms. There's an entire array of evidence that is more
substantial than virtually any demonstration that the Supreme Court has
ever had. And actually, no existing First Amendment exception recognizes
a harm of this scope, that is to say, the status of 53 percent of the
population. Or the magnitude,\... the rape, battery, sexual harassment,
forced prostitution and sexual abuse of children which can be documented
to flow from and be part of and be required in and by the pornography.
And none of it shows an industry of the size of existing adult traffic
in women, eight billion dollars, a figure that I think is both low and
old, and none of it shows anything of such wide-spread
legitimacy.]{.font4}

[You may be thinking that because pornography is so legitimate, that's a
reason why the Supreme Court won't see it as an exception to the First
Amendment. If you instead see that\... because it is so accepted, we are
treated and seen in these ways, its legitimacy becomes a demonstration
of harm, not a reason why there is no harm\....]{.font4}

[\[Account of data and Minneapolis testimony. \]]{.font4}

[A likely legal standard for measuring\... the trafficking provision may
not be whether it is scientifically valid, although, in fact, it is.
But\... whether a group like you could conclude that there is a
relationship between the evidence of all kinds and the harms that you
are trying to prevent, by allowing people to move civilly against the
people who do this. The trafficking provision, if you compare it, for
instance, with the]{.font4} [Miller]{.font4} [test of obscenity, what
harm did they find there? They found a danger of offending the
sensibilities of unwilling recipients or exposure to juveniles. What we
have here is not just a danger. We have here an actuality. And we have
not just sensibilities being offended, but physical bodies being
systematically violated. We have not just a danger of exposure to
juveniles, we have the use of adult pornography to coerce young people
into performing both for pornography and prostitution. Anyone who is
serious about doing anything about either child pornography or the
sexual abuse of children will find that you cannot do it without also
addressing adult pornography, because women are infantilized in
pornography and adult pornography is used on children. It is not a
separable abuse.]{.font4}

[There are also other legal areas which provide partial support. They
include the provisions for that speech, as they said, which by its very
utterance inflicts injury. That's called the so-called "fighting words.
" Unfortunately, to date, women have not fought for the most part, so
the things that pornography calls us have not literally been "fighting
words. " \... But words which, by their very utterance inflict injury
have been seen to be regulable. The group libel area provides some
support, and I have mentioned where the Supreme Court balanced a
discrimination interest against commercial speech, as
precedent.]{.font4}

[The Supreme Court has recognized that, in some cases, a regulation of
expression furthers the purposes of the First Amendment. That may seem
paradoxical unless you consider the ways that women have been
systematically deprived of credibility, of the ability to speak, the way
we have been silenced by pornography. Justice Stewart, in one case,
said, "when expression occurs in a setting where the capacity to make a
choice is absent, government regulation of that expression may co-exist
with, and even implement, First Amendment guarantees. "^2^ What we are
showing is a pattern of abuse where women have no choice but to live in
a world in which pornography is systematically forced on us. Even
Justice Douglas, who is an architect of the absolutist position on the
First Amendment, has stated a test which I think we have met here. He
said, "freedom of expression can be suppressed if, and to the extent
that, it is so closely brigaded with illegal action as to be an
inseparable part of it. "^3^]{.font4}

[What we are showing here, and what is documented even more concretely
in the \[Minneapolis\] hearings,\... is a way in which pornography, as
we have defined it only, is central in a cycle of abuse from which it is
inseparable. Those abuses are all actions, about which we have not been
able to do anything effective. We have not been able to guarantee
equality of the sexes\.... We have not been able to do anything about
rape, very little actually about sexual harassment. What we have is
women seen \[and treated\] as sexually inferior beings. And the
question, I think ]{.font4}[for the First Amendment, is going to be
whether the fact that it is words and pictures that are at the center of
this cycle of abuse, is going to mean that the pornographers' speech is
going to be more important than women's lives. Have I taken all my
time?]{.sgc-6}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Perhaps if you could wrap it up we could
go forward and then I'll give you a chance at the end to summarize on
the ordinance.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. You will hear people talking about
this \[ordinance\] and one of the things that they will do is attempt to
apply this to a million examples that are not sexually explicit. If the
sex is not explicit, we are not talking about this law. Very few grand
masters, old classics, all the things that everyone's going to try to
tell you are so legitimate yet would be covered by this law---on the
whole, they are not sexually explicit. What this is an attempt to do, is
to make sure that the pornography appears to you indistinguishable from
everything else. Obscenity is very difficult to distinguish from
everything else. Pornography, as defined here, is concrete and is
defined in such a way that it is not hard to distinguish from other
things. So that's an objection from obscenity law.]{.font4}

[People will also seek to evade what pornography does by saying it
doesn't do everything. Well, I haven't said it does everything. People
will say, "there was rape before the printing press. " Well, what I am
saying to you is that pornography is documented to cause the harm that
it causes. It causes a major part of these harms. I want those people to
say why we shouldn't do this, which is something *we*]{.font4}
[can]{.font4 .sgc-12} [do about rape, in addition to everything else we
can do about rape, rather than telling us it doesn't do everything. I
think they should respond to what it]{.font4} [does]{.font4 .sgc-12}
[do.]{.font4}

[You will also hear people say, "this happens just the same to other
groups. What are you making a special case about women and sex
discrimination for? " I've never understood whether they mean you
shouldn't do the right thing now because you might have to do the right
thing later, or you shouldn't do the right thing now because you might
have to do the wrong thing later. Well, courts are rather good at not
doing the wrong thing later. And in fact we're finding, with this, that
it's rather hard to do the right thing later, since there are in fact
group libel laws in some places and other laws where harms---for
instance, in the child pornography case---are seen to justify doing
something about what are otherwise people's First Amendment
rights\....]{.font4}

[Pornography does to women, because it is sexual, something that is
unlike what other literatures do to other groups of people. But\...
there are other practices that are central to the abuse of other groups
of people. ]{.font4}[For instance, in this country segregation is
central to what defines people of color as different therefore
subordinate in a way that makes it impossible to see that it's there,
unless you see it and you understand about racism. What I think
pornography does is occupies a similarly central place in the
subordination of women. It defines our status as different therefore
inferior in a way that makes our subordination just seen as our sex
characteristics, just our differences. And that is the way I think that
should be analyzed.]{.sgc-6}

[You will also hear people saying, conceding the harm, "we understand
this causes harm. That's why speech is so important. It makes people do
things. " But essentially the speech is more important\.... They are
willing to have women pay the cost for the pornographers and their
consumers' so-called freedom---which is to say, their freedom to enjoy
and profit from sexual bigotry. The fact that it can be called speech
has obscured the fact that it is not our speech. It is not women's
speech. It is the silence of women. So I'll end there. \*]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Ms. MacKinnon. We'll hear from
you a bit later. I would like to call to the podium a person who I will
call Mary to keep anonymity for her. She's a victim of incest and
pornography and she's giving voluntary testimony on the issue. She's a
client and resource person of a noted behavioral scientist and I would
like her to come forward at this time. I think you should hold the
microphone, it's a little easier to hear.]{.font4}

[MARY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Mary and I came here today because I
was a victim of child pornography at the age, that I can remember, from
three years old to fourteen. But I know I was as a baby, because I
caught my father with my two younger brothers and two younger sisters
from their first day of birth. He had two suitcases full of pornography.
One of them was like a large trunk size suitcase full, and the other
was, there was like a set of luggage with three suitcases. He used the
biggest one and when he would go to close the suitcase, it was like he,
he had to close them just like you would an over-stuffed suitcase, the
pictures stuffed inside so he would close it without them falling
out.]{.font4}

[I come from three generations of incest. My mother was a victim of it
also. There were four boys and three girls in her family. She was raised
Catholic. My father's father was a Seven\[th\]-Day Adventist minister.
My father also went on to sexually molest, in the same way he did my
sisters and brothers and myself, seven out of eleven of his own
grandchildren. My two, I wouldn't let him around them with a ten-foot
pole, the other two was born after he died.]{.font4}

[There was sodomy, there was bondage. Everything that Ms. MacKinnon has
said is true. I won't have to go into all this to save time, but I am
going to go into some very graphic details\...]{.font4}

[To start off with, I'll be 48 years old in July. My father had tied my,
I've had my feet tied, at the age of three years old, I've hung upside
down on an old coat hook, at the same time, my father has inserted
foreign objects, heated and non-heated, in me and at the same time
forced me to have oral sex with him. These people are professionals.
\[It\] was not heated to the extent to where it left any scars on the
outside, but the mental scars are with me the rest of my life. I have
been, at three years old, I've had anal intercourse, vaginal intercourse
with my father. I have been given complete ejaculations in my mouth, all
of my body, with his ejaculation into the bowels. I've had my hands and
feet tied, depending on which position my father wanted me in. I have
had my mouth taped to teach me that big girls don't cry because
everybody isn't as fortunate to have a father that will teach them the
facts of life. My father also, at the age of four years old, shared his
pornography with my babysitter across the street, and allowed me to be
used in her and her boyfriend's orgies.]{.font4}

[At ten years old, we lived across the street from a family that had a
boy and a girl. The girl and I became friends and my father was out of
town at the time. When my father was home, you're a very isolated
family, and I don't mean that you live out on the farm. You live in the
city and that, and you have houses on both sides of you. But you're a
lot more isolated than if you are living out in the country. But at the
time, I went over there and I only stayed a couple of nights. I couldn't
stay anymore because that was also an incestuous situation. There were
the father and the mother, there was pornographic magazines all over all
of the house, the girl was about my age, the boy was about a year or two
younger. And he had the same aggressive actions that his father did
towards his sister, that his father did toward his mother, and that his
father also had toward his sister and him\.... I couldn't tell nobody,
because he had tried with me, and things like this. But there was nobody
to tell because you're programmed, you're programmed very well, to know
that if you say anything, or if anybody finds out, everybody's going to
know that it was your fault, that you were the enticer.]{.font4}

[Now, logically, at 47 years old, I know a three-year-old child could
not be responsible. But in dealing with, in living with this, logic has
nothing to do with the therapy, with the overcoming, the mental anguish,
the mental everything that you have to live with. I have to this day, I
have video flashbacks of things that have happened to me. I can just be
doing normal everyday things. I don't even think about it, my father or
anything, they just come. You can't go to a phone because they don't
come at eight o'clock, twelve o'clock, and the same time every day or
they don't do this. When you have these nightmares at night and you wake
yourself up just catching yourself in time for your scream---I woke my
family up, my husband up about three times since we've been married,
screaming, because I didn't wake up in time before I did. There is no
way that society in general could excuse this.]{.font4}

[My main deal right now is that I have not been victimized as an adult,
not physically, but it's been an on-going thing mentally. It's a
life-long, traumatizing thing that never goes away. I don't \[have\] my
childhood, I don't \[have\] different stages of growing up, I couldn't
tell you the first thing about what it's like to grow up. Adulthood, it
makes it very hard for me because, I'm very blunt, I will tell you, that
it's been over five years since I have been able to have any sexual
things with my husband. I can't handle it. There never has been that
much contact. My sisters and brothers have all been, they've been
prostitutes, drug addicts, alcoholics, my nieces and nephews, they're
messed up. I've never been able to turn to drugs or alcohol or
prostitution or anything. I don't know why. It don't make me any better,
any stronger, or anything. I just never could.]{.font4}

[But this last four years I've been \[fortunate\] coming into contact
with a Dr. Frank O'Sanka---he's a behavioral consultant of Napierville,
Illinois---and fortunate to be a very small part of what he does in
traveling around and doing seminars and things like this. And it
backfired, because I thought I would be able to give more than I
receive. Well, it backfired, because this has been the only good therapy
I've ever had in my life. And I tend to receive more than I
give.]{.font4}

[Now even though any one of you out here have never been direct victims,
don't mean you aren't victims. All of you in society are indirect
victims\....]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mary, I think we'll have to go
forward now because we have to get done within some kind of time limit.
Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[MARY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [But I want to thank you all for coming and I
hope you get out there and do something and stop the pornography because
otherwise---I want to say one thing. They keep saying that you can't
legislate morality. Well, I don't know why not, because they have been
legislating immorality for years and look where it's got us. Thank you
all very much.]{.font4} 

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to call a lady called Judy,
who's the mother of a twelve-year-old girl who was repeatedly victimized
over a four year period by a man who was using pornography
extensively.]{.font4}

[JUDY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I don't how much weight I can add to this for
you other than the fact that I would like to let you know that I am a
concerned parent. Our daughter was a victim of sexual assault for a
period of four-and-a-half years. And when this man was arrested in our
home, found in his car, in the trunk of his car, was a considerable
amount of pornpgraphic material. Our child is not in our home. This was
so traumatic for her that she had to be hospitalized and probably will
not be in our home for another year, which means that, as a victim, she
was removed from our home for a period of over two years. The
perpetrator---we did press charges---he spent one year in jail, and is
now out, while our child is still not at home. I am a concerned parent
and I would like you to look at this real closely.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much. I would next like to
call to testify Detective Terry Hall, an IPD detective with sex offenses
unit.]{.font4}

[TERRY HALL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Good evening, my name is Detective Terry
Hall with the Indianapolis Police Department. I was asked to come here
today to give you a little bit of insight into my investigations as a
sex crimes investigator\.... I'll try my best to give you some examples
\[of\] how pornography has come under my investigations. Quite a few
rape investigations that I have conducted, especially where there was
violence, upon arresting the suspect, I find that there were hard-core
pornography in the suspect's house or in the suspect's car. I've had
several rape victims, especially, it seems, to always be the more
violent rapes, where the rape victim was made to look at pornography
while the rape was occurring. I think I'm not qualified to say whether
this started the rape or whether the rape would have been done without
the pornography. I'm just telling you that when I make my investigation,
especially on the more brutal ones, usually there's pornography,
hard-core pornography, there showing something like sado-masochist or
bestiality\.... I've had a large amount of pornography used by adults to
school young girls in the sexual acts. I have recently investigated a
case where a ten-year-old boy was being sexually abused by
seventeen-year-old boys who used pornography and expecting certain
sexual acts that they wanted him to do. I've also had a family, complete
family, that used pornography and I started working on a molestation
that was with a father and went all the way down through the children
where extensive pornography was used, even over into uncles and
cousins.]{.font4}

[The lady that was just up here previously is one of the most
devastating cases to my estimation that I have ever had to investigate.
It took a personal toll on my life as fourteen years as a police
officer. I would like to expand on that case a little bit. The person
that did this molestation was not a crumb bum, which most people think
people who deal in pornography are low-stature-type people. This man was
a prominent Indianapolis attorney who used the pornography to school and
indoctrinate this child into thinking that everything she done was okay.
And when I got to the child, she did think everything she done was okay,
because, as she stated, that it was in the books, and children are
taught to read and taught to pay attention to books from a very early
age. Because this man was a very educated man, he was an attorney, it
was very easy for him, with the help of visual aids---and we all know
that lecture is probably the worst way to convey any type of educational
material and that visual aids is one of the best---this visual aid that
was used was pornography. I'm not talking about just a little bit of
pornography, meaning hard-core magazines. Films were used, the child was
made to have a type of sex with an animal, and a lot of other things
that I'm sure that I don't need to go into here. All of it was copied
from or directly out of a book, just like they was depicted in the book.
It wasn't anything innovative or anything he made up. It was directly by
the book. When I arrested the man, in the people's home, he had cameras
and instamatic pictures of the girl committing sex acts on him. This
girl was eight years old when this started and when I opened the trunk
of his car, he had around three hundred hard-core magazines with
pornographic pictures in them.]{.font4}

[I just would like to think that this probably wouldn't have happened
with this or maybe the girl would've caught on if he couldn't point out
that everyone was doing this and this was a natural thing to do. I guess
I'm not qualified to say that. However, it makes one think, especially
when I keep running into these cases where I arrest the suspect and I
find so much pornography, hard-core pornography, around, especially
showing abuse and pain to the victim of the sexual attack. That's about
all I had to say unless there's any questions.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are there any questions of the Committee?
Thank you very much. As a final witness for this or to testify for the
ordinance, Deborah Daniels from the Prosecutors' Office.]{.font4}

[DEBORAH DANIELS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Madam Chairman, Members of
the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you. My testimony
is really two-fold. I'll begin by presenting the testimony of T. V., who
is a local counselor to persons in the community. She had to be out of
town and could not be present\.... She titles it "Women in Pornography.
"]{.font4}

> [In ten years of counseling with men and women, I have had several
> incidents with clients where pornography played a great part in the
> violence that ensued in their lives. It would seem that the need to be
> violent, to get retribution for whatever pain and anguish is going on
> in these men's lives, is often enhanced by pornographic literature. I
> am reminded of a case in particular in which a woman had been married
> for fourteen years, during the last ten years of which, pornographic
> literature had been a large part of her husband's sexual arousement.
> He would look at the pornographic literature, then come to her, wake
> her up, beat her, then demand she perform acts depicted in the
> literature. There were times when this behavior was as violent as
> cutting her with a razor, slapping, hitting and kicking her, tying her
> to the end of the bed and requiring her to do demeaning sexual acts
> involving other people, as well as her mate. It may seem unusual that
> this woman stayed with this man, but those of us who have worked with
> women who have been involved \[in\] violent sexual encounters
> understand that fear becomes the main element in such a woman's life
> that demeaning responses that she has had to give make her very fear
> filled and very much afraid to leave a relationship. There are always
> threats along with this, such as the "if you don't do this, I will\...
> " kind of thing. As a result, she becomes the typical battered woman,
> only more so. Fear takes over as the primary element of her life, and
> she can't find a way to get loose from the relationship. Another
> incident that recently came to my attention was a woman who came to me
> because she was to marry a man who had been a Viet Nam war veteran.
> She was quite terrified because this man had performed violent acts of
> sex with her. He told her that the only \[way\] he could be sexually
> active with her was to read pornographic material and get his anger up
> again. When his anger was up, through violence and pornographic
> material (books and other written material, not movies), then he could
> perform. Otherwise, he couldn't. He would bring home pornographic
> literature, make her read it with him, then perform acts of
> violence.]{.font4}

[She then mentions that the whole Vietnam issue needs to be looked at
closely and that those men have had a terrible experience.]{.font4}

> [The third incident that recently happened was a woman who became a
> rape victim. Before the rapist involved himself, he put her through
> demeaning, sexual, violent actions, twisted her body in unbelievable
> shapes and tied her legs and hands together. He forced her to have sex
> with an animal. He marked X's on her back, shaved her, then showed her
> pictures from pornographic magazines, all the time performing sex acts
> upon himself, then raped her. He placed her in disfiguring positions,
> such that she found it impossible to free herself. He laughed a great
> deal and pointed to the pictures, say\[ing\], "this is how it ought to
> be with women. " In another incident, a man said to me when I
> confronted him with his sexual behavior, that the only way to take
> care of a woman (which he learned through reading books in shopping
> centers and then throwing them away) is to beat her up one side and
> down the other, to make her get dressed up in black stockings and high
> heels, to make her wear men's clothing, all kinds of deviant behavior.
> "I read these magazines, then throw them in the trash in shopping
> centers. " As I said before, the effect of this kind of behavior on
> women is pathetic in that it begins the strong, battered woman
> complex, and she finds it virtually impossible to break herself from
> the relationship. I have worked with three women coerced into
> prostitution at a "respectable" level. By that I mean prostitution for
> private men's clubs. In each of these three cases, the woman entered a
> relationship with a man, believing that it was a stable relationship,
> only to find after a month or two that the man engaged in unacceptable
> sexual behavior. Each of the three women was demeaned by this behavior
> to the extent that she was unable to free herself. The man in each
> case acted as a pimp. He took the woman to men's clubs, provided
> pornographic literature, then required the woman to dance and perform
> acts to satisfy the desires of other men. Each of the women was made
> to do the kinds of things described in pornographic magazines. Each of
> these women is now free of these relationships and prostitution. It is
> erroneous to think that pornographic literature is simply erotic. More
> than the sexual act, it raises the level of violence in an

[The remainder of my testimony will deal with basically the harm issue.
A lot of people are asking why the Marion County Prosecutor's Office is
involved in furthering this amendment at all. It is not, as Professor
MacKinnon indicated, a law enforcement tool. It is not something in
which the Prosecutor's Office will be involved directly at all. It
provides for a civil action in which people can go to court\.... The
reason that we are very interested in the dialogue on this issue is that
there's been a lot of talk for a long time about the general issues
involving pornography or obscenity, and the idea that what people
interested in limiting this material are doing is trying to force their
morality onto other people. What we are very interested in, with this
approach, is that it focuses the discussion on the real harm that
results to women from this kind of material\.... \[discussion of
empirical effects of pornography\] I would say that Dr. Donnerstein, to
whom I keep referring, who is a Ph. D. in Psychology with the University
of Wisconsin, is a leading authority in the area. He unfortunately could
not be with us today. He is at this time planning on being available
next Monday to answer any questions if in fact this proceeds out of
committee today and goes to the Council. He will be present at the
meeting in case anyone has any questions and he will be available that
day to answer any questions\....\*]{.font4}

[\*]{.font4}[Dr. Donnerstein was present and answered questions from
Council members on June 4, 1984. No transcript of this hearing is
available. Professor MacKinnon was not present. At that time, lawyers
for Indianapolis introduced into the Administrative Committee record a
transcript of a telephone interview that Catharine MacKinnon had
previously conducted with Dr. Donnerstein. It is reproduced in Appendix
A.]{.sgc-7}

[To bring this a little closer to home, there was a recent case in which
Deborah Weaver returned home to find a burglar in her house. I'm sure
you all read about this in the papers. It was only last week. The fellow
who was arrested as her alleged killer gave a confession to the police
in which he stated that on the day of the killing, he visited several
adult bookstores. Now\... \[I can't say that\] \[break in soundtrack\]
what he carried over with him into the house directly caused this act. I
will say that he went into the house, unscrewed, according to his
statement to the police, unscrewed the light bulbs in the house so that
it would be totally dark, and waited for the victim to return home. When
she did, he sexually assaulted her, tortured her, according to his
statement, and brutally murdered her. I make reference to this simply to
give you an idea, I can't say for sure what the correlation is, but he,
in his own statement, indicated that he had been reading pornographic
material.]{.font4}

[I would like to make reference to some of the material we're talking
about. Frankly, I didn't know until fairly recently what we're talking
about, because I'm not a consumer of pornography myself. I felt that it
was necessary, in order to prepare my testimony, to look at some of the
materials that had been purchased by the Indianapolis Police Department
Vice Branch recently, this year, in Indianapolis. I'd like to read you
some of the titles of the magazines and their stories. One magazine is
called "Bound to Tease. " I think that's self-explanatory. One is called
"Bondage Fever, " and two of the stories in it are called "Unwilling
Submission" and "Raging Restraint. " Another magazine is called "Tied Up
Tarts, " with a subtitle, "Girls Who Love to Submit. " One of the story
titles is "Alma's Secret Fantasy. " Basically the story-line has to do
with a woman who hated to "admit it" but she learned that she enjoyed
bondage and discipline, as they call it. Another story in that
particular magazine is called "Bound and Beautiful. " Another magazine
is called "Restraint. "]{.font4}

[The stories involve "Tanya Learns the Ropes, " "Tanya's Initiation into
the Exotic Joys of Bondage. " I read this story, and those who say that
we should perhaps limit the ordinance to visual depictions, perhaps I
should address this story. This particular story, though most of the
magazine had graphic pictures of women, nude women, tied up in obvious
expressions of pain, now this particular story didn't have any pictures,
but it was all about a woman who had described herself, supposedly, at
the outset of the story as an avid women's-libber, and she said that
she'd never had a good sexual relationship with anyone because she was
accustomed to going out with what she called wimps who respected her.
She went to apply for a job one day, this is billed as a true story,
written in the first person, supposedly, by this woman. She went to
apply for a job one day, and who should appear at the door but Dirk, who
appeared to be an obvious large, hairy, masculine, ferocious-looking
man. Basically, he took her into his study for the job interview, bound
her up, though she screamed and was frightened to death, and began to
torture her. The whole story line indicates that she told him she was
scared, and she told him she didn't want to do any of this, and she told
him it hurt, and she asked him and begged him to stop and yet, the
storyline indicates that secretly she loved it. Secretly, she was
aroused and it was the most wonderful experience of her life. This tends
to be the story that is retold and retold in this literature. And at the
end of the story, of course, she describes herself as the man's willing
slave. All she wants is to do any humiliating tasks he assigns to her.
She has learned her lesson.]{.font4}

[Another story in the same magazine is called "The Rich Bitch, " and it
was about teaching a snobbish female who, this man had felt, ~r~ put him
down in the past, a lesson, by binding her to the wall with chains and
inflicting physical pain upon her. The last sentence indicated that,
rather than Sally is now going to go the Prosecutor's Office and file
charges against Frank, it said, Sally, from now on, will treat Frank
more special because he\'s taught her a lesson.]{.font4}

[Finally, two more magazines. One is entitled "Tied Up. " And there's a
story in it called "Bound Bitch, " and there's a lot of reference to
bitches, tarts, whores, women who deserve this sort of treatment.
Another is titled "Black Bondage. " The two stories featured in the
magazine, in this particular issue, were called "Black Bitches: Bound,
Gagged, and Loving It. " And the second was "Roped and Raped.
"\...]{.font4}

[Some\... suggest that perhaps education, public education, may be the
cure. Many other civil libertarians also suggest that \[what will cure\]
the problem is "more speech, "---you know, you can solve this problem by
talking to it. We would suggest that there is no effective way---unlike
in a laboratory situation where you can debrief your subjects---to reach
all those persons who are exposed to pornography and convince them that
the justification for the violence presented in those films, magazines,
and other materials, is not real or valid. And that is why we support
the ordinance as an innovative way to approach a real problem. Thank you
for your attention.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Miss Daniels. And now we have
those who would like to testify against the proposed amendment.
Representing the ACLU, Mr. Bill Marsh.]{.font4}

[BILL MARSH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Madam Chairman\.... The Indiana
Civil Liberties Union emphatically endorses the policy declaration of
this proposal which states that discrimination on the basis of sex is
contrary to the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity. For
many, many years, the Indiana Civil Liberties Union has been a vocal
advocate of freedom and equal opportunity for women. In a recent article
in the September 1983 issue of]{.font4} [Judicature]{.font4} [magazine,
two Emory University professors presented a study which concluded that
the American Civil Liberties Union, our national organization, emerged
as the representative of women before the United States Supreme Court.
The efforts of the ACLU have been successful on behalf of women. This
study also found that the ACLU's presence in a case increased the
chances of success for a gender-based claim by sixteen percent.]{.font4}

[However, despite our continued strong support of new initiatives to
bring real equality to women, the Indiana Civil Liberties Union urges
you to reject Proposal 228 because the Proposal presents too great a
danger to the free expression of ideas. The ICLU does not support
pornography, and I personally loathe pornography, but we must be
ever-vigilant to the protection of ideas, not only those ideas we
support, but those that we loathe as well.]{.font4}

[This proposal would result in the suppression of ideas, not just
pornography, but constitutionally protected ideas, in several ways.
Several aspects of this proposal would lend to significant
self-censorship by bookstore operators, not only adult bookstores, but
all bookstores in Marion County. Those provisions in the ordinance which
would have that effect are as follows.]{.font4}

[One, the definition of pornography is so vague that the individual
bookstore operators will not be able to make an accurate assessment of
whether a particular item is pornographic or not. And Ms. MacKinnon made
strong reference to the point that there are specifics in the definition
of pornography, but I would point out to you that I am referring to the
portion of the definition which describes pornography as the sexually
explicit subordination of women. A bookstore operator who's deciding
what to sell and what not to sell will have to decide what that means,
and I suggest to you that it's going to be extremely difficult for them
to do that and they will opt in favor of self-censorship rather than run
the risks of this ordinance.]{.font4}

[Number two, the ordinance specifically provides that the bookseller is
strictly liable for the contents of everything she sells. The prudent
bookstore owner will only sell those items about which she has personal
knowledge.]{.font4}

[Number three, the definition of pornography can be applied to isolated
passages in written material, whether pictures or words. This means that
the bookstore operator will not be secure simply knowing the general
theme or general tenor of a piece. She will be at peril anytime she
sells an item which she has not read thoroughly.]{.font4}

[Number four, any person believing that any isolated passage found in a
publication in a bookstore in Marion County can first file a complaint
with the Office of Equal Opportunity of the Indianapolis Corporation
Council and number two, file a cause of action for damages in a court in
Marion County. And I would add to emphasize the point, members of the
Committee, that we are not concerned about the kind of material which
Ms. Daniels just graphically described to you.]{.font4}

[We are concerned about the impact which this ordinance would have on
legitimate constitutionally-protected material in legitimate bookstores
in Marion County. The manager of the bookstore at the university where I
teach told me that there are several titles in his bookstore which he
would remove if this ordinance was passed, not because he knows that
they\'re illegal under this ordinance but because he doesn't know and
he's not willing to run the risk. And those were textbooks which are
used in university courses. George Orwell would likely perceive, if this
ordinance is passed, swarms of Marion County residents, motivated by
money or morality, descending upon the bookstores of Marion County in
search of pornography. Every time this search proves successful to the
satisfaction of the individual citizen, the bookstore owner, manager and
cash register clerk will be called into court and/or called before the
Indianapolis Corporation Council to defend the material. The outcome of
the litigation, I suggest to you, will be largely irrelevant, because
the time and expense involved in defending such a charge will consume
any profit which the bookstore operator might realize. The cautious
bookstore operator, in a traditional establishment bookstore, will
likely opt to significantly restrict her inventory to decrease the risk
of liability. Her action will also severely restrict free expression of
ideas in this county.]{.font4}

[Now the cover page of your proposal indicates that your attorney has
not yet rendered an opinion as to the constitutionality of this
proposal. Since you have each taken an oath to support and defend the
Constitution, you should ask your attorney for an opinion of the
constitutionality, because this ordinance is, without question,
unconstitutional. When you request this opinion, specifically ask your
attorney these questions. First, isn't this proposal contrary to the
teachings of Marbury against Madison?]{.font4} [Marbury]{.font4} [has
been an integral part of our system of government since 1803 and has
been reaffirmed by the current United States Supreme Court in Nixon
against the United States in 1974.]{.font4} [Marbury]{.font4} [provides
that the Supreme Court of the United States is the ultimate interpreter
of the Constitution and government at all levels is bound by that
interpretation. The Supreme Court has drawn a line between
constitutionally protected sexually explicit material and material which
is not protected. The definition of pornography in the proposal is much
different and is more restrictive than that provided by the Supreme
Court.]{.font4}

[Secondly, ask your attorney, doesn't this proposal violate Smith
against California? In this case, the United States Supreme Court held
that strict liability or eliminating the knowledge element violates the
First Amendment because, and I quote, "\[it\] tends to impose a severe
limitation on the public's access to constitutionally protected matter.
" Not pornography, it tends to restrict access to constitutionally
protected matter.]{.font4}

[Thirdly, ask your attorney this question: isn't this proposal contrary
to Chief Justice Burger's admonition that the material must be taken as
a whole and that it can be censored only if it does not have serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value? Next, ask your
attorney this: doesn't the empowering of a censorship board, which is
now known as the Office of Equal Opportunity, doesn't the empowering of
this board to issue cease and desist orders and show cause orders
violate the constitutional procedural requirements established by
Friedman against Maryland?]{.font4}

[And fifth, please ask your attorney this: isn't it true that the United
States Supreme Court has held that civil remedies, which this proposal
contains, as well as criminal sanctions are subject to the limitations
of the First Amendment? And my written statement cites three cases in
which the Supreme Court has done exactly that. After months of study,
the Minneapolis City Attorney concluded that the ordinance proposed
there, which is basically the same ordinance you're considering, is
unconstitutional, and I am confident that your attorney will reach the
same conclusion.]{.font4}

[In closing, let me say this, and emphasize this point. Regardless of
the fate of this proposal, the Indiana Civil Liberties Union will
continue to be in the forefront of the crusade for the eradication of
sex discrimination from our society. In our zeal to achieve this
essential goal, however, we must, and we will, maintain our commitment
to the free expression of ideas which is the cornerstone of our
democracy. All of our liberties, I respectfully submit to you, are
dependent on the diligent protection of free expression. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would now like to call John Wood, an
attorney with the firm of Bamburger and Fibelman.]{.font4}

[JOHN WOOD:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Members of the Committee and Council, my

interest in this, primarily I'm appearing in a capacity as a former

the drafting of the First UNIGOV Ordinance which created the Commission
in 1970. I worked with Harriet Kahn at that time, the late Harriet Kahn,
who was a member of the city legal staff. And that was the first
ordinance which actually created the Commission which had some
enforcement powers to deal with the whole range of discriminatory
practices which were covered under the Indiana Civil Rights Act. And
Mayor Luger then appointed me as the first chairman of that Commission.

[McGRATH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I move we continue studying this proposal and
would move to table this for further study.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Does that, do you mean, are you sending
this back to Committee, is that what you're saying?]{.font4}

[McGRATH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, I believe it is still in Committee, so
my motion would be to continue to study in Committee.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right, and did you second that, Mr.
Hawkins? It's been moved and seconded. Any discussion? All in favor say
aye.]{.font4} 

[STRAITER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Miss Chairman, I really need to ask the
counselor an opinion. I think that this needs to go before the full
Council and I would be the last to want to be destroyed by the news
media in terms of being wishy-washy or what have you, so I would hate to
ask that it go to---and the only way that I know of to get it to the
full Council is to recommend it to the full Council with a "do pass. "
And I'm not ready at this point to vote yes. But I am ready for it to
get, you know, we've been talking about juries and I think it needs its
day in court, and in order for it to have its day in court, it's got to
go before our entire body. Now what other way do we have, or do I just
have to sit up and say, sitting with a "do pass, " when Monday I might
not want to vote for it and then everybody say, well why did you send it
out with a "do pass"?]{.font4}

[McGRATH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I suppose one answer to that question is,
this Committee is scheduled to meet again on Thursday. If Mr. McGrath's
motion carries, it could be taken off the table at that
Committee.]{.font4}

[CHAIRWOMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It's possible. There is other business
that we had hopefully scheduled that day. However, I understand how Mr.
Straiter feels. I think I've heard a lot of people, maybe not too often,
but many times, after more discussion and more evidence is presented,
people have voted differently in the full Council than they have in
Committee. I don't think our Committee votes are binding. I understand
your intent and I certainly would understand where you were coming from.
I feel that it deserves its day in court and I think that we probably,
as a Committee, are not going to hear that much more different
testimony. And perhaps the whole Council does deserve the right to give
it their support or dis-support\....]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I would like to do, if it's all right
with you, is ask you a few questions about some of the specifics of
them, particularly as they bear on your research, including not only the
research you presented while you were here, but some of the other things
that people have raised since you were here.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, no problem at all. I would be happy
to.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. One document that was a letter that
was used by the Mayor---he referred to it as a partial basis for his
veto of the ordinance--- is a letter from an Ira L. Reiss, Professor of
Sociology here at the University of Minnesota. Do you know Mr. Reiss?
Are you familiar with his work?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Not familiar with his work. He has
corresponded with me over the years, basically in terms of asking for
reprints of certain articles which we have done, which I obviously have
sent him like we send everybody else. And I also met him at the
testimony there, the day I testified and spoke to him briefly afterwards
about some of our newer research which he did not have a copy of at that
point.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So, he---your impression is that he was at
the hearing such that he heard you testify?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, I\'m pretty sure, yes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Because after you spoke, he asked
you---]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, he had come up and introduced
himself and then of course the name rang a bell because he had
communicated with me, you know, really over the years asking for
reprints and other types of things.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, one of the things he says in this
letter is that he is familiar with the research by you, Malamuth, and
others in the area of pornography and says "I feel that it was not
clearly presented at the hearing. The key point that was omitted from
the hearing was the basic support the current research gives to the
findings of the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography
presented in 1970. That Commission reported that pornography was not
shown in the various research they had reviewed to lead to criminal
sexual conduct. Donnerstein also basically agrees with that finding. "
And then he quotes from you. He says, "The quote from Donnerstein in his
1983 chapter 'Erotica and Human Aggression' from R. Dean and E.
Donnerstein, editors,]{.font4} [Aggression: Theoretical and Empirical
Reviews]{.font4} [\[Academic Press, 1983\], p. 138, " and then he quotes
from you, "Once again then, there is no evidence that exposure to
nonviolent erotica will increase aggression against women. " Could you
comment on that characterization of your work in general?]{.font4}
[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, there's a couple things. One, even
though it's a 1983 chapter, which might sound like yesterday, I think
one has to realize that in the academic community most things are
written four or five years before. So in terms of that particular quote,
a couple of things: (1) we did say that exposure to nonviolent erotica
will not increase aggression against women. I think there is two things
important to bring out. One, what we mean by nonviolent erotica. I mean,
there has been a lot of misunderstanding of what we're doing. We
specifically create films which are sexually explicit but do not contain
coercion, differential power, subordination, degradation---anything of
that nature against women. They are sexually explicit. We do that to
bring out the point that at least in the research that we were doing
with short-term exposure, it is the violent element which leads to the
effects in the short-term. Now, there are a number of important things
here. One if we talk about nonviolent erotica in terms of the types of
material we used---it is an artificial material. It is specifically
created for experimental purposes. It is not the type of material which
one would, let's say, normally find in an adult bookstore. It might be
the type of material which perhaps \[one\] would use as a sex therapist,
or in a sex education class, perhaps.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So might that be more likely to be the
materials which he as a sexologist would be familiar with?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, of course, yes. And it is material
which we pretty much created for experimental purposes. Now if one
begins, however, in that particular chapter we mention that what needs
to be looked at is of course long-term exposure to material which is not
explicitly violent, in other words no graphic physical violence against
women but which begins to deal with the trivialization of women, the
objectification of women. And of course since this chapter has appeared,
or really since it was written, which was around 1980---and it takes
two, three years for the publishers to publish them---there has
obviously been a lot of other research done on long-term exposure to
nonviolent material but material which basically places women in
submissive roles, unequal power roles, basically which trivializes women
and that's in some of our newer work and newer chapters, which by the
way are already published, and also in some of the work by Dolf
Zillmann. What that research shows---]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7
.sgc-1} [Isn't it also the case that that research is based on actual
films rather than experimentally made films?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yeah. In fact, ---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you discuss the differences between
films made with the express purpose of removing force and films that are
actually available films now on the market?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In the research which we have been doing
now, and the research which Zillmann has been doing, films are taken off
the general market and used as they are. There is no editing. In the
initial experimental research which Reiss refers to we took those same
films but completely cut them apart and re-edited them with scenes which
would only be sexually explicit without any of these dynamics in it
involved. You can't, you can't find the films, okay, in the adult
bookstore which meets the criteria of just simply sexually explicit
without creating any changes in attitudes and so forth and so on---it's
something we create. I think that must be clearly understood. But if you
get to the commercially released material, even though it might not be
explicitly violent, that is physical violence, what you find is that
with long-term exposure, yes you don't get changes necessarily in
aggressive behavior but what you get are changes in people's attitudes
about women, the perception of rape, perceptions of violence in general.
You get a trivialization of women, you get a change toward an increase
in callous attitudes towards women. And I think it's important to
mention the Pornography Commission which I think you mentioned he
referred to, did a study in which subjects were exposed to this type of
material---I think ten minutes worth---and then their attitudes towards
women were tested on a scale called the Sex-Callousness Scale, which is
some fairly degrading statements regarding women, and they found no
effect. However, in recent research by Zillmann in Indiana which is now
out and is fairly well-known---even though it came out a year ago in the
scientific journals---shows that with six weeks of exposure to this
material, with really only a couple of hours a week which really isn't
that much, by the way, you do find an increase in the Sex-Callousness
Scale attitudes. In the research that we have been doing now for the
National Science Foundation, which was just released, a preliminary
report in the January issue of Psychology Today and which is now being
written up for scientific journals, we also find with long-term
exposure, changes of attitudes towards women, a trivialization of rape,
seeing women as more worthless if they've been the victim of rape, so
forth and so on. The issue here doesn't have to be an issue of does
exposure to this material lead to aggressive behavior. The violent
material leads to aggressive behavior. The nonviolent but commercially
released type of material tends to affect people's attitudes about
women, perceptions of women. Now whether or not that eventually spills
over to aggressive behavior, one will have to determine from additional
research. But, I think it's wrong to say that what we have said is that
material which is not violent, physically violent, has no effect. That
isn't the case at all. We have created, again, a very specific type of
material to demonstrate to the scientific community that it is not the
sexual explicitness in aggressive pornography which is the issue. It is
one, in our early research, the aggressiveness against women, and now in
our newer research and that by Dolf Zillmann, the role of women in the
particular films. I think everybody has tried to point out sexual
explicitness is not the issue. In that sense I agree with Reiss. It is
not the issue.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [But, if I remember correctly---as I
mentioned to you I had not read your bill beforehand, okay, because I
try to stay out of the legal issues and try to stay neutral in this, but
I did take a look at it afterwards and correct me if I'm wrong I don't
think sexually explicitness was your issue either in any of
this.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No, \[not by itself\].]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So, I think there is a little
misunderstanding in what the research shows. Okay. And I think now it is
quite obvious that the newer research demonstrates with even nonviolent
material, but material which subordinates women or makes women
submissive or strictly sexual objects, you do get changes in
attitudes---attitudes which, by the way, the Pornography Commission
looked for but did not find and the reason they didn't find it is that
with that type of material, it is not going to happen overnight. I think
it's ludicrous for us to think you change somebody after 18 years with
ten minutes of exposure. It takes a little longer.]{.font4}
[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In terms of the relationship between the
attitude changes you have just been discussing and possible propensities
for say rape---]{.font4} [DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you talk about the work of Neil
Malamuth and the rape propensity predictions from the Rape
Scale?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. In fact, one thing one can do with
known rapists, and again known rapists are a difficult population to
deal with---I'm going to even criticize myself at this point, because I
think in a sense it points to a lot of research that other people have
brought up suggesting rapists have no exposure to the material, it
doesn't have an effect. The problem is that they are a very unique
population and a convicted rapist whom you have studied represents one
out of every 500 rapes committed. So I think we have to keep that in
mind. But even among those rapists, you can predict, for instance,
recidivism based on their attitudes towards rape, and their sexual
arousal to certain types of material. Now what Malamuth has shown is
that in normal subjects, that is non-rapists as far as we know, if you
know their attitudes towards rape, towards women, and their sexual
arousal to certain types of pornography you can predict quite good
statistically their aggressive behavior against women in laboratory type
situations. So, if certain material, whether it is violent or nonviolent
material increases or changes people's attitudes about women, about
rape, then that can lead to aggressive behavior. What that suggests, I
think very strongly, is that with the nonviolent material, the
non-physically violent material, there are individual differences,
meaning yes, it doesn't affect 100 percent of the people---Nobody has
ever said that, okay? ---but for instance we know, in the general male
population, this is from the research of Malamuth and I think I
discussed this at the hearing, that anywhere between 25 and 30 percent
of normal males have the propensity to rape to begin with. That's a lot.
That's an incredible amount, okay? Those people are very much affected
by this type of material. And it tends to reinforce their attitudes and
conceptions of women. The material doesn't have to be graphically
violent, it can be material which plays into the common stereotypes we
have\' about women.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Which they perhaps may have already gotten
from, is it fair to say, from exposure to previous pornography?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Exposure to previous pornography, I think
exposure to the media in general. I think the problem of course is what
the material is doing is definitely not catharting those attitudes away.
Okay. If it is not causing and creating it, it is without question
maintaining and reinforcing and for a certain percentage it might be
that particular stimulus which activates violent behavior. I think we
are always a bit---and I hate to use the word misguided---but in a sense
we are by thinking unless \[we have\] hundreds and hundreds of thousands
of people there is no problem. I think one has to think that if it is
even one or two percent who are affected to commit violent crime and a
certain material has a distribution of a couple of million, I don't
think you have to be a statistician to figure out what's going on, not
only to the victim, which in this case would be women primarily, but to
the society in general. And we know there are certain people who are
very much predisposed who the material drastically affects.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right. But it's also true, isn't it, that
your recent experiments are principally on normals?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yes. And I think there again, a lot
of this research is quite new and I wouldn't expect Professor Reiss and
the others to be aware of it. It has just been published in a
preliminary form, although the National Science Foundation has access to
it because it is funded by them.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [But you did present it at the
hearing.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [We did present it at the hearing. That
research of course shows that even with the most normal individuals who
we could possibly find who are screened because they are classified as
normal as possible, show changes in their perceptions of women, their
perceptions of rape. That doesn't mean, again, that they are going to go
out and commit a rape. Nobody can do that research. But it definitely
shows their attitude about women, their attitudes about rape, are being
changed.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And that also included,
if I recall correctly, that they were radically less likely to see as
rape an account---\[of a rape\]?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yes, yes. And in fact they sit in the
University of Wisconsin Law School courtroom in a jury box and watch a
reenactment of an actual case and see less violence occurring to the
woman, are less likely to convict, see the woman as more responsible for
her rape, see her as more worthless, etc., etc.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And that's with what you call X-only
material?]{.font4} 

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [X-only material, yes. Arid again the
X-only material in this research that we are doing now is different from
the "nonviolent erotica" we've used before. Unfortunately, we have used
the same terms and that's a problem I think in the academic community in
terms of how we operationalize things. But the material we use in the
newer research is commercially released unedited material. We did not do
anything with it.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to
read you a sentence from Mr. Reiss' letter because I think what you just
said, if you state it in terms of what he said, would clarify
something.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He said, "Donnerstein uses films depicting
rape in much of his experiments on violent pornography. In one of his
most recent experiments, he used mostly college males and exposed some
of them to nonviolent erotica, some to violent erotica, some to a
violent nonerotic film and some to a neutral film. Then he looked for
differences in the willingness of each group of subjects to administer
electric shocks to a woman confederate in the experiment who had
previously deliberately angered the subjects. He found that the violent
nonerotic film increases the willingness to administer shocks to a woman
and that the nonviolent erotic film does not show such an increase. It
is true that when you add the erotic and the violent in one film there
is an even greater willingness to administer shock but it is clear to
him that 'the more crucial factor' is the aggression shown in the film.
" And then he goes on to say, "The key findings here is that the
nonviolent erotic films does not increase shocks and that only with the
addition of violence is there any increase in shocks administered to
females. Despite these findings, Donnerstein's testimony is used to
promote the new pornography law which would put in jeopardy precisely
those types of films he found not to increase aggression towards women.
"]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, a couple things. Again, one, we are
researchers and theoreticians, the initial research we did was on what
we labeled aggressive pornography, that is, films in which women are
sexually assaulted which are not that uncommon, by the way. Okay. Now
what we tried to do as I mentioned earlier was to demonstrate that it
was not the sexual explicitness in that material, aggressive
pornography, which leads to increases in aggression, it is the
aggression or a combination. Consequently, as I mentioned earlier, we
created films which were strictly sexually explicit, okay. Now in that
sense I agree with Reiss. For aggressive pornography it is the
aggression okay, not the sexual explicitness and the juxtaposition of
the two is worse. But everybody would agree with that. Now what we've
been doing as other researchers have been doing is say, now let's move
away from the "aggressive pornography" into the more commercially
released type of material which is sexually explicit but goes beyond
that. It gets away from what would normally be defined as erotica and
that is an equal relationship, no submissiveness, domination,
degradation, etc., etc., okay, in the material, but is the common type
of fare which is out there. And basically what you find there is what I
mentioned before is changes in people's attitudes about women okay, with
long-term exposure, that research, again, is new. And I should also
mention by the way, that yes, we anger subjects but if one takes a good
close look, by the way, also at that study in which he is talking about
or that particular chapter, at least with the aggressive material,
aggressive pornography, you don't have to anger subjects to get
increases in aggressive behavior against them. And particularly now with
our newer research, we have subjects again who are not only not angered,
they are void clinically of any hostile feelings whatsoever, yet you
find changes in their perceptions of violence, changes in their
perceptions of women as a function of one, yes, aggressive pornography,
two, R-rated sexually violent films, but also commercially released
standard X-rated films. Those again are not films which we have called
nonviolent erotica in this experimental research. And I think that that
point really has to be emphasized.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1}
[Right, there is another point made by Dr. Reiss, where he characterizes
the relationship between the films that you used in your study and films
that exist in the world. His phrasing on it is, "The new element that
Donnerstein adds concerning whether one type of pornography, i. e.,
violent pornography, would produce increases in sexually aggressive
behavior. The point that needs emphasis here at the outset is that this
is but one type of pornography and the majority of pornographic films
would not fit the label of violent pornography. " Could you discuss
that?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, okay. I assume he is going to
define violent as sexual assault or rape. Let's talk about that first.
In the more recent accounts you find probably on the covers of, there
has been some studies by some Harvard physicians of the adult bookstore
fare. And even without reading the material, or going into seeing what
is in the material, just from covers alone around 30 percent of the
material is graphically violent. Okay. Now of course we know that even
some of the---inside the covers, there is some violent material. For
instance, there is some recent research by Malamuth and Spinner, taking
the more popular types of magazines like]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}
[and]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4} [which on the cover obviously have
nothing to do with violence yet, they have found that over the last six,
seven years, there has been an increase in the amount of violent
depictions in those magazines, with]{.font4} [Penthouse,]{.font4} [I
think, accounting for about 15 percent of their pictorials, cartoons,
and so forth and so on, have violent overtones. So it's hard here to
deal with what is violent and what isn't. Also there is some recent
research by Jim Check, up in Ontario, showing that of the commercially
released, 25 percent of those which contain any sex scenes also contain
scenes of violence, explicit violence. Now, if we are talking about what
is 25-30 percent, that's a lot. That's commercially produced. In fact in
our own research \[when\] we go looking for X-rated films we find pretty
close, at least in the video cassette market, pretty close to 50 percent
contain some scenes of violence in them. Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [How did you select the X-rated films that
you used?]{.font4} [DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In our own
research?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In your own research.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They are selected because they are, one,
commercially available, very popular and have played in theaters, on
campus and so on and are the commercially released variety and are well
known, a lot of them as it turns out. The interesting thing about the
X-rated commercially released market is how the violence is displayed,
which I think is the most important thing. While maybe only 25 or 30
percent of them contain overt violence, I think we probably all find
that 90-95 percent of the time when a woman is sexually assaulted or
raped or aggressed against someway in these films, she is turned on and
shows pleasure, enjoyment and so on and so on. And of course, I doubt if
anyone would disagree in the academic community about what that does in
terms of people's aggressive behavior and attitudes and so forth and so
on because there is a little too much research on that. But I think when
one talks about 25 percent or 30 percent we are talking about explicit,
overt, physical violence. We are not talking about the types of material
which Zillmann used, which is the other 70 percent. Which is the general
commercial fare. Yes that might not lead directly, this other 70
percent, to immediate increases in aggressive behavior. But there's no
question now from the newer research coming out that long-term exposure
begins to change people s perception and attitudes about women and also
about rape. Now what that eventually spills over into is hard to tell as
you, I think, asked me before, can one predict aggressive behavior from
attitudes? Yes, one can. So I think one can make some general
speculation about what would be going on. Thirty percent is a lot, by
the way. Particularly when you don't know you are going to be confronted
with it. We, in our own research, have chosen films sometimes based upon
titles and descriptions hoping they wouldn't contain overt physical
aggression, okay, and lo and behold they do. So it's really hard to tell
what the true percentages are.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right. There is an additional comment that
bears on that in Mr. Reiss' letter. He says that one important question
is whether the males---here he refers to the males in the experiment in
which there was anger and then shocks were far more likely toward
women---"An important question is whether those males who administered
shocks to females in the experiment were thereby more likely to commit
rape, etc., etc. " He says that this is a very difficult question and
then says, "In addition, the possibility of that pornography reducing
aggression towards women is not even measured. For example, how many of
these men gained a sense of sexual relief from these films which reduced
their likelihood of aggressing against females. "]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [None. But there has been research on
that. I mean there is no research which demonstrates that the type of
typical fare reduces aggressive behavior. In fact what the research has
shown, okay, is that mildly erotic material, and that probably isn't the
adult bookstore material, okay, but mildly erotic material and sometimes
material which we create in the laboratory, does have a tendency to
reduce aggressive behavior, mainly because it isn't arousing, it doesn't
do anything. As soon as you move toward any material which becomes
arousing, and we're not talking about violent material by the way, we're
talking about sort of the standard fare, a film like "Debbie Does
Dallas" which we use in our own research, would be considered arousing,
okay. It increases aggressive behavior, if only because arousal
increases aggressive behavior and that has been known for twenty years
already. So to say that it reduces aggression, I'm not sure where that
data really is when you are talking about the standard fare of material
because the only way it could reduce aggression is to reduce arousal and
we know it doesn't do that. In fact we know it increases general
physiological arousal, it increases sexual arousal, so that there is no
way that that can basically happen. And I think that often gets into
\[a\] sort of a myth which also presents a lot of problems because I
think one could also argue that if you have someone who is predisposed
towards violence against women, a potential rapist, that if they view
women being raped and then masturbate to the material that it's going to
act as a safety valve. The problem is that what you are doing is
conditioning sexual release, or relief, which is a very positive thing
in men, to violence or to rape. One doesn't have to be a scientist to
understand what conditioning does. It only takes\' a few trials and then
you run into problems. I think I mentioned in the hearings some of the
more recent research by Neil Malamuth which is now out in a number of
book chapters which shows that you can get this conditioning very quick
to the point that now men, normal males, will become sexually aroused
just to scenes of women being raped because of this whole long-term
conditioning process. I think the whole idea of catharsis really has to
be put aside. It was a theoretical idea which was talked about years ago
and I think that if somebody is going to address the issue, let them
cite the data. It's not going to be there, by the way. What will be
there is that mild erotica, erotica okay, can go ahead in some cases
reduce aggressive behavior. That isn't standard fare, okay, that we're
talking about. I think that's important to point out here.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In the paragraph that follows that one and
maybe what Professor Reiss is considering possible data for the
catharsis hypothesis, although that may not be why he put there what he
says, is that, he is talking about his conception of the causal role of
pornography in our culture as the key question and then goes on to say
that as he reads the data on human sexuality, "The type of pornography
we have is a reflection of our basic society, not a cause of aggression
against women. " He then cites work by a Danish \[author\] Kuchinsky,
called "The Effect of Availability\... "]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yeah.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [From the]{.font4} [Journal of Social
Issues]{.font4} [1973 indicating no increases in sexual crimes and a
drop from 220 to 87 in the annual rate of child molestation. Could you
comment on that data?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah, well a couple of things, one it's a
correlation which means you cannot determine any causality at all, and
that's been known for a long time. Secondly, ---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Unlike your study?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yeah, you don't know what comes first
here the chicken or the egg compared to experimental research where
independent of subjects\' predispositions, we determine what they see.
So you see, you can talk about cause and effect. With correlational
studies you cannot, which Kuchinsky's work is. Secondly, which I think
is also important regarding this is, one, if you find a reduction in
child molestation which he does---I know Berl Kuchinsky well---is that
one, he talks about catharsis which of course becomes totally impossible
on the grounds that if there wouldn't be child pornography, you can't
get catharsis. So that's sort of an inconsistency right there. More
important, of course, a number of things. One, the data is correlational
and there are a number of people who have reanalyzed it and find
differences and I think the problem is criticisms of both sides, those
who find increases and those who find decreases. Secondly, it's unique
to Copenhagen. I mean here we have a society which has certain attitudes
about children which are a little different than ours. Secondly, we have
a culture which by the way is very anti-violence in the media period.
Okay. So to go ahead and generalize from what transpires in Copenhagen
to what might transpire in New York City or Madison or Minneapolis, is
impossible to do because for instance if I wanted to go ahead and look
at the correlations, I could take the city of Madison which I think
showed about a 40 percent increase this year in sexual assaults
okay---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Reported sexual assaults?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Reported sexual assaults, correct. I
would also know that there has been an increase, we have data on that,
in the amount of sexual violence in films. Now I could easily put
together correlations which show that as sexual violence in films has
gone up, Madison has shown an increase in reported instances of rape.
Well, that doesn't tell us anything at all. Again you don't know what is
coming first. I think that one can find any type of data one wants; that
doesn't mean that in Copenhagen there hasn't been a decrease, there may
well have been a decrease. But you don't know what it's due to and in
fact again if you look at the whole culture you would find that there is
a whole host of factors operating here which probably without any
changes in the legislation probably would have found exactly the same
thing. But you are never going to---the only way you can determine
causality, by the way, is through experimental research. Secondly, the
only way to determine what happens in our own culture with this type of
material is to do studies here. There have been some, some stuff by
Murray Strauss which is very recent by the way, I don't think that
Professor Reiss would be ]{.font4}[quite familiar with this, it has just
come out, that is also correlational which has just the opposite
effect.]{.sgc-4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What does that show?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, it basically shows that as the
readership of certain types of magazines which would be classified as
pornography goes up so does the incidence of rape and sexual assault.
Well that's just the opposite of Kuchinsky.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My feeling is though that it is all
correlational study and the problem is that you can't make any
definitive statements and I think we have to be fair to all the data. If
we want to cite the Copenhagen stuff, fine, but I think we are going to
have to look at the Strauss data. People like \[John\] Court, even
though there is criticisms of it, but people who have done correlations
in other countries really find the opposite effect. It's not really a
fair test and I think we can't---by the way, I don't think we can
constantly keep going back to 1973, 1972 data which is older than that,
by the way, to the Pornography Commission data which is talked about
here which is 1968, 1969.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So, you are saying that the 1973 issue of
the]{.font4} [Journal of Social Issues]{.font4} [is a republication of
the Pornography---\[Commission\]?]{.font4} [DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1}
[Oh, that is exactly what it is. Oh, yeah. And basically we just can't
keep bringing up data of 14, 15 years ago. Times have changed, the
materials have changed, the questions we ask are changed. As an example,
some of the classic data---and I don't disagree with it, I think that
one can still find it today---is that rapists or convicted sexual
assault individuals have less exposure to pornography and this was the
'68, '69 data by Goldstein and other people. That might be true. They
might have less exposure to what we normally would have called back in
the late sixties "pornography. " What we know, however, is that they
have less exposure mainly because they are often not aroused by that
material. What a pedophile or child molester is aroused by is kiddie
porn. How much kiddie porn was around in the late sixties? That's what
they would search out. What a rapist is turned on to, we learn now from
the research of Abel and Malamuth, is that they are turned on to
violence against women. How much violent material was there in the late
sixties? They are not searching out normal fare, because normal fare is
not a sexual turn-on to them. Today, however, you find particularly with
very violent rapists, and here I'm talking about those who maybe commit
murder, ]{.font4}[mutilation, something of that nature, there is a lot
of anecdotal data now that those individuals had in their possession
materials depicting very similar types of crimes. Okay. That type of
material was fairly underground in the sixties. And basically we were
also asking in the sixties the question that rape would be strictly a
crime of sexual motivation only. Okay, that if somebody views
pornography they become sexually aroused that pushes them out to commit
a rape. So since rapists don't expose themselves to sexually explicit
material consequently there can be no relationship. Well, first of all
that is contradictory, number one, with more recent data. Secondly, it
goes through the issue through the back door and, more important, given
all the new research it strongly suggests that they seek out different
types of material.]{.sgc-4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thus, the issue is not so much how much
pornography people who become sexual offenders were exposed to, as what
kind of pornography they were exposed to?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What kind, yes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And was available?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And was available at that time. And
secondly, if you take a good close look, not at the final Commission
report, but the actual data, okay, you find a substantial minority
indicate that the material did have an effect, about 40 percent.
Now---]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [A minority of 40 percent?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [A minority of 40 percent. But, you see,
it's very easy to say the majority do not. So I think one must take a
very, very close look at the data but also realize that you can't talk
about the material and studies done in the late sixties. I think, a lot
of people would argue that some of the slides and even some of the films
shown really aren't that representative of what's out there today and
they definitely aren't representative of what's out there today. They
definitely aren't representative, by the way, \[of material\] which has
violent overtones. The Commission made it their policy to stay away from
violent material except in one article by Percy Tannenbaum which did use
violent material and did find, by the way, an increase in aggressive
behavior. But since that type of material was nonexistent, no mention
was made and no real data was collected from rapists about particular
types of materials they were dealing with, I think that you would even
find people like Goldstein and others, who are now aware of the newer
data, who wouldn't agree with some of the statements and research years
ago. In fact, even Kuchinsky argues that, for crying out loud, you have
the most violent material in the states I've ever seen. Okay? That
you're dealing with totally different types of things here in totally
different cultures.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He says that the material in the United
States is more violent than that in Denmark?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, yes. And that---you know, he himself
would admit you can't make comparisons between Copenhagen and anyplace
else. Copenhagen \[is\] Copenhagen just like Minneapolis is
Minneapolis.]{.font4} [MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right. I think that
you've touched oh most of the research that was also referred to in the
article in the]{.font4} [Tribune]{.font4} [about---I mean, it quotes Mr.
Goldstein from 1973, it quotes Mr. Kuchinsky from 1973---]{.font4}
[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah, in fact, I'm glad---somebody did by
the way, I do have a copy of that. And in fact Mr. Newlen actually, I
had spoken to him---he tried to get ahold of me when I was on vacation.
I got back to work a little too late. And he had mentioned that he did
put it in the Saturday day paper of the]{.font4} [Minneapolis
Star]{.font4}[. So I did get a copy of the article.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is there anything else, then, from that
article that you would like to respond to?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think that it's sort of the traditional
type of thing. One, again, I don't think you can keep bringing up
1973]{.font4} [Journal of Social Issues]{.font4} [out of the old
Pornography Commission data. Number two, of course when you speak to sex
therapists or people in human sexuality, it's very interesting, they all
say, there is some problems with the violent material. I mean, there is
really agreement there. But the types of material that they deal with in
sex education courses or in materials which they cite as having a
therapeutic effect, is not the material which is the standard fare of
adult bookstores. It's like it's the material we use in some of our
earlier research. There are companies which make films specifically for
sex education. Okay? For the most part, you aren't going to find these
gross power differentials, submissive, degradation occurring. I don't
think any sex therapist would go ahead and try to instill that. I mean,
I might be wrong, but I don't think that might be the case. I think the
material is quite different.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So what you are saying is that the material
that they are using when they say "erotica" or "nonviolent erotica" is
not what you're studying when you study what you call
pornography?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, no, no, not at all. It's totally
different. In one sense, I think in any academic discipline there is a
long time between the time certain articles get out---in one discipline,
my own field of psychology, till it gradually gets filtered down into
the sociological community, the human sexuality community, the legal
community. Unfortunately, there are years and years before a lot of
these definitions are really cleared up. And I think basically there is
some misunderstanding of what we and other researchers have meant by our
material. We are not saying at all that something that a sex therapist
or human sexuality class at maybe the University of Minnesota might
show, has an effect. It might be very therapeutic, but those are
different types of materials made specifically for that purpose, just
like we made it for ours. That is not what you are going to go to and
randomly find in your local adult bookstore.]{.font4}
[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I would like to do now is ask you a
couple of questions about the definition in the ordinance itself in
relation to the research that you've been talking about, and the
definitions that you've been talking about.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Do you have a copy of it there?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, on page 3 the definition of
pornography section (gg) subsection (1) it says, "Pornography is the
sexually explicit subordination of women. " It goes on to say other
things, but I'd just like to ask you about that part, "sexually explicit
subordination of women" and how that phrase fits with the lines that you
have drawn and the definitions that you have made in your
research?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah. I think it is the subordination,
degradation, dehumanizing of women, the unequal power relationship which
is the issue. Okay. Sexual explicitness, no.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [But all your research is about sexually
explicit---\[materials\]]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All our research is about sexually
explicitness, yes, yes exactly.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So that when this says "sexually explicit
subordination of women, " is it fair to say that the combination of the
violence that you study in some of the materials with the coercion and
force and degradation that you study in other materials are the kinds of
things that could also be encompassed by the term, "sexually explicit
subordination of women"?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, yes, oh, yes. Sexually explicit
erotica does not include subordination of women, okay? So when I talk
about non-violent erotica in our research we do not mean material, okay,
which in any way objectifies, degrades, subordinates women. In fact, our
material was put together with the help of our rape crisis center,
women's support center and so on. Primarily by women who had their
definition of what should be purely erotic and recreated \[in\] the
film. Again, that has to be strongly emphasized. Just like, by the way
in a sort of aside, when we had to do research on negative reactions of
women to being raped in films, we had to create that film, too, because
we couldn't find a standard ten-minute loop film in an adult bookstore
which didn't show\* a woman being sexually attacked or assaulted without
her being turned on. Okay? That's a common type of scenario. So a lot of
the stuff we created is artificial in nature.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right, right. But you do include something
other than violence in your definition of pornography. That is, to say,
what you study when you say nonviolent erotica, that not only excludes
any form of subordination but if there is the presence of anything like
force or coercion or dehumanization then it's gone.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It's gone, yeah, yeah. Now that would not
be the case of the new research we're doing with what we call X-rated
material, okay? That is material as it is and some of that material is
going to contain without question mild forms of violence. What we try to
take out is explicit graphic violence.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Then you leave in forms of force,
coercion---]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah. In fact, I mean, the notion "no,
no, no, no---now yes, " okay, is the common theme and that is of course
the way the films just are. That we mean non-violent in this newer
research meaning somebody's not attacked or cut with a knife.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Now I'd like you to look at the one
through nine characteristics there that are additional characteristics
that have to be present before something is pornography. Could you just
read through those in order and say what you know about the current
research on each of those descriptions?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Women are presented dehumanized as
sexual objects, things or commodities. Of course, the new research by
Dolf Zill-mann shows that long term exposure to exactly that type of
material (he would use the word "trivialize"---but it's really the same
thing here) leads to \[an\] increase in callous attitudes, a reduction
in sensitivity to rape. Our own new research shows exactly the same
thing, okay? The thing is it's a little longer for the effects to
occur.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And your studies are the first long term
studies of that material?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yeah, truly long term. The Commission did
long term studies, by the way, but all they did was to look at sexual
arousal, and interest in sex and what Zillmann argues is yes, people do
become habituated. They become less sexually aroused. But what's
happening is at the same time they are becoming desensitized to women in
general and we do the same thing in our own research. Yes, people are
less bothered about it but that doesn't mean there aren't changes which
are now occurring in their own attitudes and that's the thing that the
Commission, by the way, just didn't ask. Mainly because it just wasn't
theoretically an issue at that point, where it is today.]{.font4}

[Two, women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy pain and
humiliation. Well, as I mentioned, a lot of the research that we've done
and Malamuth does deals with sexually violent material in which the
common scenario is that women get turned on to aggression and that it's
a sexual thing for women and that tends to not only reinforce attitudes
in males who have those attitudes to begin with, but tends to change
subjects who might be a little ambiguous about these issues and
increases their willingness to say they would commit rape. It increases
their acceptance of myths about rape and acceptance of interpersonal
violence. There is just tons of research on that.]{.font4}

[Number three, women are presented as sexual objects who experience
sexual pleasure in being raped. That is the common aggressive
pornography. Okay? In fact, if one takes a look at, of course, any S/M
magazine, that is the scenario and just about all the films---well, 95
percent of the films we use---that also occurs. That rape, sexual
violence, is a turn-on.]{.font4}

[Women are presented as sexual objects tied up, or cut up, or mutilated,
or bruised---again, yes. That type of material---and I think it's
interesting to say, that even if you present material that is graphic,
in which the victim doesn't get turned on but let's say is mutilated,
raped and experiences a great deal of pain---again, the research by
Malamuth shows that there are about 25 percent or 30 percent of the
"normal" male population who gets turned on off of that material. Okay?
Now the vast majority get turned on to the material in which the woman
shows a positive reaction. But even if you take that out and show some
of the most graphic forms of violence like in the research we are doing
now, by the way, that is a turn-on to a strong minority and I think
there is no question about that and also, by the way, a turn-on to known
convicted rapists.]{.font4}

[Women are presented in postures of sexual submission. Again, that is
sort of the trivialization and women strictly as objects and the newer
research shows that that has an effect with long term exposure on
attitudes.]{.font4}

[Women's body parts including but not limited to vaginas, breasts and
buttocks are exhibited such that women are reduced exactly to those
parts. In fact, in the X-rated material, part of our de-briefing to
re-sensitize subjects to the issue of women and try to eliminate some of
the stereotypes and their changes in the perception of rape, is to go
back and say what these films have done is literally treated women as
parts rather than as a whole person. In fact, we make it very specific
that one of the reasons these X-rated non-violent films, okay, are
affecting them is because women are seen strictly as sexual objects and
long term exposure to that trivializes women, makes them seem
promiscuous, always asking for it, consequently when they now serve as
jurors in rape trials they get the usual "oh, she was there for a
particular reason, she was really asking for it. " And that leads to a
less sensitive attitude about rape and about women.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is that also true, typically, for the
materials that persistently show women in postures of sexual
submission?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, yeah, yeah. It's just basically
treating women as strictly objects period. Subordinate, submissive to
men, being there really to do one thing and that is to serve men's
sexual need. That is not, again, what we have defined as erotica in our
research, okay. There is an equal relationship going on in our
particular view.]{.font4}

[Women are presented as whores by nature. Well, basically if you look at
the new Zillmann research and read some of the items from the Sex
Callousness Scale not only---it's hard to tell whether the material
depicts that as much as that is the perception subjects get from it. In
fact, the Sex Callousness Scale is about as blatant as one can get, I
think. And you find with normal fare, nonviolent material, you get
it.]{.font4}

[Women are presented as being penetrated by objects or animals---yes.
Particularly in the violent material. Zillmann also argues in a]{.font4}
[Journal of Communication]{.font4} [article and in one of his new books,
is that what happens is that after people become desensitized to normal
fare, they now began to search out what he calls more bizarre
material---could be aggressive, could be bestiality which they now
become sexually aroused to. So they are now becoming aroused and turned
on to women having]{.font4}

[intercourse with animals or women being hung up, raped, etc. because
the other material was no longer, by the way, creating any effect. In
fact, material such as bestiality did lead to increases in aggressive
behavior, by the way. Because it was so arousing, in that
research.]{.font4}

[Women are presented in scenarios of degradation, injury, abasement,
torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, etc. ---yes. To
me, that's basically the standard aggressive pornography fare and again
in the vast majority of that material, women get turned on by all of
this and that affects most of the subjects in the research which we have
looked at, and other people. But even if they don't get turned on you
find a good strong percentage of subjects who are already pre-hostile
who get turned on to that. So it's really very much of a Catch-22 in a
lot of that. In that sense, I think, with all of these there is now
research on the effects. And basically, I think one of the problems is,
that the type of material we've talked about again, and we've been going
through this for the last hour on sexually explicit non-violent erotica,
is not one of these.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Could you also talk a little bit, briefly,
about the kinds of materials that have been used by the researchers, in
that the statute talks about pictures, it talks about the written word,
and so on? Could you just characterize the type of materials that people
use, as to the validity of this definition and its effects?]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think the interesting thing about the
research is that a lot of people are doing it quite independently of
each other, not knowing what other people were doing. Some people were
using audio tapes, some were using written passages, some were using
just slides, some were using films---everybody was finding the same
thing. It tended to make little or no difference what essentially was
the modality which was being used here. And that was interesting because
it did add a lot of external validity to the research. It suggested that
it is not specific to a ten-minute film clip. In fact, most of Neil
Malamuth's research which I addressed at the hearing dealt with either
audio tapes or written passages which subjects read. The research by the
way of Gene Abel which I addressed, with rapists, are written passages.
Taken from novels, magazines, etc., etc. It makes really literally no
difference. I think one can get into a little nit-picking about whether
one's going to be more arousing than the other, but in the long run
there seems to be no difference that anybody has found between it---nor
should there be. People can fill in the gaps.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay. Those are all the questions that I
have. What I would like to do is call you back and work out the physical
arrangements here.]{.font4}

[DONNERSTEIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Okay, will do. Bye-bye.]{.font4}

[]{#indianAppen2.xhtml#bookmark2}[Appendix B: Brief]{.font4 .sgc-1}
[Amicus Curiae]{.font4 .sgc-1} [of Andrea Dworkin, American Booksellers
v. Hudnut, Indianapolis, Indiana (Excerpt)]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[ARGUMENT]{.font4}

[I.  Pornography Is a Central Element in the Oppression of
Women]{.font4}

[Judge Barker says that pornography as defined in the Ordinance is
constitutionally protected speech. ^1^ This means that the abuse of
women in pornography, the trafficking in women that constitutes the bulk
of pornography, the coercion of women required to make pornography, the
abuses of women inevitably resulting from pornography, and the
inequality created by pornography all have constitutional protection.
Women cannot function as citizens in this world of social and sexual
predation.]{.font4}

[[1. See American Booksellers Assoc'n v. Hudnut, 598 F. Supp. 1316 (D.
Ind. 1984) (Barker, J.) for the district court opinion being discussed
here.]{.sgc-8}\
]{.font4}

[The Ordinance characterizes pornography as "a discriminatory practice
based on sex. " Speech and action are meshed in this discrimination,
which is a system of sexual exploitation constructed on sex-based
powerlessness and which generates sex-based abuse. The presence of
speech cannot be used to immunize discrimination and sexual abuse from
legal remedy.]{.font4}

[When pornography is photographic, it is indisputably action. It gets
perceived as speech because the woman in the photograph is effectively
rendered an object or commodity by the pornography; the perception of
the photograph as speech in itself denies the human status of the woman
in it. The so-called speech belongs to whomever took or sold the
photograph---the pornographer---not to the woman used in it, to whom
things were done as if she were an object or commodity, and who indeed
continues to be sold as an object or commodity. The woman is excluded
from recognizably human dialogue by the uses to which she is put. The
courts reify this injustice when they take the photograph to be real
speech and do not recognize the woman in it as a real person who, by
virtue of being human, is necessarily being used in ways antagonistic to
full human status. The court accepts the pornographers' misogyny as its
own if it holds that the pornographers' exploitation of a woman's body
is an appropriate use of her: that what she is entitled to as a human
being is properly expressed in these uses to which she is put.]{.font4}

[The actions immortalized in pornography are not ideas, thoughts, or
fantasies. The vocabulary of "sexual fantasy, " often applied to
pornography as a genre, is in fact the language of prostitution, where
the act that the man wants done and pays to get done is consistently
referred to as his "fantasy, " as if it never happens in the real world.
He goes to a prostitute and pays her money so that she will do what he
tells her to do, and it is this]{.font4} [act]{.font4 .sgc-7} [that is
called "fantasy. "]{.font4}

[Similarly, in pornography,]{.font4} [acts]{.font4 .sgc-7} [done to or
by women are called "speech, " even though the woman is doing an act
dictated by what is required to sexually gratify men. Her body is a
commodity in itself. Her body is also the literal language of the
so-called publisher, who in reality is a pimp trafficking in women.
Because the pimp introduces a camera into the trafficking, his whole
process of exploiting the woman's body is protected as "speech.
"]{.font4}

[The First Amendment predated the invention of the camera. The founding
fathers could never have considered that there might be physical rights
of people trampled on by rights of speech: that in protecting a
photograph, for instance, one might be protecting an actual act of
torture. In pornography, photographs are made with real women. These
photographs are then used on real women, to get them to do the acts the
real women in the photographs are doing.]{.font4}

[The hostility and discrimination produced by written pornography is
just as real. In written pornography, the vocabularies of sex and
violence are inextricably combined, so that erection and orgasm are
produced as pleasurable responses to sexual abuse. This behaviorally
conditions men to sex as dominance over and violence against women. The
nature of written pornography is definable and distinct enough from all
other written material that it can be isolated as well as recognized.
Sexually explicit and abusive male dominance, conveyed in repeated acts
of rape, torture, and humiliation, is the entire substance of written
pornography.]{.font4} [See]{.font4} [Smith, "The Social Content of
Pornography, " 26 J.]{.font4} [Communication]{.font4} [16 (1976). It is
impossible, however, to separate the effects of written pornography from
the effects of photographic pornography.]{.font4}

[Obscenity law recognizes the incredible physical impact of this kind of
sexually explicit material, written and photographic, on men---an impact
so different from the impact of any known form of "speech" that the
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that obscenity is not speech, even
though it is words and pictures.]{.font4} [See, e. g., Roth v. United
States,]{.font4} [354 U. S. 476, 485 (1957). ^2\[2\] ^The standard of
"prurient interest" suggests the kind of line that the court wants to
draw between "speech" and "not speech" even with regard to words and
pictures. "Prurient" means "itch" or "itching"; it is derived from the
Sanscrit "he burns. " If he itches, let alone burns, the power and
urgency of his response is not socially innocuous. Pornography creates
the physiologically real conviction in men that women want abuse; that
women are whores by nature; that women want to be raped and humiliated;
that women get sexual pleasure from pain; even that women get sexual
pleasure from being maimed or killed.]{.font4} [See]{.font4}
[Minneapolis City Council, Public Hearings on Ordinance to Add
Pornography as Discrimination Against Women (hereinafter, "Minneapolis
Hearings"), Sess. Ill (Dec. 13, 1983), 5]{.font4} [p. m.]{.font3}
[session at 34 (testimony of Barbara Chester); Malamuth and Check,
"Penile Tumescence and Perceptual Responses to Rape as a Function of
Victims' Perceived Reactions, " 10]{.font4} [J. Applied Social
Psych.]{.font4} [528 (1980). Obscenity law is premised on the
inevitability of male sexual response to sexually explicit verbal and
visual stimuli; it occurs in a world of concrete male dominance,
obscenity law itself originating in a context of legalized male
ownership of women.]{.font4}

[Judicial decisions reflect and perpetuate the focus on male response,
by wholly ignoring women, both in and outside the pornography. The
statutory definition of pornography in the Ordinance articulates for the
first time in the law how pornography both uses and impacts on women in
particular, which is what distinguishes it as a uniquely destructive
phenomenon. Pornography is appropriately recognized as an energetic
agent of male domination over women. Pornography creates a devastating
relationship between the status of some women, who are particularly
powerless and vulnerable to abuse, and the status of all women. The
vicious exploitation through sex of some women in pornography as
entertainment establishes a sexual imperative in which forcing sex on
any woman ]{.font4}[is justified. The had treatment of some women in
pornography justifies the second-class status of all women in society,
because the bad treatment is presented as an appropriate response to the
human worthlessness of women as such. Only]{.font4} [some]{.font4}
[Christians had to be slaughtered as public entertainment in Roman
circuses for all Christians and all Romans to understand who could be
hurt, harassed, and persecuted with]{.font4} [de facto]{.font4}
[impunity.]{.font4}

[[2.  \[2.\] Obscenity laws and standards themselves are based on values
of male domination and sexual inequality. Obscenity laws are
woman-hating, incorporating antiwoman strains in early Judeo-Christian
theology that hold women to be carnal, provocative, evil, dirty, sinful,
and lewd. The prohibitions on nudity implicitly assume that a woman's
body unclothed is a sexual provocation, and that sexual expressiveness
by a woman is necessarily lewd and lascivious.]{.sgc-8}\
]{.font4}

[Pornographers draw on and benefit from particularly cruel aspects of
women's vulnerability. Incest and child sexual abuse produce between
two-thirds and three-quarters of the women who get exploited in
pornography.]{.font4} [See]{.font4} [James and Meyerding, "Early Sexual
Experiences and Prostitution, " 134]{.font4} [Am. J. Psychiatry]{.font4}
[1381 (1977); Silbert and Pines, "Pornography and Sexual Abuse of Women,
" 10]{.font4} [Sex Roles]{.font4} [857 (1984); Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, Subcommittee on Juvenile Justice, "A Hearing to Consider the
Effects of Pornography on Children and Women" (Aug. 8, 1984) (Testimony
of Katherine Brady). The ownership of a girl by her father or other
adult male, including sexual ownership of her, is deeply implicated in
the continuing vulnerability of adult women to the sexual abuse of
pornography. It is not possible to draw a firm line between the uses of
children in pornography, recognized in]{.font4} [New York v.
Ferber]{.font4}[; 458 U. S. 747 (1982), and the uses of women in
pornography, since so many of the women are habituated to sexual abuse,
even first used in pornography, as children. The court must not accept
the pornographers' propaganda, which insists that these women have made
a career choice as free and equal adults for pornographic exploitation.
The ownership of women and children by adult men is historically linked
(for example, in the power of the Roman]{.font4}
[paterfamilias]{.font4}[); and it is empirically and sociologically
linked in the abuse of women and children in pornography.]{.font4}

This is surely the nadir of social worthlessness.]{.font4}

[II.  Pornographers' Rights of Expression are Outweighed by Women's
Rights to Equality]{.font4}

[*A.*  *The Expression of Ideas Through Injurious Acts Is Not
Constitutionally Protected*]{.font4}

[It is wrong to say, as Judge Barker did, that pornography as defined in
the Ordinance expresses ideas and is therefore protected speech, unless
one is prepared to say that murder or rape or torture with an ideology
behind it also expresses ideas and might well be protected on that
account. Most acts express ideas. Most systems of exploitation or
inequality express ideas. Segregation expressed an idea more eloquently
than any book about the inferiority of black people ever did. Yet the
Supreme Court overturned segregation---after protecting it for a very
long time--- because the Court finally grasped its harm to people. The
difference between the Court's view in]{.font4} [Plessy v.
Ferguson,]{.font4} [163 U. S. 537, 551 (1896), that segregation harmed
blacks "solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction
upon it, " and its view in]{.font4} [Brown v. Bd. of Education of
Topeka,]{.font4} [347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954) that segregation "generates
a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may
affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone, " is
dramatic and instructive. The fact that the idea that segregation
expressed would suffer because the idea required the practice for much
of its persuasive power did not afford segregation constitutional
protection: attempts to invoke First Amendment justifications have been
thoroughly repudiated.]{.font4} [See, e. g., Norwood v.
Harrison,]{.font4} [413 U. S. 455 (1973), where the attempt was made to
invoke rights of association and free exercise of
religion; ]{.font4}[Bob Jones University v. United States,]{.font4} [-U.
S. -, 103 S. Ct. 2017 ]{.font4}[(1983) (upholding state prohibition on
sex discrimination in public accommodations]{.sgc-4}[ against freedom of
association challenge);]{.font4} [Hishon v. King & Spalding]{.font4}[,
-U. S. ------, 104 S. Ct. 2229 (1984) (upholding application of Title
VII against freedom of association challenge).]{.font4}

[3.  \[3.\] Ted Bundy described a hypothetical killer like himself in
this way: "Then he got sucked into the more sinister doctrines that are
implicit in pornography---the use, the abuse, the possession of women as
objects. " Michaud and Aynesworth, supra, at 105.]{.font4 .sgc-8}

[An effort to claim that segregation was protected as first amendment
"speech" because it has a point of view and an ideology would be a
transparent use of the First Amendment to shield a practice of
inequality; and such a claim for pornography is similarly transparent.
Exploitation cannot be protected because it expresses the idea that the
people being exploited are inferior or worthless as human beings or
deserve to be exploited. All exploitation fundamentally expresses
precisely that idea.]{.font4}

[B.  The Sexual Exploitation of Women Perpetuated by Pornography Negates
Women\'s Rights to Equality]{.font4 .sgc-7}

[In her decision, Judge Barker says that "\[a\]dult women generally have
the capacity to protect themselves from participating in and being
personally victimized by pornography. " Slip op. at 38. The fault, she
suggests, is with the individual who is hurt, and no legal remedy is
justified. Adult men generally have the capacity to protect themselves
from being murdered; yet murderers are not excused because they only
succeed in murdering men who are dumb enough, weak enough, or
provocative enough to get killed. Indeed, no one ever thinks of male
victims of violence in those terms at all. Yet that valuation of women
hurt by pornography is implicit in Judge Barker's misogynistic
logic.]{.font4}

[It is not true that women can protect ourselves from being victimized
by pornography. Pornography's effect on our civil status---the way it
creates attitudes and behaviors of discrimination against us---is beyond
personal remedy. Pornography's role in generating sexual abuse is beyond
our capacities as individuals to stop or moderate, especially with no
legal recourse against its production, sale, exhibition, or
distribution. Sexual abuse is endemic in this country. One-fifth to
one-third of all women have an unwanted sexual encounter with an adult
male as children; one woman in a hundred has had a sexual experience as
a child with her father or step-father; it is estimated that 16, 000 new
cases of father-daughter incest are initiated each year.]{.font4}
[See]{.font4} [J. Herman,]{.font4} [Father-Daughter Incest]{.font4}
[12-14 (1982). Studies and police and hospital records in different
localities suggest that battery occurs in one-third to one-half of all
marriages.]{.font4} [See]{.font4} [R. Langley and R. Levy,]{.font4}
[Wife Beating]{.font4} [4-11 (1977); D. Russell,]{.font4} [Rape in
Marriage]{.font4} [98-100 (1982). A documented forcible rape occurs
every seven minutes; and rape remains one of the most underreported
violent crimes.]{.font4} [See]{.font4} [Federal Bureau of
Investigation,]{.font4} [Uniform Crime Reports for the United
States]{.font4} [at 5, 14 (1983). Studies continue to be done in all
areas of sexual abuse, including sexual harassment, marital rape, and
prostitution; and the figures showing frequency of abuse increase as the
descriptions of violence become more precise and the political efforts
of feminists provide a context in which to comprehend the
abuse.]{.font4}

[The place of pornography in actually producing the scenarios and
behaviors that constitute that mass of sexual abuse is increasingly
documented, especially by victims. Coercion of women into pornography is
expanding as the market for live women expands, especially in video
pornography. Women in homes do not have the real social and economic
power to keep men from using pornography on them or making them
participate in it. There has been an increased use of cameras in actual
rapes, with the subsequent appearance of the photographs on the
commercial pornography market. Pornography itself is also being used as
a form of sexual assault: the public violation of a woman---photographs
made against her will or by fraud or without her knowledge, then
published as public rape. Her forced exposure, like rape, is an act of
hostility and humiliation. With the normalization of pornography, women
who have pictures of themselves used against them as sexual abuse have
no social or legal credibility to assert that rights of privacy were
violated, because they appear indistinguishable from other women in
similar photographs whose active compliance is presumed.]{.font4}

[The statutory definition of pornography in the Ordinance, far from
being "vague, " delineates the structure of actual, concrete material
produced and sold as pornography by the \$8-billion-a-year pornography
industry.]{.font4} [See U. S. News and World Report,]{.font4} [June 4,
1984, at 84-85. No adult bookstore has any problem knowing what to
stock. No consumer has any problem knowing what to buy. No pornography
theatre has any trouble knowing what to show. The so-called books are
produced by formula, and they do not vary ever in their nature, content,
or impact. They cannot be confused with the language of any writer I
have ever read, including Jean Genet and Jerzy Kosinski, who are
particularly graphic about rape and hate women. It may be difficult to
believe that the definition is accurate and clear, because it may be
difficult to believe that we are actually living in a country where the
material described in the statutory definition is being produced,
especially with live people. Nevertheless, we do. Or perhaps one effect
of using \$8 billion of pornography a\* year is that the basic premise
of this law appears bizarre by contrast with the pornography: that women
are human beings with rights of equality; and that being hurt by
pornography violates those rights.]{.font4}

[C.  ]{.font4 .sgc-7}[The Elimination of Sex Discrimination Is a
Compelling State Interest that Is Furthered by the Ordinance]{.font4
.sgc-7}

[Sex discrimination keeps more than half the population from being able
to enjoy the full benefits of free speech, because they are too poor to
buy speech, too silenced through sexual abuse to articulate in a
credible way their own experiences, too despised because of their sex to
be able to achieve the public significance required to exercise speech
in a technologically advanced society. The First Amendment protects
speech already articulated and published from state interference. It
does nothing to empower those who have been systematically
excluded---especially on the bases of sex and race---from pragmatic
access to the means of speech.]{.font4}

[The First Amendment is nearly as old as this country. The eradication
of sex discrimination is new as a compelling state interest, perhaps
causing Judge Barker to underestimate its importance.]{.font4} [Compare,
e. g., Goe-saert v. Cleary,]{.font4} [335 U. S. 464 (1948) (upholding
legal restrictions on women's occupational choices)]{.font4} [with
Roberts v. United States Jaycees,  \--U]{.font4}[. S.\--, 104 \[S. Ct.
\] 3244 (1984) (upholding application of
state ]{.sgc-4}[antidiscrimination law to business and civic group).
Without vigorous action \[on\] behalf of equality, women will never be
able to exercise the speech that the First Amendment would then
protect.]{.sgc-4}

[State governments were not held to the proscriptions on government in
the First Amendment until the Supreme Court held that the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated first amendment
standards.]{.font4} [See, e. g., Fiske v. Kansas,]{.font4} [274 U. S.
380 (1927). Nevertheless, the simple reality is that the First Amendment
and its values of free speech existed in harmony with both legal slavery
and legal segregation. No effective legal challenge to those systems of
racial subordination was mounted under the rubric of freedom of
expression, even though in both systems reading and writing were at
issue. In slavery, laws prohibited teaching slaves to read or
write.]{.font4} [See]{.font4} [K. Stampp,]{.font4} [The Peculiar
Institution]{.font4} [208 (1956). In segregation, separate-but-equal
education assured that blacks remained widely illiterate; then literacy
tests were used to screen voters, so that blacks could not qualify to
vote.]{.font4} [See Oregon v. Mitchell,]{.font4} [400 U. S. 112, 132-33
(1970) (Black, J. );]{.font4} [Gaston County v. United States,]{.font4}
[395 U. S. 285 (1969).]{.font4} [Cf. Griggs v. Duke Power
Company,]{.font4} [401 U. S. 424, 430 (1971) (inferior segregated
education hurts blacks where employer uses non-job-related educational
criteria for employment decisions). Rights of speech, association, and
religion (being kept out of certain churches, for instance, by state
law), were simply denied blacks. The Civil War Amendments are an
institutional acknowledgment that powerlessness is not cured simply by
"more speech"; first amendment values alone could not fulfill
constitutional ambitions for dignity and equity that reside in
principles of justice not abrogated even by sadistic political
institutions like slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment, however,
purposefully used the word "male" in its guarantee of voting rights, U.
S. Const, amend. XIV, §2, to rule out any possible application of
equality rights to women's social and political condition. The right to
vote, won in 1920, gave women the most mundane recognition of civil
existence as citizens. U. S. Const., amend. XIX. The equality principles
underlying the Fourteenth Amendment were even then not applied to women
until 1971.]{.font4} [Reed v. Reed,]{.font4} [404 U. S. 71
(1971).]{.font4}

[The absolute, fixed, towering importance of the First Amendment and the
absolute, fixed insignificance of sex discrimination and of equality
interests in Judge Barker's decision is a direct consequence of how late
women came into this legal system as real citizens. Equality must be the
legal priority for any group excluded from constitutional protections
for so long and stigmatized as inferior. Yet the historical
worthlessness of women---which is why our interests are not as old as
this country---undermines any claim we make to having rights that must
be taken as fundamental: equality for women is seen as trivial, faddish.
The First Amendment, by contrast, is fundamental---a behemoth
characterized by longevity, constancy, and familiarity. Because women
have been silenced, and because women have been second-class, our
equality claims are seen as intrinsically inferior. The opposite should
be the case. Those whom the law has helped to keep out by enforcing
conditions of inferiority, servitude, and debasement should, by virtue
of that involuntary but intensely destructive exclusion, have the
court's full attention when asserting any equality claim.]{.font4}

[This must certainly be true when speech rights are asserted in behalf
of pornographers, since the speech of the pornographers is exercised
largely through sexual abuse and is intricately interwoven with physical
assault and injury. The First Amendment here is clearly being used to
shield those who are not only powerful but also cruel and cynical. The
victims, targeted on the basis of sex, must ask for relief from
systematic sexual predation through a recognition of equality rights,
because only equality stands up against the injury of longstanding
exclusion from constitutional protections. Judge Barker holds that only
expression matters, even when the expression is trafficking in women;
equality does not matter, and the systematic harms of inequality and
abuse suffered by women on a massive scale do not matter. This view of
the First Amendment relies on historical inequities to establish modern
constitutional priorities.]{.font4}

[The courts must, instead, give real weight to equality interests,
because of their historical exclusion from the original Bill of Rights.
The deformities of the social system caused by that exclusion destroy
justice, which requires symmetry, equity, and balance. By refusing to
give equality values any weight when in conflict with free speech
values, Judge Barker allows speech to function as if it were a military
arsenal: hoarded by men for over two centuries, it is now used to
bludgeon women, who have been without it and have none in reserve; we do
not even have slingshots against Goliath. If equality interests can
never matter against first amendment challenges, then speech becomes a
weapon used by the haves against the have-nots; and the First Amendment,
not balanced against equality rights of the have-nots, becomes an
intolerable instrument of dispossession, not a safeguard of human
liberty. The real exclusion of women from public discourse has allowed
men to accumulate speech as a resource of power; and with that power,
men have articulated values and furthered practices that have continued
to debase women and to justify that debasement. The First Amendment,
then, in reality, operates to the extreme detriment of those who do not
have the power of socially and politically real speech. In this case,
Judge Barker is saying that real people being tortured are properly not
persons with rights of equality that are being violated; but, because a
picture has been taken, are the abstract speech of those who exploit
them. She is saying that the victim in the photograph is properly
silent, even if gagged; that the victim's historical exclusion from
speech need not, cannot, and should not be changed by vigorous
legislative and judicial commitments to equality. She is saying that the
woman's body is properly seen as the man's speech; and, in this corrupt
logic, that the picture that in fact documents the abuse of a human
being is to be dignified as an idea that warrants legal protection.
Equality is indeed meaningless in this arrangement of power; and speech
is a nightmare with a victim whose humanity is degraded by both the
pornographers and the court.]{.font4}

[D.  ]{.font4 .sgc-7}[The Pornographers Degrade the First
Amendment]{.font4 .sgc-7}

[The pornographers also degrade the First Amendment by using it as a
shield to protect sexual abuse and sexual trafficking. If the court
allows these parasites an impenetrable shield of absolute protection
because they use pictures and words as part of the sexual abuse they
perpetrate and promote, there is really no end to the possible
manipulations of the First Amendment to protect like forms of
exploitation. All any exploiter has to do is to interject speech into
any practice of exploitation, however malignant, and hide the whole
practice behind the First Amendment. By isolating the speech elements in
other practices of discrimination and asserting their absolute
protection, the discrimination could be made to disappear. Consider, for
example, a common situation in sexual harassment in employment, where a
"speech" element---a sexual proposition from a supervisor---is part of a
chain of events leading to an adverse employment consequence.]{.font4}
[See, e. g., Tomkins v. Public Serv. Elec. & Gas Co.,]{.font4} [568 F.
2d 1044, 1045 (3d Cir. 1977), in which a conversation over lunch was a
crucial component of the Title VII violation. No court has held that the
mere presence of words in the process of discrimination turns the
discrimination into protected activity. The speech is part of the
discrimination. The Constitution places no value on
discrimination.]{.font4} [See ]{.font4}[Norwood v. Harrison,]{.font4}
[413 U. S. 455 (1973);]{.font4} [Palmore v. Sidoti,]{.font4} [-U.
S.]{.font4}[-, 104 S. Ct. 1879(1984).]{.sgc-4}

[If the First Amendment is not to protect those who have power against
the just claims of those who need equality; if pornography is sexual
exploitation and produces sexual abuse and discrimination; then the
Ordinance is more than justified. It saves our constitutional system
from the indignity of protecting sex-based abuse. It exonerates
principles of equity by allowing them vitality and potency. It shows
that law can actively help the powerless and not be paralyzed by the
cynical manipulations of sadists and profiteers. It is an appropriate
and carefully balanced response to a social harm of staggering
magnitude.]{.font4}

[in Support of Appellant Hudnut v. American Booksellers Association,
Inc.]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[INTRODUCTION]{.font4}

[The neighborhoods bordering on East Lake Street in South Minneapolis
have been fighting the encroachment of pornography into their community
since Ferris Alexander opened his first bookstore and theater on Chicago
Avenue and Lake Street in 1974. ^1(2)^ Concerned residents picketed
theaters, conducted tours of bookstores and waged a media campaign to
alert the public about the brutalization, violence and crime that
pornography was causing in their neighborhood. But, by 1976, Ferris
Alexander owned three adult bookstores on Lake Street and other
pornographers owned two more. Public pressure clearly had not succeeded.
Speech, as exercised by neighborhood groups, could not fight the money
and power of the pornographers.]{.font4}

[In 1976, residents approached the Minneapolis City Council and asked it
to pass a zoning law which would slow the growth of pornography in their
neighborhoods. They thought that "controlling" pornography through
zoning was their only legal option. The City Council passed a zoning
ordinance in 1976 which provided two restrictions on "adult uses.
"^2(3)^ First, no adult use could be operated within 500 feet of a
residentially zoned or office zoned district, a church, a licensed day
care facility, elementary or high schools, and public educational
facilities serving persons 17 or younger. §540. 410(c). Second, no adult
use could operate within 500 feet of another adult use. §540. 410(d).
The Eighth ]{.font4}[Circuit Court of Appeals found the ordinance
unconstitutional because it would have diminished the number of
pornographic bookstores and theaters.]{.font4 .sgc-3} [Alexander v. City
of Minneapolis,]{.font4 .sgc-3} [698 F. 2d 936 (8th Circuit; 1983).
Quoting from the lower court opinion, the Court said "\[Enforcement of
§540. 410 would have the effect of substantially reducing the number of
adult bookstores and theaters in Minneapolis, and no new adult
bookstores and theaters would be able to open. "]{.font4
.sgc-3} [Alexander v. City of Minneapolis,]{.font4 .sgc-3} [531 F. Supp.
1162, 1171 (D. Minn. 1982). The decision implied that pornography must
remain in some neighborhoods because it was already there. Indeed, the
Court assumed the burden of insuring that adult bookstores and theaters
have optimum economic advantage. Acknowledging the plaintiff's argument
that there were as few as three sites open for relocation if the
ordinance were passed and that these three sites were not economically
suitable for relocation, the Court said, "Because we find that the
twelve legally permissible relocation sites do not supply sufficient
access to the constitutionally protected adult uses in question we need
not look to their actual availability or economic feasibility or how
these factors would affect the constitutionality of the ordinance. " 698
F. 2d at 939, ftn. 7. The Eighth Circuit opinion confirmed what
neighborhood residents had begun to suspect: if zoning was the best the
legal system could offer, neighborhoods would never be able to rid
themselves of the blight and crime brought into their area of the city
by pornography.]{.font4 .sgc-3}

[1.     \[2.\] By 1975, Ferris Alexander and his brother owned or
controlled 21 adult bookstores and 8 theaters in the Twin Cities,
Rochester, and Duluth. Ferris Alexander was found guilty in 1973 of
"criminal conspiracy to transport obscene material across state lines. "
He was indicted in 1969. He served eight months and paid a \$20, 000
fine.]{.font3} [Twin Cities Reader,]{.font3} [September, 1980. The
Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than \$3. 4 million in back
taxes and penalties from Ferris Alexander, who the agency says has
earned more than \$2 million a year from businesses that include
pornographic bookstores and movie theaters in the Twin Cities. The IRS
asserts that Alexander's businesses had a combined gross income of \$5.
3 million for the years 1978 and 1979, including nearly \$2 million from
movie theater tickets alone. In its case against Ferris Alexander, the
IRS says that he reported only \$364, 000 in 1979.]{.font3} [Minneapolis
Star and Tribune]{.font3}[, February 12, 1984.]{.font3}

[2.     \[3.\] The ordinance identifies the following uses subject to
control: adults only bookstores, adults only picture theaters, massage
parlors, rap parlors, and saunas. Minneapolis Code of Ordinances § 540.
410(a); hereafter referred to as § 540. 410.]{.font3}

[From 1978 to 1983, while residents of South Minneapolis awaited a court
decision on the zoning law, conditions in the neighborhood worsened. The
harassment and intimidation experienced by women who live in
neighborhoods with a high concentration of pornography was documented
before the Minneapolis City Council during public hearings on the civil
rights ordinance on pornography. ^3141^ A woman from St. Paul who lived
in a neighborhood with two adult movie theaters and bookstores and one
adults only "club" testified that she had been propositioned several
times by men who were looking for prostitutes. She said that parents
fear for their children's safety and women who live in the neighborhood
feel unsafe, constantly vulnerable to harassment and rape by the
customers of the adult establishments.]{.font4}

[Residents of the neighborhoods bordering on East Lake Street in
Min]{.font4}[neapolis experience the same harassment and fear. The
presence- of two adult theaters, three adult bookstores and three saunas
on a thirteen block span by 1983 left them no choice but to be aware of
the pornography and of the harassment, intimidation and blight that is
associated with it. The crime rates, especially for prostitution related
offenses, are higher in the neighborhoods bordering on East Lake Street
than in other areas of the city (see Appendix A). The presence of adult
establishments has created a hostile and aggressive zone for women and
children. Women who live and work in the neighborhood are harassed and
propositioned by men who come into the neighborhoods to buy pornography
or to pay for sex. One woman who lives in the neighborhood stated: "I
get to work every day using the bus. The men who come out of this store
\[at 4th and Lake\] look you up and down in a very lewd gaze. It's
insulting to be treated like a prostitute when you're just waiting for a
bus. "^4151^ Women live in constant fear of rape because women are the
victims in areas with high crime and violence. Women who live in the
neighborhoods are not safe on their own streets at night. They cannot
shop, visit friends, wait for buses or buy groceries in peace. Women who
live outside the neighborhood also do not feel safe in coming there. The
aggression and violence around the adult establishments limits their
freedom to visit friends or to shop in the area. The fear, intimidation
and violence created by the saturation of pornography on East Lake
Street has had a concrete impact upon every woman in the neighborhood
and upon many women who live outside of it.]{.sgc-4}

[3.  \[4. \] Minneapolis City Council Government Operations Committee
Public Hearings on Ordinances to Add Pornography As Discrimination
Against Women, December 12-13, Session II, 90-100(1983).]{.font3}

[The adult establishments also affect the lives of children in the
neighborhood. They are forced to view the posters advertising such
movies as]{.font4} [Hot Dallas Nights]{.font4}[, and often can find
abandoned pornographic materials in the alleys behind adult bookstores.
Parents find it impossible to protect their children from the influence
of pornography and from the aggression of strangers.]{.font4}

[The adult bookstores and theaters which now line Lake Street have
indelibly marked the character of the business community. Once a
prosperous commercial area, East Lake Street now is characterized by
decline and deterioration. Many legitimate businesses have moved out of
the neighborhood and new ones have not replaced them. Business owners
are frightened by the real possibility of business failure. When women
do not feel safe on the streets, they will not come to the stores to
shop. ]{.font4}[Legitimate businesses do not want to subject their
employees, especially women employees, to harassment from the customers
of the adult bookstores and theaters.]{.sgc-4}

[4.  \[5. \]]{.font3} [Whittier Globe,]{.font3} [December 1980.]{.font3}

[People in this neighborhood are demoralized and increasingly cynical
about the fairness of the political process and of the legal system
itself. From 1976 to 1983, a group of over two hundred residents,
including single women, women with children, and men continued to meet
and discuss the problem of pornography in their neighborhood. When
Ferris Alexander began construction of another massage\* parlor on Lake
Street in the fall of 1983, they responded. Seven members of the
group---a health administrator at a local hospital, a community school
director, a local business person, the director of a neighborhood
organization, a school teacher, a law student, and a University of
Minnesota professor--- formed the Neighborhood Pornography Task Force
and asked the City Council to reintroduce a zoning law which they hoped
would prevent the opening of another "adults only" business on Lake
Street. Once again, they saw zoning law as their only option.]{.font4}

[The second Minneapolis experience with zoning was as unsuccessful as
the first. The citizens of South Minneapolis learned that political
clout and wealth determine who must bear the burden of pornography to
secure the "rights" of all. A city planner familiar with the history of
zoning in Minneapolis and with the legal standards required of zoning
plans proposed that seven commercial areas be zoned to allow adult
establishments. Four of the seven areas were on East Lake Street. One
was located in a predominantly white, wealthy area of the city.
Residents of that neighborhood vehemently opposed the ordinance. The
neighborhood around East Lake Street, because of its high concentration
of black, Native American, Southeast Asian and poor people, was
presumptively an acceptable target.]{.font4}

[The city council continued to work on a zoning strategy amidst heated
political controversy. None of the members of the city council wanted
pornography in their ward, but the initial zoning proposal would have
zoned part of]{.font4} [each]{.font4} [inner city ward for "adult"
establishments while protecting the more affluent, white districts of
the city. The city council could not ignore the problem. They scheduled
a public hearing on September 29, 1983, to give members of the community
a chance to express their opinion on the newly proposed zoning
ordinance. The Neighborhood Pornography Task Force asked Catharine
MacKinnon, a University of Minnesota law professor, and Andrea Dworkin,
a feminist writer, to testify at the public hearings on zoning. At the
time, MacKinnon and Dworkin were jointly teaching a class on pornography
at the University of Minnesota Law School. They suggested to the city
council that zoning strategies were the wrong approach to pornography
and that the city council should recognize that pornography is a form of
sex discrimination and a violation of women's civil rights.]{.font4}

[The testimony of MacKinnon and Dworkin at the public hearings on zoning
clarified for Amici that women and children were the real direct victims
of pornography. They had seen and experienced the abuse of women in
their neighborhood and witnessed the increased aggression and hostility
around them. They had looked at the pornographic magazines and books
that were as devastating as the decline in the quality of neighborhood
life around them: women were hung from light fixtures, whipped, chained,
mutilated and shit upon. Amici now recognized that the fundamental issue
is the right of all women to equality and freedom and that women are
denied exercise of those rights because of pornography.]{.font4}

[The Minneapolis City Council hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft a
civil rights ordinance on pornography. The ordinance describes exactly
what the members of the Neighborhood Pornography Task Force had seen in
the actual pornography that had been forced on them for years.
Pornography is: "the sexually explicit subordination of women,
graphically depicted whether in pictures or in words, that also includes
one or more of the following: (i) women are presented dehumanized as
sexual objects, things or commodities; or (ii) women are presented as
sexual objects who enjoy pain or humiliation; or (iii) women are
presented as sexual objects who experience sexual pleasure in being
raped; or (iv) women are presented as sexual objects tied up or cut up
or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women are presented
in postures of sexual submission or sexual servility, including by
inviting penetration; or (vi) women's body parts---including but not
limited to vaginas, breasts, or buttocks---are exhibited, such that
women are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented as whores
by nature; or (viii) women are presented being penetrated by objects or
animals; or (ix) women are presented in scenarios of degradation,
injury, or torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised, or
hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual. "]{.font4}

[The Minneapolis City Council passed the ordinance on December 30, 1983.
Mayor Donald Fraser vetoed it on January 5, 1984. It was immediately
reintroduced and the city council passed an amended version on July 13,
1984 which Mayor Fraser vetoed the same day. The Amendment passed by the
Indianapolis City Council on April 23, 1984 and amended on June 11, 1984
is substantially similar to the Minneapolis ordinance. The definition of
pornography in the Indianapolis ordinance, however, does not cover all
of the injuries of pornography as the Neighborhood Pornography Task
Force came to recognize them. In particular, the Amendment does not
contain the following subparts of the definition of pornography that the
Minneapolis ordinance contained: (i) women are presented dehumanized as
sexual objects, things or commodities; (v) women are presented in
postures of sexual submission or sexual servility, including by inviting
penetration; or (vi) women's body parts---including but not limited to
vaginas, breasts, or buttocks---are exhibited, such that women are
reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented as whores by
nature. The definition in the Amendment is narrower than the actual
injuries of pornography that the Neighborhood Pornography Task Force has
been fighting to combat and that the Minneapolis City Council recognized
as real when it covered them in its civil rights ordinance on
pornography. We say this to emphasize the extremely narrow nature of the
definition of the Indianapolis ordinance when measured against Amici's
actual experience with pornography.]{.font4}

[ARGUMENT]{.font4}

> [I.  Neighborhoods Are Not Protected by Zoning Laws]{.font4}

[Cities have a legitimate interest in preserving the character of their
neighborhoods and the quality of life for citizens who live in those
neighborhoods. In upholding a Detroit zoning ordinance addressing
pornography, the Court noted that the city's interest in attempting to
preserve the quality of urban life "is one that must be accorded high
respect. Moreover, the city must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to
experiment with solutions to admittedly serious problems. "]{.font4}
[Young v]{.font4}[.]{.font4} [American Mini Theaters,]{.font4} [427 U.
S. 50, 71 (1976). In the area of zoning law, the Court was even ready to
allow regulations which admittedly used the]{.font4} [content]{.font4}
[of the material as a basis for placing them in a different
classification from other motion pictures and books. They found that
"society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly
different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled
political debate that inspired Voltaire's immortal comment ('I
disapprove of what you say, but ]{.font4}[I will defend to the death
your right to say it. '). "]{.font4} [Young]{.font4}[, 427 U. S; at 70.
In the context of protection of neighborhoods, the Court recognized that
pornography, defined more broadly than obscenity and more broadly than
this Amendment, does not serve the underlying First Amendment value of
protecting political debate in the marketplace of ideas. The Court s
recognition that the State has a legitimate interest in the preservation
of neighborhoods was correct. Their support of zoning as a means to
achieve that end has not proved adequate.]{.font4}

[Zoning is not a neutral tool. Whenever a city zones pornography out of
one neighborhood, they must zone it]{.font4} [into]{.font4} [another
neighborhood. Some neighborhoods are thus protected at the expense of
other neighborhoods. In]{.font4} [Young]{.font4}[, the Court condemns
some neighborhoods to endure blight and deterioration for material that
they recognized as worthless.]{.font4}

[The decision about where adult bookstores and theaters are located is
deeply rooted in already existing social and political inequalities.
Those without power, especially racially and ethnically disenfranchised
portions of the population, are consistently victimized. Those with
power and money insist that the material be protected, yet refuse to
allow it in their neighborhoods. Many come to the pornography districts,
buy pornography and live women, and then return to the more affluent
areas of the city where they live. Those who live in the pornography
districts cannot escape. In Minneapolis, these citizens are primarily
poor people and people of color\... They do not have the power or the
resources to keep the pornography that the law protects out of their
neighborhoods. The pornography is protected, but they are not.]{.font4}

[Under present interpretation of the Constitution, certain individuals
must be bombarded with pornography, harassed on the street, and forced
to live in a disreputable part of town, because other people claim the
right to view material that they will fight to keep out of their own
neighborhoods. Zoning supports pornography. Any zoning law must be
interpreted as an affirmative statement by city leaders that they want
pornography in poor and minority neighborhoods.]{.font4}

[The language in court decisions on zoning indicating a desire to
protect neighborhoods must therefore be regarded as inaccurate at best,
as deliberately misleading at worst. Zoning laws hurt neighborhoods far
more than they help. They create an illusion that the legal system is
addressing the problem of pornography, when in truth, it does not. Urban
citizens, like those of South Minneapolis, are led to believe that
zoning laws and obscenity laws are the only options open to them. When
those tools prove ineffective, they have been told that nothing else can
be done. This undermines faith in government and contributes to the
cynical perception that the law can pretend to recognize a harm and
provide a remedy while actually covering up the harm and providing no
relief at all.]{.font4}

[As long as the material itself remains free from judicial scrutiny, any
laws which limit the availability of presumably protected materials will
be unconstitutional. The courts must decide whether pornography serves
the underlying values of the First Amendment and is entitled to full
First Amendment protection. Skirting the issue through zoning laws or
obscenity laws is not acceptable when individuals and entire communities
are daily being injured because of pornography.]{.font4}

> [II.  The State Has a Legitimate Interest in Protecting Residents of
> Neighborhoods with a High Concentration of Pornography Through a Civil
> Rights Ordinance on Pornography]{.font4}

[The defense of pornography rests upon principles that are antithetical
to the premises of democratic government. The Fourteenth Amendment to
the Constitution says that a state may not "deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. " It is a
statement by our government that equal treatment of all citizens ranks
as a high priority and that the state may not constitutionally enforce
laws which classify certain individuals for treatment that denies them
life, liberty or property.]{.font4}

[The enforcement of zoning laws which force pornography upon poor and
minority neighborhoods denies the residents of those neighborhoods their
right to equal protection under the law. When the State insists that
pornography must remain in certain neighborhoods, it denies liberty to
the women who live there, yet are afraid to walk on the streets at night
to visit friends or neighborhood stores. It denies liberty to women
outside the neighborhood who are afraid to come into a hostile and
crime-ridden area after dusk. Women become second class citizens who
cannot exercise freedom of association because of the conditions of
pornography. The State also denies a decent quality of life to residents
who must daily confront the urban blight, crime and violence that have
entered their neighborhood with the adult bookstores and theaters. The
individuals who live in these neighborhoods are singled out for special
treatment because they live in certain neighborhoods which city
officials have decided are unworthy of protection from the harms of
pornography that they actively seek to eliminate from wealthy,
politically powerful neighborhoods. The residents of South Minneapolis
who cannot afford to move are individually and collectively hurt because
of their residential status.]{.font4}

[Indianapolis City-Council General Ordinance No. 35, 1984 might be
interpreted to provide a remedy for the individuals who have pornography
forced on them because of the discriminatory application of zoning laws.
An individual who was forced to look at pornography could sue the
perpetrator and/or the institution who was forcing pornography on them
under Section 1. Sec. 16-3(g)(6) which provides a cause of action for
the forcing of pornography on any woman, man, child\' or transsexual in
any place of employment, in education, in a home, or in any public
place. The individual would have to prove that the material in question
met the definition of pornography set forth in the Amendment and that
force was included. An injunction against the further forcing of the
pornography could be obtained if all the elements of the case were
proven.]{.font4}

[Residents of South Minneapolis could also use the trafficking provision
of the Amendment to sue the sellers and exhibitors of pornography who
are denying neighborhood residents privacy and safety and profiting from
trafficking in women. If a citizen could prove that something met the
definition of pornography in the Amendment and that it was not an
isolated passage or an isolated part of the work as a whole, they could
get an injunction against the further sale or exhibition of the
material, as well as damages from sellers and/or exhibitors. There is
presently no other way to make the sellers and exhibitors responsible
for the harm that they are causing to neighborhoods. This Amendment,
rather than leaving neighborhood residents with legal remedies that have
no effect upon the problems that plague them, empowers citizens to take
action in a socially responsible and legal way to improve the condition
of their lives. Good laws create legal remedies that closely match the
injuries being addressed. The Amendment provides a more effective remedy
than either zoning or obscenity laws because it directly meets the needs
of neighborhood residents in deteriorating, crime-ridden neighborhoods
without any other current possibility of legal relief.]{.font4}

[The Amendment is also more effective because it acknowledges that the
government has the]{.font4} [right]{.font4} [and the]{.font4}
[power]{.font4} [to provide legal remedies for actual injuries under a
narrow and carefully drawn definition of pornography and to draft local
legislation which it believes will move us toward achieving equality for
all citizens, including women and neighborhood residents who live in the
zones surrounding "adult" establishments. Defenders of pornography often
argue that there are no grounds upon which pornography can be
distinguished from other forms of speech. Justice Brennan, in dissent
in]{.font4} [Paris Adult Theaters v. Slaton,]{.font4} [413 U. S. 49, 84
(1973) stated that "\[a\]ny effect to draw a constitutionally acceptable
boundary of state power must resort to such indefinite concepts as
'prurient interest, ' 'patent offensiveness, ' 'serious literary value'
and the like. The meaning of these concepts necessarily varies with the
experience, outlook and idiosyncrasies of the person defining them. "
Judges assume there \[are\] an infinite number of standards, which is
the same as saying there]{.font4} [are]{.font4} [no standards. The
defenders of pornography accordingly argued that all forms of
expression, whether in politics, art or pornography are equally
legitimate. In this view, the only principle acceptable in a democratic
government is that there]{.font4} [are no principles]{.font4} [on which
to say that one publication is more damaging or dangerous than any
other.]{.font4}

[This view is incorrect. We have never assumed that the law cannot
intrude to protect the life, health and safety of its citizens. "What is
government itself, " asked Madison, "but the greatest of all reflections
of human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary.
"]{.font4} [The Federalist,]{.font4} [\#51 (New York: Modern Library, n.
d. ), p. 37. A government that sought to abolish any consideration of
principles would not be worthy of being called a government. Elected and
appointed officials are invested with an obligation to do far more than
preserve the security of citizens, although pornography does threaten
that. They are also charged with insuring justice and equality.]{.font4}

[The Neighborhood Pornography Task Force wants its government to insure
justice and equality for all citizens, especially women, because it
believes that no one will be free until we all are free. It wants this
court to recognize the injustice of pornography and to uphold an
Amendment which provides legal recourse to its victims. Many of those
who deny the government's power to recognize the injustice of
pornography or its ability to rectify those injustices are the same
people who want statutes prohibiting discrimination in housing or
education, or criminalizing the selling of children and wife battering.
As Justice Burger noted in]{.font4} [Paris Adult Theaters,]{.font4}
["\[s\]tates are told by some that they must await a 'laissez-faire'
market solution to the obscenity-pornography problem, paradoxically by
people who have never otherwise had a kind word to say for
'laissez-faire\' particularly in solving urban, commercial and
environmental pollution problems.]{.font4} [Idea in America]{.font4} [37
(1972). " One must ask why material that graphically, brutally and
systematically subordinates women sexually must remain forever beyond
the bounds of legal remedy?]{.font4}

[Releasing controls over pornography \'will not cause it to diminish in
quantity or in violence toward women. As long as small producers can
make a film like]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4} [for \$25, 000 and bring
in a return of \$50 million in the first few years, ^5\[6\]^ there will
be a strong incentive to make them. As long as pictures can be taken of
a wom\[a\]n while she is being raped, and sold on the commercial
pornography market as protected free speech, men will continue to rape
women and sell the pictures of the rape to pornographers. And as long as
the pornography industry is as large as it is, women will be coerced
into making it. The industry could not exist without coercion.
^6\[7\]^]{.font4}

[By refusing to act, the legal system assents to the brutal torture of
women and children in pornography. It assents to the forced
deterioration of neighborhoods. It assents to the denial of a decent
quality of life for the poor and non-white who must live in
neighborhoods with a high concentration of pornography. It assents to
the legitimization of rape, battery and sexual abuse of women. It
assents to and encourages the proliferation of pornography in a culture
that is already highly pornographic. ^7\[8\]^ Allowing pornographers the
right to express themselves through trafficking in women means that the
state has]{.font4} [chosen]{.font4} [to protect pornographers'
individual rights over women's rights to dignity, equality and freedom
and over the rights of citizens in neighborhoods like South Minneapolis
to a decent quality of life.]{.font4}

because a huge national market exists for such materials. Consumers have
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to see these magazines, films and
videos. Given the enormous profit of such productions, elimination of
this type of coercion will require Government action to reduce demand. "

[CHAIR STELLA OHANESIAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And now I'd like to go on to
the set item that is at 11: 00 o'clock. And as you know, we have had
public hearings before, and as many of you know we have been studying
this issue for the past 8 months. Now there are those here today that
have not had the opportunity, or were not aware of the impact of this
proposed ordinance, and have requested an opportunity to testify. For
that reason, and because we want to hear all points of view, and be fair
to all, we scheduled this item on our agenda again. Now our concern is
that this ordinance be ]{.font4}[legal and enforceable, and we know that
our issue is legitimate and needed. Therefore, as I said before, for
those of you who have not signed in, if you will please sign in and
identify yourself and your affiliation, and restrict your presentation
to three minutes so that everyone will have an opportunity to be heard.
And also, in the interest of time, I will ask that the commissioners
hold their questions until all have testified. And again, in order to
make it move perhaps a little more evenly, I would like to suggest that
we have three that are in favor of the ordinance speak, and then three
that are opposed to the ordinance speak, if there is no objection to
that. All right.]{.sgc-4}

[COMMISSIONER 2:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Also, as a public commission, your
testimony is being recorded and is a matter of public record.]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER 3:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to suggest that it be
reversed, and start out with three who are opposed to the ordinance and
then three who are in favor.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right.]{.font4}

[COMMISSIONER 3:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Because I think there are so many
people who have expressed dissatisfaction, and I'd like to hear them
first.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right,\... if there is no objection\... We
are going to have one opposing speaker and one speaker in favor of until
we have gone through all of them. And as time permits, of course. You
will state your name and your affiliation.]{.font4}

[SYLVIA GENTILLY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Sylvia Gentilly. I am from
the Wages for House \[Work\] Campaign, and I have been asked by U. S.
Prostitutes Collective to read a statement, and it is within your time
frame, I hope\.... This statement has been endorsed by Black Women for
Wages for Housework, Rape Action Project, North American Network of
Women Runners, Eighties Ladies, Wages to Lesbians, No Bad Women---Just
Bad Laws. USPO is opposed to the Los Angeles County Anti-Pornography
Ordinance. We are not proposing a change in the wording of the
ordinance. We think the entire concept is going in the wrong direction.
We know that even without passage of the ordinance, sex industry workers
are already feeling an increased violence against them by men who think
they've got society's approval to "hunt down hookers. " Women who have
worked very hard to get away from pimps are being forced back into
dependence on pimps, hoping for some form of protection against these
attacks. Women are being brutalized and raped at the hands of some
abusive police who operate as though they had the approval of society,
including some feminists. The debate alone on the ordinance has caused
sex industry workers the price of increased violence and increased
dependence on pimps. Surely the County Commission and Board of
Supervisors cannot be for giving more business to pimps. If the
ordinance is passed, some of the places where sex industry workers are
employed will be forced underground, and the workers will be forced
underground along with the businesses. It is unrealistic to expect that
if sex industry businesses are closed, their workers will automatically
find other jobs. USPO has found that the majority of sex industry
workers are single mothers with families to support. Some are working
regular jobs, but that's not enough to make ends meet. Juveniles who run
away from home, where many are being raped and physically or
psychologically abused, have nowhere to go.]{.font4}

[The anti-porn ordinance won't solve the problems these kids face but
will compound them. We often hear the sex industry workers bring crime
into the neighborhood, that they are hooked on drugs, that they spread
VD. First of all, the U. S. Department of Health has found that
only]{.font4} [5%]{.font4} [of VD can be traced to prostitutes.
Secondly, drug dependence among sex industry workers is no higher than
among other sectors of society. Thirdly, most of the sex industry
workers, according to the U. S. Attorney General's office, is not
controlled by organized crime. In fact, the antiporn ordinance's
creation of another underground industry will pave the way for organized
crime to move in.]{.font4}

[Women work in the sex industry because they need the money, not because
they like the sex. If they are forced to work underground, they will be
forced to do more work, use their bodies more, and be required to work
in prostitution. They could be forced to do porn shows that they are
currently refusing, because that's the way for owners of these
businesses to make it worthwhile for them to operate an illegal
business.]{.font4}

[If it is an anti-pornography ordinance that sends sex workers
underground in the first place, it's absurd to think that they will soon
be \[suing\] if they object to the working conditions. The porn
ordinance will force the closure of some indoor sex industry operations.
What happens when these closures take place, as has happened in
Sacramento, is an automatic increase in street prostitution, because
women have to find a way to eat, pay the rent, feed and clothe their
children. Increases in street prostitution mean more police crackdowns
that are usually ineffective, as well as costly to the taxpayer, and
more pimps. In fact, the statistics point to the enforcement of
prostitution laws as selective and racist, with the majority of those
jailed for prostitution being Black women. Therefore these crackdowns
can immediately be seen as an attack on the Black communities, where
unemployment is high, and few options are available for young Black
people.]{.font4}

[Many women in USPROS network are Black, and are particularly concerned
about the use of "enforcing the porn ordinance" to further harass the
Black community. Feminists who support the porn ordinance say they are
not attacking prostitutes, yet the ordinance explicitly calls for the
enforcement of the prostitution laws.^1^ They can't have it both
ways.]{.font4}

[1 The ordinance does not call for enforcement of prostitution
laws.]{.sgc-14}

[The anti-porn ordinance blames porn for problems we face as
women---discrimination, violence, rape, harassment. We disagree. Poverty
causes these problems. The present cuts in welfare, food stamps, health
and other human services are increasing the number of sex industry
workers, while other women are forced to take low-paying, dead-end jobs.
Many of us are forced to put up with sexually and physically abusive
husbands, to tolerate lecherous bosses, to keep quiet about rape and
sexual assaults.]{.font4}

[Instead of spending so much time and money on an ordinance that will
harm those most vulnerable among us, why not put the resources instead
into establishing homes for juvenile runaways, tuition decreases so that
women aren't forced into the sex industry to put themselves through
school, as they are currently doing; increased welfare payments so that
prostitution doesn't have to pick up the slack for inadequate payments;
funding more low or no-cost child care programs, so that women aren't
forced into the sex industry to pay for the kind of quality child care
they want for their children; increased availability of decent
low-income housing; elimination of wage differentials among men and
women. As long as women are earning 47 cents to every dollar that a man
earns, as is true in California, you will find women in the sex
industry. Support the inclusion of women's financial contribution to the
economy in the gross national product, so that we aren't always viewed
as scroungers when we win payments for services.]{.font4}

[In other words, get to the roots of the problem that creates the
situation where women are vulnerable and therefore exploited in the porn
industry. Some who support the ordinance try to get support for their
claim by listing how difficult and dangerous it is to be in the sex
industry. It is difficult and dangerous, however, the anti-porn
ordinance will not solve these problems, but compound them. Band-aid
solutions like the anti-porn ordinance just won't work. Worse yet, it
will increase the violence, coercion and oppression of women who are the
first affected by such an ordinance: sex industry workers.]{.font4}

[I'd like to commend you first for your stance and the courage it took
to take that stance. One defense of pornography maintains that it is
only a form of fantasy, not of action. Like other forms of speech then,
it must be protected against encroachment on inner freedom. People
should be allowed the freedom of their thoughts and fantasies. The
perspective from which this is defended is a Freudian one, and Freud's
discoveries about the nature of fantasy are often called upon in
conjunction with Freudian thinking about women and sexuality. But if we
subject Freud's thinking about the nature of sexual fantasies to a more
searching examination, particularly in the light of the new documents
that have recently become available---I'm referring to my edition of the
Freud-Fliess letters which was published this month by Harvard
University Press^2^---what is most striking is how far removed Freud's
views were from the true state of affairs.]{.font4}

[Freud argued that almost all of his women patients' lives were
dominated by the fantasy that their father had sexually abused them. At
first Freud thought this fantasy was a historical reality: a traumatic
memory from childhood. But later he decided he had been misled by the
women, who had been impelled to create these fantasies because of the
nature of female sexuality. Let us listen briefly to Freud on the
question directly, writing in 1925 in his autobiographical
study:]{.font4}

> [Before going further into the question of infantile sexuality, I must
> mention an error into which I fell for a while, and which might well
> have had fatal consequences for the whole of my work. Under the
> influence of the technical procedure which I used at that time, the
> majority of my patients reproduce from their childhood, scenes in
> which they were sexually seduced by some grown up person. With female
> patients, the part of the seducer was almost always assigned to their
> father. I believed these stories, and consequently supposed that I had
> discovered the roots of the subsequent neurosis and these experiences
> of sexual seduction in childhood. If the reader feels inclined to
> shake his head at my credulity, I cannot altogether blame him. When,
> however, I was at last obliged to recognize that these scenes of
> seduction had never taken place, that they were only fantasies which
> my patients had made up, which I myself had perhaps forced on them, I
> was for some time completely at a loss. ^3^]{.font4}

[3. Sigmund Freud, An Autobiographical Study (The Hogarth Press, 1959),
pp. 33-34.]{.font3 .sgc-15}

[Freud's view expressed in this passage---that women invent, out of
sexual needs, memories of sexual seduction---has dominated psychiatric
and psychological thinking for eighty years. It has dominated as well
most major defenses of pornography. It is only in the last few years
that women have begun questioning Freud's reasoning. Their criticisms
have escalated as we achieve an ever-greater awareness of the reality of
sexual abuse in the childhood of many women. On top of this growing
knowledge of the reality of abuse came the discovery from the Freud
Archives, many of which I published in]{.font4} [The Assault on
Truth,]{.font4} [that Freud himself knew that sexual abuse was extremely
pervasive in his day, and that it was not fantasy, but reality. However,
the theory of fantasy was far more acceptable to the male-dominated
medical society of his day. Had Freud stood by his women patients, he
would have been totally isolated from his male colleagues, for he would
have been criticizing not only their blindness, but also the society
they lived in. And in those days, it was simply unthinkable for women
who had survived incest to come together and support one another. It was
too shameful and deep a secret. But thanks to the women's movement in
this country, women are getting together for the first time and saying
that it really does happen, and in numbers that make it apparent that we
are dealing with one of the most serious problems of current
society.]{.font4}

[Freud's views about fantasy have been, for the women who know about the
reality of abuse, totally discredited. While we may not entirely
understand Freud's motivation for his about-face, there can be no doubt
that sexual abuse was a reality in his day, as it is in ours, and that
the women who came to Freud were not inventing stories, as he claims,
but telling him about a painful reality.]{.font4}

[Pornography is a record of that same reality, of those very acts that
Freud claimed did not exist. By shifting the blame for the reality of
incest on the inventive power of the woman, saying that it was her wish,
her fantasy, Freud provided many men with a convenient explanation for
the occasions that from time to time surfaced. They could be dismissed
as the accusations of "hysterical" women, women who were---^4^]{.font3

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Masson, it is time. If you could make it
brief, please.]{.font4}

[MASSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [OK, I'm sorry. All right, I'll end by simply
saying that pornography in my opinion is the expression of sexual abuse,
no more a fantasy than sexual abuse is a fantasy. Thank you very
much.]{.font4}

[[4. \[The remainder of the statement reads).. sexually needy, and
turned for satisfaction to a perverted imagination. Now that we know,
today, that this is not so, what has happened to Freud's theories about
fantasy? They have not been discarded, they have simply shifted ground.
Now, we are told, they are helpful in understanding the nature of
pornography. But I entreat you to consider that we may be faced with yet
another example of men who exploit and harm women attempting to cover up
what they really do by calling it something else. It is not surprising
that the philosophy of sexual liberation would call upon Freud's ideas
about fantasy, by pretending to protect the rights of women and children
to their sexual fantasies. But these were never, according to the
historical record, the fantasies of women and children, rather they are
the acts of men imposed in reality upon protesting but powerless women
and children. I would go further than the feminists who say pornography
is the theory, rape the practice, and say that pornography is already
the practice. Pornography, in my opinion, is the expression of sexual
abuse. It is no more a fantasy than sexual abuse is a fantasy. It is a
problem of male psychology, and while women may have an obligation to
explain it, they are surely under no obligation to tolerate its
persistence. Pornography is an act, and one that abuses women by its
very existence. To tolerate pornography under the guise of protecting
freedom of expression, of- freedom of thought, or freedom of fantasy, is
to subscribe to a view of fantasy that has no basis in reality, and has
simply served as yet another instrument of women's subjugation. I urge
you to think about it more deeply than the Freudians have."]{.sgc-12}\
]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And for the opposing point of view.]{.font4}

[BETTY BROOKS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Our statement \[is\] from FACT. I also
have a statement from the National Task Force on Prostitution. As the
representative from the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force, Los
Angeles, I wish to register publicly and clearly our opposition to the
anti-pornography civil rights law proposed by the Los Angeles Commission
on the Status of Women to the Board of Supervisors. Such a law would
create a private cause of action for a violation of civil rights,
allowing an individual to bring a civil suit if that individual was
offended by pornography as defined in the law.]{.font4}

[Individually and collectively, we stand committed to the principles of
feminism and progressive social reform. We are activists dedicated to
eradicating sexism and violence against women, ending the physical and
psychological victimization of children, and achieving true sex equity
and the freedom of choice in the pursuit and enjoyment of alternative
lifestyles and sexual preferences which do not do violence to others. It
is in fact precisely this commitment we share that compels us to oppose
this proposed law, for in its enactment lies the frightening possibility
that the very goals of feminism to which we are committed may themselves
become the victim of retaliation through the unintended but entirely
allowable use of such a law and its concept by those who hold the
attitudes it seeks to repudiate.]{.font4}

[Evidence of this unsettling prospect can be found in the support for
this approach and these ordinances by forces who do not seek sex equity
for women. These forces assisted in the passage of the Minneapolis and
the Indianapolis ordinances and totally changed the concept of the
ordinance in Suffolk County, New York. We acknowledge that this approach
on its face does not ban pornography, however it is defined, from public
availability and view. Nonetheless, this law treads on the dangerous
ground of specifying what material is appropriate for people in a
democratic society to view.]{.font4}

[We concur with the assessment by County Council, LA Women Lawyers'
Association, and other competent legal experts that the legality and
constitutionality of this type of law are highly suspect. This issue
will probably only be decided with any certainty by a review and ruling
by the U. S. Supreme Court, but such a prospect causes us concern, given
the distinctly conservative bent of the Court's rulings in recent years.
With the likelihood of vacancies in the near future, we are concerned
that those vacancies may be filled by justices who satisfy the current
fundamentalist urge to redefine, in a sweeping manner, what is moral and
immoral, pure and obscene, decent and pornographic, and right for women
to be in this society.]{.font4}

[We do not seek to stifle public debate of this issue. In fact it has
been our effort to respond to those who had presented feminists as
favoring this law. All feminists do not favor this law. We were not
asked to submit formal evidence in opposition to this proposed law by
the County Commission on the Status of Women, nor have we been invited
to submit alternative proposals to the Council for ending violence
against women. Therefore, we request that this proposed law be defeated,
and before any such proposals be reworked or redefined, that a vigorous
public debate be supported by the Board and the Commission considering
economic feasibility, community support, and constitutionality.]{.font4}

[We also recommend, and this is not in the statement, that in fact the
Commission in fact do further work on the health manual, which is a
positive point of view of human sexuality, and begin to work on some
positive measures, rather than---]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Dr. Brooks, can you make it brief,
please\....]{.font4}

[BROOKS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Community education is essential to the health
of our society and its citizens. Recognizing this, we acknowledge that
few resources have been devoted to bringing about individual and social
change as it relates to the issues surrounding pornography. But while we
see the need to expand these efforts, we cannot accept such approaches
as this one, one which allows individuals to use their personal
preference to decide for all others what we should say, should read, or
be seen, one which provides an official government standard of what
would be permitted to exist in our minds, one which attempts to empower
one group to silence another simply as a matter of personal choice, one
which seeks to regulate thought, expression and ideas\.... Thank
you\...]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And in favor of the ordinance,
\[Anonymous\].]{.font4}

[UNIDENTIFIED COMMISSIONER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What are these that you are
passing out?]{.font4}

[ANONYMOUS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am appearing before the Commission as a
private citizen, and would ask that my name be deleted from the public
record to protect my privacy and the privacy of other innocent
victims.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [You do realize this is being taped.]{.font4}

[ANONYMOUS:]{.font7 .sgc-1}  [I do realize that it's being taped. I
would like my name deleted from the record.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [All right.]{.font4}

[ANONYMOUS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm here today to tell you that it
shouldn't hurt to be a woman.]{.font4}

[I'm here today to tell you that pornography is a problem that is not a
problem that is restricted to those in poverty. The trafficking in
pornography is so pervasive that it extends to victims that live in
hundred-thou-sand-dollar homes, in the suburbs, in nice neighborhoods,
the nice families, people that are married to minister's sons.]{.font4}

[It's been my personal experience that I had to find the collection that
you're looking at. It's been my personal experience that I've had to
look into the faces of those women and know that someone that I care
about has cut me out of his life because of reliance on his
five-fingered lover and the centerfolds in those books. Anyone that
tells me that pornography is not desensitizing, so that a man would
choose a unidimensional, glossy, ten-and-a-half by
twenty-four-and-a-half-inch centerfold with a staple in her navel over a
real live, flesh-and-blood wife, who would do anything in her power to
please him, doesn't understand the depth of the despair of those that
are victimized by this.]{.font4}

[Victims of this are cut off by society---nobody wants to hear what our
secret is. I think a bill like this gives victims in our society, a
society that protects those that are harmed by having actionable
recourse to courts, should be protected by the type of legislation that
you're putting forward. We \[need\] to be able to protect ourselves, and
also the innocent children who can also become party to this terrible,
terrible tragedy\.... Thank you.]{.font4}

[ROSEMARY PAGOSLEV:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Rosemary Pagoslev, and I
speak on behalf of Bread and Roses Bookstore, where I have been employed
throughout some of the time I was in law school\....]{.font4}

[As a long time feminist, I am pained by the tone of controversy among
feminists over this issue, and I sympathize with the plight of the
Commission in having to make a decision where there are strong women on
both sides of the issue who are asking you to go for their side. As a
woman, and the mother of a daughter, I am concerned about violence
against women. I myself was raped when I was seventeen, and I'm sure
that there are many violent forces in the society that could be stopped
if the right form were found to stop them. But I think that pornography
is a jellyfish. When we see it on the beach it looks shiny, when you get
up close to it, it looks slimy, and when you try to touch your hands on
it, it stings like hell.]{.font4}

[We are opposed to the ordinance. As booksellers, we are especially
concerned about the possible passage of an ordinance that would
seriously impair the right of our citizens to read the literature of our
choice, and those citizens that we are speaking of are the women of Los
Angeles. If you enter any ordinary bookstore---Crown or Dalton's---you
will see books filled with men's concerns and men's names. Women's entry
into the world of publishing has been very recent, and with a few major
exceptions, has been primarily of only the greatest, and among those,
women who were using men's names in order to get published. Just as
women's literature has been late coming into the mainstream, books about
women's concerns have been absent from the bookshelves. Most bookstores,
when they have a women's section, are talking about books to do with
pregnancy and child care, and a lot of those are written by
men.]{.font4}

[We believe that this ordinance is vague and unconstitutional. When
there was the hearing at the County Board of Supervisors, one of the
supervisors said that he didn't care if it was unconstitutional, that
they would fight it out in the courts. What we are concerned about is
the effect that this ordinance will have on women if it goes through,
while they fight it out in the courts, trying to find out if it's
unconstitutional.]{.font4}

[We are afraid that our civil liberties will be attacked. We are afraid
that what happened to us in December at the bookstore, which is, we had
a display of books on sexuality in the window, the window was broken and
all those books were torn up. We are afraid that if this ordinance goes
through, women's bookstores will become like the abortion clinics, a
target for terrorism from people who think that they are fighting a holy
war.]{.font4}

[And finally, I would like to say, to remind you of the words of the
poet Heinrich Heine, who said, "wherever they burn books, they will also
in the end burn human beings. " Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And in favor of the ordinance, we have Pauline
Bart.]{.font4}

[PAULINE BART:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm Dr. Pauline Bart. I'm a visiting
professor of sociology in women's studies at UCLA, the school from which
I obtained my Ph. D., and a visiting scholar at the Law School at UCLA.
In the fall, I was \[a\] visiting scholar at Harvard Law School. It is
because I am a rape researcher---my last study was based on interviews
with 94 women who had been raped, or whom somebody had tried to
rape---as well as a woman, a mother, a grandmother, that I support this
ordinance.]{.font4}

[It is because I have been studying the law
that[]{#losAngeles.xhtml#footnote5}^[5](#losAngeles.xhtml#bookmark6)^ I
know the difference between obscenity law and this ordinance. And this
is why I support the ordinance.]{.font4}

[It is because many of the women who were raped \[in my study\] were
told, some with a gun or a knife at their neck or their head, that they
were going to enjoy it, and they were told that they had to tell their
assailant how much they were enjoying it. One such woman who was a
professor of philosophy was told to "have an orgasm" with a gun to her
head. It is because these women told me that it was harder to tell their
assailants that they enjoyed the rape than enduring the actual assault
itself, it is because of these women who shared these experiences with
me, that I support the ordinance.]{.font4}

[It is because when a potential rapist tried to pull my 75-year-old
mother into his car in Santa Barbara, telling her what a good time he
was going to show her, and she was able to get away and memorize the
license plate number of the car, and went to the police, and they didn't
believe her, and they did pick up the man, and it was only when he
skipped bail that even the people she knew, her friends, believed her,
and because this is the message that pornography sends out, that I
support the ordinance.]{.font4}

[I have been talking with women who have been raped, or have been
attacked and avoided rape, for approximately the past ten years, and it
is to make their suffering meaningful, that it may be used so that other
women will not have to endure this, that I support the
ordinance.]{.font4}

[It is because I am a researcher on pornography as well as on rape, and
because having read pornography I have read many of the excellent
studies on its effects, and knowing that pornography is pro-rape
propaganda, that I support the ordinance.]{.font4}

[It is because Diana Scully, a professor of sociology at Virginia
Commonwealth University, who has been talking to rapists who are
imprisoned, wrote the following that I support the ordinance. She wrote
a letter to Gary Meltzer, the City Attorney of Los Angeles:]{.font4}

> [Per your request, enclosed are copies of two papers presenting my
> research on convicted rapists which might be useful in your
> deliberation on the anti-pornography proposal. You will note that the
> relationship I draw between rape and pornography is indirect but
> powerful. That is, violent pornography trivializes rape and encourages
> men to think of violence as a part of normal sexual relations. It also
> provides the language which men can and do use to neutralize and
> justify their sexually violent behavior. When rapists I studied told
> me that despite the injuries they have been inflicting on their

> projected in pornography. Essentially their culture had taught them to

> County of Los Angeles, decides to act in favor of this

[It is because Professor Diana Russell found that 10 percent of the
women in her sample drawn from San Francisco households who had been
asked to do, or demanded to do, something that they did not want to do
because the person asking them had read about it in pornography---and
this is just the tip of the iceberg; there had been many women who had
been pressured to do things that didn't know that it came from
pornography---that I support the ordinance.]{.font4}

[SANDRA HALE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm Sandra Hale. I teach women's studies
at Cal. State, Long Beach, and I want to say\... that I have taught
against pornography for a very long time\.... But since then, some
events have changed my life and have turned me around with regard to
anti-porn ordinances.]{.font4}

[I'm speaking to you as the Director of Women's Studies at Cal. State,
Long Beach, who was stripped of the directorship in 1982 for refusing to
fire, or more correctly not rehire, part-time faculty under attack from
right-wing fundamentalists. My opposition to the anti-pornography
ordinance comes out of this experience of\* teaching women's studies at
CSULB, a liberated program still under attack. Fundamentalists'
objections to classroom ideas and texts precipitated an unprecedented
purge of feminist faculty and created a demoralizing chill in our
classrooms. Those of us who teach or taught at CSULB know who will be
the first to lose basic freedoms if this ordinance or others like it are
passed.]{.font4}

[Pornography and the degradation of and violence against women must be
stopped, but as I was quoted in the LA Times as saying, "The strategies
we use must not abridge our freedoms. " In February, 1982, a complaint
by fundamentalists was lodged with me, then Director, against faculty
teaching our Health, Bodies and Sexuality courses. Specifically, the
complaint was directed at Professor Betty Brooks for her alleged use of
pornographic material and her advocacy of lesbianism. And then, after
viewing the African liberation posters on my office wall, they later
broadened the complaint to include Marxist revolutionary thought. We
later learned that members of the Grace Brethren Church of Long Beach
and California Eagle Forum had been collecting the titles of our
textbooks for over one year before that. Jessica Shaver, the spokeswoman
of the time, indicated to me that she had taken two of Professor Brooks'
texts to the police, to the Veterans' Administration, to the hospital
across the way, and also had complained to the campus bookstore about
carrying those books. She was attempting, she said, to have the
books---which were]{.font4} [Our Bodies]{.font4}[,]{.font4} [Our
Selves]{.font4}[, and]{.font4} [Sapphistry]{.font4}[---deemed
pornographic and censored from sale from the bookstore. She was hoping
to show that Professor Brooks was selling pornography to minors, that
is, if anyone in her class was 17 years old. She also was attempting to
show that by reading the books in question, students were being
encouraged to do physically harmful things to themselves. After I
informed Shaver and her committee that a teacher has the right to use
any book or ideas in a university classroom, she and the committee took
the complaint to the University president. The rest is academic history.
The ACLU has taken our case, claiming it is one of the most significant
free speech cases in decades.]{.font4}

[Our program at CSULB was not unusually radical. In fact, we're nearly
identical in curriculum and faculty styles to San Francisco State and
Sacramento State. But we were considered in the vanguard of sexuality
courses. Now, with all the changes, we offer fewer sections of Women and
Their Bodies. We have had to cancel a course entitled Women's
Sexuality\....]{.font4}

[What I'm asking of you is that the ordinance, if passed, would make us
very vulnerable to a suit. In fact, Schlafly's Eagle Forum, the chair of
the California Eagle Forum is already suing the California state
university system for allowing an illegal women's studies program to
exist, citing some of our literature. And I have given you a list of
those books that they are attempting to censor. We implore you
therefore, not to give them any more weapons in which to file such suits
against us. We are in favor of opposing pornography, but within a
feminist framework. Thank you very much\....]{.font4}

[TOBY SUMMER:]{.font7 .sgc-1}[\... I was born and raised in Los Angeles.
I've been a lesbian for twenty-five years. It cost me an education that
I never got. And part of the result was that I wound up being a hooker.
I did it on Sunset Boulevard in Santa Monica, in Venice, in Whittier,
and this is the first time I have told anybody.]{.font4}

[I would like to submit for you something that I bought today, so you
know what I'm talking about. For you, my money, for your knowledge. I
have flagged some pages. I want you to look at the rapists. This is what
their speech looks like. I want you to look at the women bound in

they say they own women. I want you to look and see the gags in their

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Pat Brown. All right.]{.font4}

[PAT BROWN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[I am a\] member of the National
Organization for Women's National Board from the Southwest Region. In
September, the National Board for the National Organization for Women
formed a subcommittee to look at the issue of pornography and the
proposed ordinances. After a great deal of study and a great deal of
debate the National Organization for Women decided at this point in time
to not support these ordinances.^6^ Now that is not because we do not
care about violence against women. It is not because we do not care
about the sexist images that are portrayed in pornography. It's simply
that we feel that this is perhaps not the best solution to the
problem.]{.font4}

[[6.  In 1984, National NOW passed the following resolution: "Resolved,
that NOW finds that pornography is a factor in creating and maintaining
sex as a basis for discrimination. Pornography, as distinct from
erotica, is a systematic practice of exploitation and subordination
based on sex which differentially harms women and children. This harm
includes dehumanization, sexual exploitation, forced sex, forced
prostitution, physical injury, and social and sexual terrorism and
inferiority presented as entertainment. Pornography violates the civil
rights of women and children. Be it further resolved that NOW supports
education and action by the chapters on this issue. "]{.sgc-12}\
]{.sgc-19}

[Some of the questions that we raised, and I raise them for you today,
are: what would such an ordinance do to sex education in this country?
What would it do to erotica? How do you define erotica, as opposed to
pornography? And I don't believe anyone has done that to this point in
time. What would it do to women's erotica? What would it do to lesbian
erotica?]{.font4}

[Having worked for many years as an ob-gyn nurse practitioner, I can
share with you that the young women in this country have very little sex
information and education, know very little about their bodies, have
very little sense of identity of themselves as persons apart from men,
who are still giving in to the lines that women of my generation, 35
years ago, gave in to then. If you love me, you will. Those kinds of
lines. I submit to you that it's far more important at this point in our
history, for us to support increased sex education for young people,
both young women and young men. That we help young people learn how to
parent, learn how to talk with one another so that they can share their
feelings and not take out their anger in violent ways, as men currently
do.]{.font4}

[Combating sexism in the media has been a long, enduring battle that
women still must fight. It is not just pornography that perpetuates
violence, it is comic books, it is television, it is film. I would
encourage you to look at another way of dealing with this problem. I
would encourage us to fight to enforce the laws that are on the books;
to encourage stiffer sentences for offenders, such as life in jail for
rapists, or death, or castration.]{.font4}

[I would encourage us to also look at ways of enacting hew laws, such as
putting a tax wherever violence is perpetuated, including in comic
books, and using the revenue from such tax to support programs that help
to retrain, reeducate and prepare women to enter a workforce where
they're hireable so that they do not have to make a living off of their
bodies unless they choose to do that knowingly. And that that revenue be
further used to increase the number of shelters that are so sorely
needed for battered women and to enact shelters for other women for whom
no shelters exist, such as battered lesbians. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CARL FABER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Dr. Carl Faber, in favor of the
ordinance.]{.font4}

[I am a clinical psychologist and teacher. I have been doing
psychotherapy in this community for almost 25 years. I have been
privileged to work with many, many dynamic and thoughtful women. An
almost universal problem is a problem of damage to the self in the women
I've known deeply. The self is silent, the self is broken, the self is
numb. The self in our work is something like the religious notion of the
soul, an inner form or sound or crystal structure that tells us what to
do, who to be, what direction to go in. We need it to know who we are.
The self is driven into seclusion and damaged by shame and humiliation.
When it happens we pull back, we cover up, and when it happens a lot, we
go deeply into ourselves.]{.font4}

[Well documented, and I've listened to it for years, is the damage done
by rape, emotional and sexual incest in families, battering, and almost
every woman's story of having had sexual intimacy hundreds of times when
they didn't want it, because they were afraid of a man's rage, or afraid
of losing him in a privileged male society. Less documented is the
damage done by the image-disrespectful attitude, inhuman attitude,
attitude toward woman as only a sexual object that is now poured out of
adult theaters and has become a face of mainstream movies. It's a part
of marketing everywhere you go in every department store.]{.font4}

[And it leaves women who are thoughtful and open in a desperate dilemma.
If they are open to the humiliation that they deal with daily, they feel
pain and impotent rage. The only way they get relief from that is by
fragmenting themselves, dying inside and giving up---despair versus
suicidal desperation.]{.font4}

[I believe that this community should be a respectful place to live in
for all of its members, and I urge you to support this legislation to
give women a safe place to live\....]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Welcome. This is Sally Fisk, and she represents
the Stonewall Democratic Club.]{.font4}

[SALLY FISK:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I find the climate I'm sitting in here
this morning one of the most frightening I have ever been subjected to.
I feel like we are attempting to resurrect witchburning. I feel like
there is an Oliver Cromwell in the shadows. I am appalled to find myself
defending the literature put on your desks. It is repulsive, it is
repugnant, and if it is repressed, I will see the poems of Auden and
Rich, the drawings of Kate Millett, and the works of many of my friends
suppressed.]{.font4}

[I would like to read you a statement. As southern California's largest
gay and lesbian political club, Stonewall has taken a clear and
outspoken stance over the past decade on women's issues. As an
individual, both politically and as a newsperson, I have worked to find
ways to quell the increasing wave of violence against women. I see no
solution to that problem in the proposed law. It is hard for me to
imagine many women affected by violence utilizing the law. Conversely,
it appears to me to be a clear threat to the civil liberties of writers,
publishers and book sellers. While it is an inventive attempt to
circumvent the First Amendment, it is a reprehensible one. It would
create a chilling climate for all of us who write, who publish, who sell
literature.]{.font4}

[Most particularly I perceive it as a threat to gay men and lesbians who
only recently have moved out of an oppression sufficiently to begin to
fill the body of literature and to have their own bookstores. Almost as
much as I abhor gratuitous violence and the objectifications of women, I
abhor laws which tamper against our freedoms assured us in the Bill of
Rights. Such laws do spiritual violence to us all. Every woman among us
would be better served by a continuing effort to examine and change the
texture of a society which fosters a rage against women and its
individuals.]{.font4}

[Stonewall Democratic Club as a body has voted its opposition to this
law and made a commitment to oppose its passage with all possible
efforts. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And speaking in favor of the ordinance, Dr.
Gail Stevenson..]{.font4}

[GAIL STEVENSON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm a licensed clinical psychologist,
and I've been in private practice in this community for approximately
ten years\....]{.font4}

[Mostly what I want to bring to your attention is the very negative
destructive effect of pornography on women. As Dr. Faber so eloquently
stated, pornography produces deep shame in the personality of women.
Historically, women have been able to deny this shame simply by
identifying with and acknowledging their inferiority in the culture. My
impression of the last six or seven years, as women no longer accept the
position of inferiority, is that they are also not able to defend
against the shame that is part of their personality\....]{.font4}

[From my clinical experience, I would say to you that there is no doubt
in my mind that women as well as men are deeply harmed by pornography,
and I think that this vehicle of the legislation that you are
considering provides a much needed vehicle for those who would try to
seek remedy against those who harm them with pornography, and I would
strongly urge you to pass this resolution, or this ordinance.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [And our last speaker against, opposing the
ordinance would be Carol Soble. Are you ready to speak now, Carol? You
would like to wait until all of the others have spoken? The others are
all\... well, I mean this is the last one for the opposing
viewpoint\.... \[inaudible audience comment\]. Pardon me, we have the
procedure set up that we will have a fa-\... \[inaudible audience
comment\]. But Sylvia Gentilly has spoken before, and Betty Brooks has
spoken before. You know our time is limited.]{.font4} 

[UNIDENTIFIED COMMISSIONER 2:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Madam Chair, I would like
to know who is running this hearing. I believe that we are running this
hearing for the public to give their testimony, and a tit-for-tat was
not what we had in mind. We are listening to testimony from the general
public, and I believe we have called on Miss Soble several times. In the
interest of time, I think we ought to get on with it, and not worry
about how many people are for or against, speaking. I resent having
someone from the audience try to run how this is going to be
heard.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Would you like to speak at this time?\...
\[inaudible audience comments\]. Dr. Brooks, if they had one person to
speak, and you had ten, would you feel comfortable if they had the last
word?\... You're out of order\....]{.font4}

[All right. Carol.]{.font4}

[CAROL SOBLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you. My name is Carol Soble. I'm
the associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern
California\....]{.font4}

[I'd like to echo the opinion that this Commission has from the County
Counsel as to the problems facing you. I find the preemption problem
insuperable. But setting it aside for the moment, I'd like to go to some
of the other issues that I think are problems.]{.font4}

[One, of course, is the issue of vagueness. The other is the issue of
overbreadth. I have heard people speaking for this ordinance in other
forums say that when people raise the specter of the repression of
women's literature, that that will not occur, because the EEOC, the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission generally, does not recognize
same sex oppression. But this is an enormous difference between the law
as it is presented here in Los Angeles and as it has been presented in
Indianapolis, where it is now before the courts. And that is the fact
that Los Angeles has nothing approximating a local Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. So there is nothing preventing people from doing
what's now happening in Long Beach, and what has happened in Oakland,
California where feminist books have been taken before the school boards
in communities throughout this country. To move to have books by women,
about women and for women brought into court by other women, who
disagree with those books, to move to have books around gay and lesbian
literature the subjects of litigation by other people who oppose gay and
lesbian literature---]{.font4}

[I think it's important in your debates to also recognize the impact of
the First Amendment. It is not an anomaly, as it has been presented. It
is a principle that is as relevant today as it is before in our
history.]{.font4}

[I think too, that there's been a confusion of terms. I have heard
people say that obscenity and pornography are not the same thing, and I
would agree with that, and that this is not obscenity they are talking
with, this is pornography. I would disagree with some of that, and I
think the confusion is best illustrated by the arguments that are being
made about pornography and obscenity, using the example of Linda
Marchiano. Linda Marchiano has been a victim of coercion in pornography;
I don't want to debate that, but clearly, it is without doubt, a fact
that the movie which she did, Deep Throat, has been one of the most
widely publicized obscenity convictions in recent times. ^7^ I think
there was a confusion of terms there. It is obscenity. Catharine
MacKinnon has said that obscenity does little harm. I would disagree
with that. Nevertheless, I think that we have to be careful not to deal
with those illusionary terms.]{.font4}

[[7. Some prosecutions of Deep Throat for obscenity resulted in
convictions. See, e. g., U. S. v. Battista, 646 F. 2d 237 (6th Cir.
1981); U. S. v. One Reel of Film, 481 F. 2d 206 (1st Cir. 1973). Most
did not. See, e. g., U. S. v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise,
Schedule No. 2102, 709 F. 2d 132, 13 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 816 (2nd Cir.
1983).]{.sgc-12}\
]{.sgc-19}

[Pornography will not go away. I think women already have an opportunity
to access the courts. But pornography will not go away, so what we
should really concern ourselves with is how we will change the attitudes
that foster inequality against women in this society, and I think that
is best done through education.]{.font4}

[No matter how many times we call pornography "conduct, " it remains
words and images. They are negative words and images. I don't disagree
with that. I don't like pornography, but nevertheless they are attitudes
deserving of First Amendment analysis. If they are not to have First
Amendment protection, then they lose that protection through First
Amendment analysis, and there is none of that applied here---no
stringent tests to prevent the First Amendment from being given a
blanket exception. Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Carol. Peter Bogdanovich, speaking
in favor of the ordinance.]{.font4}

[PETER BOGDANOVICH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In the name of freedom of speech, a
lot of people are being silenced in Los Angeles. In the name of sexual
freedom, a lot of people are being sexually enslaved and abused. Most of
them are women. Both those in pornography and those in legitimate
entertainment are included.]{.font4}

[Since Dorothy \[Stratten\] was killed, ^8^ a lot of women have written
to me or told me what]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [has done to them. It
exploits them---their bodies, their minds, and their dreams. Even if
they manage to avoid personal liaison within the sex factories, they
spend the rest of their lives trying to forget it, or live it down, or
cover it up, or get away from it. Other young women have been tricked,
pressured, blackmailed into pornography, and they have trouble, there's
trouble getting them out. Actresses who consented to some nudity in
legitimate films, pictures of this have been put into pornography
without their consent. Cybill Shepherd had that happen to her when, from
a picture we did together---and believe me, if I had that scene to do
over again, we'd just as soon not do it naked, because it wasn't really
necessary.]{.font4}

[ 8. See Peter Bogdanovich,]{.font3} [The Killing of the
Unicorn]{.font3} [(New York: William Morrow, 1984), which was submitted
to the Commission. Dorothy Stratten, who appeared in]{.font3}
[Playboy]{.font3}[, was murdered by her pimp husband.]{.font3}

[There are lucky ones who won lawsuits. They could afford lawsuits, but
didn't repair what happened to them. Since my last testimony, I've been
in touch with many people in the entertainment field about this
ordinance. They, along with the people that I'm mentioning, the silent
people, they're all afraid to come down here and tell you exactly about
their experiences, although they want the law, they think it would
improve their lives professionally as well as personally. Women who were
in pornography are afraid to speak out because it will call attention to
their past, which will destroy the margin of legitimacy that they have
been able to establish for themselves. These women live in fear of
exposure, and there are a lot of them.]{.font4}

[The pornographers and their supporters are so powerful, and the
connection between the pornography industry and the legitimate
entertainment industry is so intimate, that directors and producers and
writers and creative people of all kinds do not feel able to take a
stand against pornography because they're going to be blackmailed by
legitimate studios, distribution houses, etc. Some say, "Just wait till
I get this distributed, then I'll be free to go down and tell you what I
know, " or "I'm waiting to sell a TV show, and then I'll be able to come
out publicly for the ordinance. " The real story is that people are
intimidated out of speaking by those in power over their lives---in this
case, powerful corporations that control expression in this country, and
sexual so-called expression is, first of all, very big
business.]{.font4}

[When feminists say that pornography is not speech, it is silence, they
are speaking not only for all women, but for those in the entertainment
industry as well, the ones that are silenced out of coming down here to
tell you, this afternoon, that they want the pornographers stopped.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much. I am going to have to, we
simply do not have, time to listen to all of the others, who are all in
favor of the ordinance. We will have to do this at perhaps the next
meeting. I would like to allow 15 minutes for commissioners to ask
questions. If there is no objection.]{.font4}

[UNIDENTIFIED COMMISSIONER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I object strongly to
continuing this in the next meeting\....]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Well, I will call upon them\....]{.font4}

[PATRIC MAYERS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'd rather stand. Good morning. Thank
you for allowing me to speak. I'm speaking in favor, and I have several
reasons that have not been touched upon this morning. I am president of
one of Mayor Bradley's commissions, and through two years ago was a
senior consultant for State Senate President David Roberti. At that
time, while with Senator Roberti, we have throughout the state a
terrible, rampant prostitution problem, particularly in the Hollywood
area. And after considerable investigation, the entertaining of all
kinds of expertise, we felt that one way to go about this heinous
problem in the community was to go after the infrastructure of
prostitution, which is the pimps. And through my work Senator Roberti
authored, and was eventually passed in both houses, signed into law by
Governor Jerry Brown, a mandatory first time conviction, one year prison
sentence for pimping. And I would present to you and suggest that we
have a parallel situation here. Going after the worst elements in
publishing, proselytizing, the distributing is an apt way to
go.]{.font4}

[My interest in agreeing to Senator Roberti's instructions to make
something of this, and let's see what we can do about prostitution, has
to do with the fact that my wife, May Ann, married a man a year before I
was married to her some six years ago, was at gunpoint forced to commit
fellatio on a gentleman who eventually was sentenced to Atascadero. And
when the police came to his home in the Hollywood area, his bedroom
walls were just plastered with]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4} [extracts,
depicting women's breasts, he mutilated, sliced off, all kinds of
strange instruments in their vaginas and rectums and baseball bats and
pens and things like that. We had a very disturbed person here. And I
would suggest that this kind of material that fans the flames of very
disturbed minds, and with total respect to the First Amendment people
here, the few among the several in opposition, I would suggest that we
have a dreadful problem. And there are victims all the time, there are
victims like my wife, who seven years ago was terribly violated and
still sleeps badly as we approach this day.]{.font4}

[Thank you very much for your time, and also I would urge that this be
done with dispatch, that the quicker this is done, fine. And I don't see
that we have to hear the eventual constitutionality of this ordinance.
If Rosa Parks had feared the constitutionality of her sitting in the
back of the bus, she never would have gotten on that bus. Thank you very
much.]{.font4} 

[ELANA BOWMAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I am a member of the WAVAW ^9^
Coordinating Committee \[and\] the National Lawyer's Guild. I want to
tell you about three specific cases from my practice and from volunteer
work at the Domestic Violence Project of the Los Angeles Free
Clinic.]{.font4}

[Currently, one of my divorce clients is a battered woman and is
attempting to deny her husband the legal right to visit their children,
since she recently discovered that he had molested both of the children.
During their marriage, his pattern of abuse was to treat her especially
kindly for several weeks, taking her to dinner and paying her
compliments, then turning on her, picking a fight, and beating her. Then
he would resume months of indifference and coolness. During one period
of this very nice treatment she discovered hidden behind his bureau a
number of Spanish-language pornography magazines. One was of bondage and
whippings, and it was entitled,]{.font4} [Nasty Wife.]{.font4} [A few
days later she found a knife and a rope under their bed. She had never
seen a rope in their house before. The following day her husband began
calling her a nasty wife for the first time in their marriage, and
telling her that she needed to be punished for all the bad things she
did to him. That night she took her children and moved to a battered
women's shelter and started a divorce proceeding.]{.font4}

[In a second case, a psychiatrist brought one of his patients, a woman
in her sixties, to his home for several therapy sessions. During one of
these sessions, he showed her a series of pornography slides telling her
she was sexually inhibited, and this treatment was beneficial. He then
raped her, and held her in his home for the entire night, and raped her
throughout the night while pornographic slides were automatically shown
in the same room. He released her in the morning, saying the experience
was part of her treatment.]{.font4}

[In the third case, I was working up the papers for a restraining order
at the Domestic Violence Project, when a woman began telling me that her
husband confessed to her that he had raped his daughter from his first
marriage, and that he served time for it. She asked him how he could do
that to his own blood. He answered that it was all right, that the
little girl hadn't minded it, and that he had enjoyed it enough for both
of them. He had seen the pictures of it, and when girls did it enough,
they liked it, and that they really did like it or they wouldn't do it
in the pictures he had seen. We talked more about that, and I asked her
if she thought that the porn he read was any cause of what he had done.
She said, "Of course, " and he had those magazines now, and she had had
enough. She had a little girl too, and she was doing all she could to
stop him from getting to her daughter.]{.font4}

[This debate has been focused, as with all progressive legislation, on
the damage done to the rights of the oppressors. In 1964, the focus was
on the rights of racist motel owners to refuse public accommodations to
blacks. In the '70s, the focus was on the employer's free speech right
to sexually insult women at the workplace. Now, the focus is on the
rights of the makers and distributors of porn, not on the rights of
the-women who are its deliberate victims. Thank you\....]{.font4}

[DANI ADAMS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm the director of Women Against Violence
Against Women in Los Angeles. WAVAW is a feminist educational
organization \[that\] does not have occasion to deal directly with women
who are survivors of violence. However, those of us on the coordinating
committee are activists who are also involved in other areas of the
women's movement: self-defense classes for women, rape crisis services,
battered women's shelters. We hear women's stories, and we have read
feminist essays written by women who have talked with more
women.]{.font4}

[ 9. Women Against Violence Against Women.]{.font3}

[We have also read all of the scientific studies that I'm sure you're
all familiar with. So we know that women are being raped, beaten and
murdered at rates that are epidemic. Nearly 50 percent of us will be
raped, over 60 percent of married women are physically abused by their
husbands, and 25 percent of our children are sexually abused before the
age of eighteen. We know that men read more pornographic literature than
news magazines. We know that boys get their early sex education
reading]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}[,]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4} [and
other pornography, all of which shows women willingly submitting to
everything from pseudo-rape situations made to look romantic to being
tied or chained, to being whipped and cut and mutilated. We also know
from studies that men who viewed sex-violent material tended to be more
stimulated by the idea of rape and less sympathetic to the victim. And
we have learned that anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of men in those
studies admitted that they would rape if they could get away with it. We
also know that people of all ages learn by reading books and looking at
pictures. Otherwise, why do we have schools?]{.font4}

[As feminists, we know that attacks on women take many forms. Job
discrimination, sexual harassment on the job, harassment on the street,
battering, rape, torture and murder. WAVAW knows as well the continuum
from objectification of women to violence against women that the print
and film media bombard us with continually. And we know that what we do
in our lives affects what we see in these media. And beyond any doubt,
what the media shows us affects what we do.]{.font4}

[Those who oppose this ordinance, when pressed, usually admit they are
against any such law, and it seems they are willing to do and say
anything to stop this ordinance. Most of their arguments have been used
before, in opposition to civil rights laws and consumer protection laws,
to name just two. And some of their arguments are just plain insulting
and off the subject. We feminists in favor of an ordinance are not
talking about erotica or educational photos, or sex, or prostitution, or
homosexuality, and we're certainly not talking about obscenity. Most of
us are not sexually repressed, and we are aware of the possibility, as
they say, that someone may try to use this ordinance against it, but I'm
sure unsuccessfully\.... I think this ordinance as it's written will
confine itself to harmful material, and if there's anything in this
ordinance that's illegal or unconstitutional, the courts will find it.
That's not our job.]{.font4}

[We've been told by some feminists that we should talk about this issue
some more, and that we should be doing public education. They also say
that this won't stop violence against women. Women have been talking and
educating for years. It's time for something more. We know we can't stop
all violence in one step, but it's defeatist to do nothing. This
ordinance will give a woman who is harmed the individual power to sue
for damages, no more and no less\.... That's what we want to see. We
must take the first step to break the circle of violence. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[CATHARINE MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to respond very
briefly to a couple of the legal points that have been raised and to say
something about the design of this ordinance in general.]{.font4}

[We have heard numbers of attacks on this law this morning that are very
wrong on the way it would work, and on who would be able to bring
claims, and on what kinds of materials the law would most likely apply
to. Most broadly, we have heard attacks on this proposed ordinance that
are essentially based on the evils of existing law, some of the ways
existing laws have been abused. Those laws are prone to that kind of
abuse. And at the same time, the same people have suggested that we
should enforce existing laws, which is a little ironic.]{.font4}

[Most broadly, I have heard support for pornography in a way that
suggests to me, putting it together with what the psychologists have
mentioned, that very often people who are abused by a system respond by
identifying with the abuser and by defending the source of the abuse.
Women fear that any time we try to change the situation in which we are
abused, it may be made worse. What we're attempting to do here is to
change the existing situation so that there will be any chance that it
will ever be better. And that's true both legally and on the level of
direct action against violence.]{.font4}

[I'd like to talk for a minute about how narrow the law is that we have
proposed, particularly in light of the kinds of abuses that women have
mentioned this morning.]{.font4}

[Under our definition, it is entirely unlikely that the definition of
pornography would apply to what is called mere nudity. It is also very
unlikely that it would apply---it would not be legal if it were to
apply---to all sexually explicit materials, whether or not women are
subordinated in their making, distribution or use. That it doesn't apply
either to the violence-only materials, it doesn't apply to ads, most
media, or a great deal of violence in mass media.]{.font4}

[In addition to that, we have the force provision, which would not apply
directly to materials that are simply on the newsstands, that somebody
simply comes on to, or that are on someone's wall. Under our assault
provision, it is sufficiently narrow that it wouldn't apply to all the
situations in which women don't know where the assault came from, aren't
able to track it down to specific pornography.]{.font4}

[The coercion provision, that is for women who are coerced into
pornography, would not apply to things like simple pressure, and
frankly, it would not apply to those circumstances in which women are
coerced by poverty, by economic desperation. It would set a base for
their working conditions, even those it does not apply to---as I'm sure
you know, it does not apply to live sex.]{.font4}

[So what we have, then, is the trafficking provision, which would permit
women to address the evils of pornography that you have heard about this
morning \[that cannot be addressed\] through those direct provisions.
The trafficking provision however---it, itself---doesn't apply to
possession. It doesn't apply to consumption. It applies to the people
who push it. It applies to the pornographers: the makers, exhibiters,
sellers, and distributors.]{.font4}

[You've heard a lot of abuses today. Some of them would be actionable
under this law, but those that would not be, are the ones that both
point out how in fact narrow this law is, and how it could not be abused
in the ways people have suggested to you that it could. But also that,
through the trafficking provision---even though it does not address
consumption, does not address possession, and in that sense does not go
to free choice---it would address problems, including abuses that\...
are not actionable under \[existing\] law. Thank you.]{.font4}

[B. J. CLING:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is B. J. Cling. I am a clinical
psychologist in private practice in Los Angeles. I recently had a throat
operation, and I'm having a problem here for a moment. I'm also about to
graduate from UCLA Law School, and I have done a post-doctoral
fellowship at USC in the Department of Psychiatry and Law. Following
that I was on the clinical faculty there for two years. In my part of
practice, and more specifically, in my work at USC I worked with sex
offenders, mostly child molesters and flashers, and I also evaluated a
number of rapists. I feel that what should be considered here is
balancing the First Amendment against what I think is a very greatly
underestimated harm to women.]{.font4}

[I would like to say that, as a psychologist, I was frankly unaware of
the enormous part that pornography is playing and has played in the
minds of the sex offenders who I evaluated. And this is because, at
least for me, it was only when I went to UCLA and took a course in which
this problem was addressed, that I began to think back to the use of
pornography with these men who I had evaluated, because as a
psychologist this was never discussed. We didn't even look for it. So it
was only when it was told to us incidentally that we discovered it, and
it wasn't until I recently started thinking back that I realized there
was a lot of it, and that it's grossly underestimated.]{.font4}

[For example, one of the many child molesters who I evaluated told me
that his modus operandi was to have young girls, six and seven years
old, he would befriend them. He was a man who was about forty. He would
befriend them, and he would have them come over to his house and he
would pay them to clean his house, you know, a quarter, a dollar. And he
would casually put around pornography on the living room table, and then
he would open it up for them, and then he would try to get them to pose
for it, like they were in the movies. This I did not really piece
together until recently as the use of pornography. It's a very clear
use.]{.font4}

[Another example, actually this comes from my private practice. There
are several patients of mine who habitually use pornography and have
severe sexual problems. One is, as a matter of fact, a homosexual who
uses constant violent pornography to excite himself, and it is
impossible for him to now make love with his lover, who he loves. It's
only possible for him to have violent sex with people he doesn't
know.]{.font4}

[Another man who uses pornography at least twice daily, who's a fine
upstanding citizen, finds it impossible to relate to women in any normal
way. And it is my belief now that this has to do with the constant
recurring of these sexual images in pornography that has taught him what
sexuality is all about, which he finds impossible to have with a normal
woman. And that is probably because he's not willing at this point, I
hope, to force someone to do those things with him, and no one has
voluntarily been willing to do those things.]{.font4}

[Anyway, I guess I would just say in summary, that I feel that
psychologists, and I plan to help educate them, \[must\] become aware of
the part that pornography is playing in a sex offense. You will hear
much more testimony as to its harm. It's just that, as psychologists, we
have been in ignorance of this. Thank you.]{.font4}

[SARAH SCHULTZ:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Sarah Schultz, and I'm a
psychiatric nurse, and the only organization I've been involved in
lately is Students Against Violence at Cal. State, Northridge. I work in
a hospital where I had an instance happen that really made the whole
issue of what I was supporting at school come into my life.]{.font4}

[I overheard half of a phone conversation with one of the young
housekeepers, and she was telling her friend, "I know it's pornography,
is what they're trying to do. " And it was like I didn't want to be in
tune to what was going on, so I tried to turn off the conversation, and
afterwards I asked her if she was all right. And she proceeded to tell
me her friend, who's on welfare, has three children, saw an ad in the
newspaper. It said "Girls, Girls, Girls. " And she brought it in and
showed it to me, and it's very typical in all the newspapers: Modeling,
\$300 a day. And she felt she could get money for her children for
Christmas for presents. She didn't have money. And so this young lady
that I know was trying to talk her out of it, and it went on. I would
see her every once in a while. I don't see this particular person on a
daily basis. It's more like every three weeks or so. And each time she
began telling me the persuasion that was going on, and I could
understand how easily a young woman could slip into this.]{.font4}

[She began by going for the interview, and they made pictures of her,
and paid her the money and told her they were going to make her a star.
And it seemed all---everything seemed all right. So she proceeded to
leave, and they said, by the way, we may have some lingerie ads you
could do for us. We need you, just take your clothes off. I want to see
if there's any marks on your body. She did that, put her clothes on and
left. And all along this young woman that I know is trying to talk her
out of it.]{.font4}

[Well, it got to the point where they started at one location. Then they
began to tell her she could become a star on cable television. They took
her to another location that---all I know is Melrose near La Cienega,
looks like a library, and this young lady I know was taken along one
evening, hoping to recruit her. But she didn't get involved in it. She
described it as looking like a library. It was run by an Asian man, a
black man, and a white man, and an Indian man. And it was very
sophisticated as far as \[being\] computerized and how the doors are
very secure. Each room had names on 'em. It was sadomasochistic things
that were going on.]{.font4}

[She came home and when the woman I know did not get involved, the young
woman who was involved in all of this was given "punishment" for not
having the friend come along. She was then, began to be threatened. The
young woman came home with welts on her arms and the young woman I know
kept saying, "they're beating you. " And she's saying, "No, no, it's all
right. It's all right. " She pulled her shirt up quickly and saw there's
welts all over her back. There's track marks on her arm, and then she
confessed to her that she was told there would be harm to her children
if she didn't cooperate. And it's to the point of
immobilization.]{.font4}

[This young lady, I consoled her as much as I could. I talked with a
police psychologist that I work with, and she said that the police
wouldn't get involved because it is pornography. I felt totally
helpless. I contacted Women Against Violence Against Women, and got the
phone number, gave it to this young woman, and they've been supportive
of her.]{.font4}

[OK. And I just feel like this ordinance is so important because this is
going on every day, especially here in Los Angeles. Real important.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[CHAIR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much. And we have one more
person, attorney Gloria Allred.]{.font4}

[GLORIA ALLRED:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Morning. I'm just going to take a few
seconds rather than the three minutes, because I just was here this
morning to give testimony, but I have been so impressed by the personal
testimony of those people who came to speak in support of the ordinance,
to speak in support of it from their own personal experiences---either
they have had as victims of pornography, or as part of the family, or as
a psychoanalyst or members of the psychological community who have
treated such victims---that I think I would like to see their testimony
in support of the ordinance given the most weight. And I just leave you
with what Golda Meier said quoting Hillel, "If I am not for myself, who
will be? If I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?

[REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA HILDT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman and the Committee, thank you for hearing testimony on House
Bill 5194, "An Act to Protect the Civil Rights of Women and Children.
"]{.font4}

[I wish to begin my testimony with a statement of facts. Fact: Every
twenty-two days a Massachusetts woman is murdered by her husband or male
partner. Fact: In 1989, violence against women forced more than 21, 000
women to seek shelter from batterers in Massachusetts. These women were
caretakers of approximately 32, 000 children at risk. Fact: The
Massachusetts Department of Social Services substantiated that 22, 532
women were physically or sexually abused last year, a 19% increase over
the year before, an epidemic of violence that threatens our families,
our schools, and our communities. Fact: Abused children are seven times
more likely to commit suicide and twice as likely to abuse alcohol or
drugs. Fact: Pornography is a \$10 billion a year industry and it is
growing. Fact: Pornography in the past two decades has increasingly
depicted images of violence against women and children and deemphasized
its sexual content. Fact: Each and every time a child is depicted in a
pornographic image, that child is being sexually exploited and
abused.]{.font4}

[I appear before the Committee today to testify in favor of House Bill
5194, "An Act to Protect the Civil Rights of Women and Children. " This
legislation, as its title suggests, will permit individuals who can
prove that they have been injured by pornography to seek civil damages
through the courts. Opponents of this bill will claim that the First
Amendment protects their right to portray women, men and children in any
manner they see fit, regardless of how they damage the lives of others.
But no one has the right to scream "fire" in a crowded theater, because
of the injury they may cause. And the pornographer should
not ]{.font4}[profit from human suffering and hide behind a veil of
constitutional protection. Each of us is ultimately responsible for the
injury we cause.]{.sgc-3}

[This bill defines pornography as the graphic sexually explicit
subordination of women, men and children. Under this new law, it shall
be considered sex discrimination to coerce, intimidate or fraudulently
induce any person into performing in pornography. It shall be sex
discrimination to force pornography on a person in any place of
employment, education, home or public place. It shall be sex
discrimination to assault, physically attack or injure any person in a
way that is directly caused by specific pornography. It shall be sex
discrimination to defame any person through the unauthorized use of
pornography of their proper name, image or recognizable personal
likeness. It shall be sex discrimination to produce, sell, exhibit or
distribute pornography in such a way that it causes harm to another
person. Libraries and academic institutions in which pornography is
available for study are exempted from the provisions of this
bill.]{.font4}

[Let me emphasize that this proposed law will allow individuals,
primarily women and children, to sue for damages if they can prove that
their civil rights have been violated by the production, use or display
of pornographic materials. This is not a bill about censorship. It is a
civil rights bill---which is a critical distinction for this
Committee.]{.font4}

[The Committee will hear testimony today from a variety of people who
came forward, sometimes at personal risk, to describe their personal
experience with pornography or have studied this issue and have
concluded that new law is needed to contend with some of the damaging
consequences. The damage done to the lives of women and children is
significant. It is long-lasting, and we can do something to restore the
rights of those who have been so damaged. I urge the Committee to listen
to this testimony carefully and to evaluate the merits of arguments in
favor of this law and to issue a favorable recommendation on House Bill
5194.]{.font4}

[REPRESENTATIVE SHIRLEY OWENS-HICKS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mr.
Chairman, for taking me out of turn. I'm here to be recorded in favor of
House 5194\....]{.font4}

[REPRESENTATIVE MARY JEANETTE MURRAY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I do want to be
recorded in favor of House 5194, a bill that I think is long overdue,
and we ought to do something about it\.... You're going to hear a lot of
testimony on this issue today, and I hope that you will take a good look
at this issue and give us a favorable on it. Thank you very
much.]{.font4}

[REPRESENTATIVE MARC DRAISEN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman, for allowing me to speak out of turn. I will be brief. I guess
I'll just start out by saying that I'm here to speak in favor of House
5194.]{.font4}

[I became involved in the matter of 5194 when my constituent Professor
Gail Dines asked me to attend a screening of a slide show\.... In the
course of that profoundly disturbing slide show, I guess I became aware
how either naive or sheltered my own existence had been prior to that
time\.... I would urge all members of the Committee, no matter how
difficult it may be, to some time, in the course of deliberating on this
bill, take a look at either all or a portion of the images of violence
against women which have become routine---not only in pornographic
literature, but, to a lesser degree, even in some of the more legitimate
media within \[this\] state and in our country.]{.font4}

[It seemed to me then, and at the time after that when I decided to
cosponsor this bill, that no interpretation of the First Amendment, as I
understand it, could possibly have been intended by the founders of the
country to legitimize or make routinely available images which not only
so clearly are exploitative and demeaning of women in our society, but
whose obvious impact must be to encourage, to reward, or to sanction the
behavior of such violence. It seems to me therefore that we must find
some way legislatively to address this problem and to eliminate, to the
best of our ability, the trade in such images.]{.font4}

[Now, having said that, I would state that there are serious and
legitimate concerns about this bill that will be aired by many very
intelligent and capable people on both sides of the issue before you
today. Rep. Hildt and I have had, with a number of people on both sides
of this issue, I think a very good exchange several weeks ago, raising
very critical questions, reasonable questions, about the definition of
pornography from a sexual perspective versus a violent perspective,
about whether or not it is most appropriate to approach this issue by
eliminating production or eliminating distribution, by whether you want
to have sanctions before the fact or after the fact, about whether or
not this is best dealt with from a discrimination perspective or a
criminal perspective---all of which are legitimate questions. I would
urge you, Mr. Chairman, to use your leadership to try and bring forward
a resolution and consideration of these questions. Any piece of
legislation can be perfected and improved.]{.font4}

[However, the central point which I would like to drive home today is
that this is so serious an issue, an issue which cuts across simply
liberal or conservative lines, that it is in my opinion incumbent upon
this legislature to deal with it in some way. And I am confident that a
way can be found which is reasonable, from the perspective of our
constitutional restraints, as well as which will enable us to eliminate
images which certainly encourage the violent treatment and the demeaning
of women in our society. I think that House 5194 in its current draft
points us along the direction of one possible road toward that
objective.]{.font4}

[And I would urge therefore the Judiciary Committee to consider it
seriously, to take into account possibly amendments which might perfect
it in its effort to withstand court challenges, and to report it
favorably to the floor of the House. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[WILLIAM HUDNUT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman,
members of the Committee, my name is Bill Hudnut. I was mayor of
Indianapolis for sixteen years, two years a congressman before that, and
am now a fellow at the Institute of Politics at the JFK School of
Government and a resident of Massachusetts, along with members of my
family who are buried out in Holyoke.]{.font4}

[I was the mayor of Indianapolis and encouraged an ordinance similar to
this to be passed by our City Council in 1984---which it was, by a vote
of 25 to 4. Two hours after I signed the bill, there was a lawsuit filed
against it and it was immediately thrown into the courts, and
subsequently, in later 1984, the ordinance was declared
unconstitutional. The reason given by the federal judge was that the
language was too broad and vague. We appealed it, ultimately all the way
up to the Supreme Court, where the original ruling was upheld.^1^ Having
some eight years having transpired since then, I am welcoming the
opportunity to come to you to say that I don't regret what we did in
Indianapolis, and I wish those who are supporting 5194 all success in
their efforts here in Massachusetts.]{.font4}

[1. The U. S. Supreme Court summarily affirmed American Booksellers
Ass'n Inc. v. Hudnut, 475 U. S. 1001 (1986). The entire appellate
opinion, with a brief introductory comment, is reproduced in the
Appendix to this book on pp. 465-482.]{.font3}

[I think that the United States of America is a society which values
free speech very much, but not when it goes so far as to dehumanize or
demean or degrade other human beings. There are limits that the
Constitution and the Supreme Court have placed on free speech. It has
already been mentioned. You cannot cry "fire" in a crowded building,
because of the harm that may result from doing that, in terms of people
getting stampeded at the door. Well, harm can be caused by words and
pictures that are pornographic and that in some way graphically and
sexually depict, through the materials, subordination of women.]{.font4}

[What we're trying to do here, it seems to me, is to connect the fight
for civil rights for women to the fight against the blighting influences
of pornography in a community, blighting influences that will deny women
equal opportunity, which is a civil rights issue. We're not talking
here, it seems to me, about an issue that has to do with freedom of
speech, so much as we are talking here about an issue that has to do
with protection of our community and of women against the poisonous
influence of pornography that leads to vicious acts against them in many
instances--- and you will be hearing some testimony about that.]{.font4}

[So, in sum, I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I hope the
experience in Indianapolis is instructive. I know that the attorneys who
argued the case against our city are in the room, and they won and I
lost. But I think this is a battle worth fighting and worth coming
around again on, and I would hope that in the enlightened wisdom of you
and your colleagues in the Massachusetts legislature would pass this
legislation. Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[WALSH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible\]]{.font4}

[HUDNUT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Before I signed it, I said, "We're not going
to put this into effect until we see how this court case is disposed of,
" because I knew the lawsuit was coming, so it never went into effect,
because two hours after I signed it, the lawsuit was filed and it was in
the courts, and ultimately the declaration of unconstitutionality was
found. So what has happened here is, we're trying to tighten the
language, refine the language, define things better, and make it more
restrictive so that it can come within the framework of the First
Amendment, which we all honor.]{.font4}

[There are two or three things that are different. The main thing that's
different is in the trafficking provisions. It is limited to that which
is depicted---not to words, just to visuals. The second difference is
that the Indianapolis ordinance required people to go with their
complaint to our Equal Employment Office and then, if that office wanted
to take it to a court, they could. Here, they are given the right to
take it directly to court. The third difference is that this is a bill
that does not restrict the definition just to violence like Indianapolis
did.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are there any attorneys on your side \[who are
familiar with the law\]?]{.font4}

[HUDNUT:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think there are some attorneys who are very
familiar with it on my side. I'm sorry, I'm just a dumb preacher who
fell from grace and went into politics. \[Laughter. \] Catharine
MacKinnon is here and there are others.]{.font4}

[This is a situation where reasonable, sincere people of good character
and conscience will differ. And I know you have to sort it out, and it's
not a black and white issue. There are indeterminate grays here. I think
what we have to do is find out where the preponderance of right lies and
then move in that direction, according to the dictates of our
conscience. That's what we tried to do in Indianapolis. And our sincere
opinion---even though it was opposed by much of the media in
Indianapolis and even though, editorially, I took a lot of hits for
it---it seems to me that somehow the framers of the Constitution did not
intend free speech to make it possible for women to be demeaned and
degraded and dehumanized in the United States of America.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Let's call from the opposing side. Michael
Bamberger.]{.font4}

[MICHAEL BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman. My
name is Michael Bamberger. I'm here as general counsel for the Media
Coalition, which is a group of some eight trade associations involved in
mainstream publishing, bookselling, video, software, the recording
industry, etc. But I'm here even more so as the counsel in the two prior
successful challenges of the bill you have before you. Let me very
briefly give you a history of the bill and suggest to you why it is
futile to put it again to the courts.]{.font4}

[Let me say that, to start off with, that the members of the Media
Coalition are as concerned about the civil rights of the citizens of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and desire to eliminate gender-based
discrimination whenever and wherever it occurs. But that does not mean I
suggest that this group should support an unconstitutional
bill.]{.font4}

[The bill was originally drafted by Professor MacKinnon together with
others in Minneapolis in 1983. In late 1983, it was passed by the
Minneapolis City Council and it was vetoed by Mayor Fraser early in
1984, on the ground that while the aims may be laudable, the means were
patently unconstitutional. Later that year, the bill, as Mayor Hudnut
suggested---slightly modified---was passed by the City-County Council of
Indianapolis, Indiana. A lawsuit was promptly brought and each of the
courts before whom the lawsuit was heard found it unconstitutional. It
was found unconstitutional by the district court, it was affirmed by the
Court of Appeals and---I beg to differ with Mayor Hudnut---it was
affirmed by the U. S. Supreme Court in what is called a summary
affirmance, and thus ended that ordinance.]{.font4}

[Two years later, no, a little more than that, in 1988, the bill in
substance once again appeared as a citizens' initiative in the city of
Belling ham, Washington. It was passed. We \[brought\] a lawsuit there.
The claim was made similar to the position that Mayor Hudnut was making
here--- the claim was made by many, including Professor MacKinnon at
that time, that times were different, the bill was slightly different,
the Supreme Court decision wasn't binding. That was all knocked down by
the federal district judge there. Judge Dimmick held it
unconstitutional, granted summary judgment, and that bill dies.]{.font4}

[Thus, the only challenges have been these four challenges and it has
been uniformly held unconstitutional. And I should mention,
incidentally, that in both the]{.font4} [Hudnut]{.font4} [case and in
the]{.font4} [Bellingham]{.font4} [case, plaintiffs' counsel were
granted substantial attorneys fees against the cities involved for
having to challenge a statute that was unconstitutional.]{.font4}

[I urge this group that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has better
ways to spend its time and money than rehashing an unconstitutional
bill, and that I urge it, seek some other way, if these harms \[are\]
not already redressed or redressable under the laws of the Commonwealth.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I believe you've all gotten copies of this
and what I did is, I attached the various legal opinions. I don't
suggest you read them now. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the
federal Court of Appeals, held that the core definition of
pornography---which is virtually identical in that ordinance with the
one in the bill that you have before you---violated the First Amendment
because it went beyond that which could be regulated by the state,
basically on the ground that because a view is reprehensible does not
permit one to ban it. Therefore Judge Easterbrook said that since the
central definition fell, the entire statute, which relied on the
definition, fell as well. In the lower court, the trial judge also found
that the statute was unconstitutionally vague in many respects and
spells it out there as well, and basically that it covers and would
restrict the sale and permit the injunction of the sale of mainstream
material which is protected by the First Amendment.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is there anything different about this
particular bill, or is it substantially the same as the one you argued
\[inaudible\]?]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It is substantially the same. I did not
argue it before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed on papers.
The definition of pornography is the same. As mentioned by Mayor Hudnut,
there is one difference here, with respect to one of the infractions,
that apparently they limit the regulation to pictorial material rather
than written material, and as Professor MacKinnon was quoted in
the]{.font4} [Times]{.font4} [yesterday, that may make it]{.font4}
[politically]{.font4} [more palatable, but it doesn't change the
constitutional issue.]{.font4}

[\[Question concerning the coercion clause is inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My understanding, for example, is that as
part of the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, there is a provision
which prevents the taking away of one's civil rights by means of
coercion. I'm told there is already one in the law. I do not know how it
is applied. I have not examined it.]{.font4}

[The bill has many parts. One is the coercion issue, which you have
raised. Another one is what Mayor Hudnut referred to as the trafficking
provision, which in effect permits any woman suing on behalf of women
generally to go in and say, "this material harms women, " and to try and
get it banned throughout the whole state. That there is no present
provision for, nor do I believe that can constitutionally be.]{.font4}

[\[Question on community standards and privacy is inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Certainly the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
could give rights to persons whose rights of privacy have been invaded.
New York, where I am from, has a rather broad provision that includes
not only using a picture without authority but also misusing it---taking
it for one purpose and using for another. That has been held
constitutional in New York and I presume similar laws, if they are not
already in place here, could be put in place here.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I believe that the bill is unconstitutional
for many reasons. I believe the two core reasons are the vagueness in
trying to determine what is covered and the apparent breadth of the
coverage.]{.font4}

[\[Question on whether coercion is already covered under Massachusetts
laws\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I can't speak about the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Many states have laws that say, for
example, if you are coerced or duped into a sexual act that's a form of
assault to which you have not consented. Therefore, you have a remedy in
court and you may well have a remedy on the criminal side as
well.]{.font4}

[\[Question about pornography and its relationship to discrimination
against women in physical injury, or discrimination in employment and
opportunity\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [To the extent that I can discern it, the
premise of the legislation is that a multitude of harms which have been
suffered by women relate to published materials that depict women in a
subordinate role, and then from that there follows a whole series of
remedies.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is it that you disagree that that doesn't
happen, or do you disagree that it can be defined, what type of
information gives rise to that particular kind of subordination---is
that what you're saying?]{.font4} [BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm in no
position to agree or disagree whether in a general sense all these ills
can be traced to this source. I'm just a poor lawyer.
\[Inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I believe that most states have laws that
could today be read as Judge Easterbrook set forth. The coercion
provision in this bill goes further and says that the fact that the
person signed a contract, the fact that the person knew what she was
doing, or the fact that the person consented does not prove lack of
coercion. One has a problem with that, because if you eliminate all the
possible elements you can use to prove consent, it's very hard to deny
coercion.]{.font4}

[\[Walsh question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think one of the problems---and that's
not speaking as a lawyer but speaking from yourself---one of the
problems in terms of analyzing this bill, and grappling with it, that
the phrase "sex discrimination" sweeps in a range of harms going from
rape at one extreme to humiliation to the having at large materials that
one is uncomfortable with, and can I think of a word that can wrap it
all up and solve the constitutional problem? No. I think you really have
to separate the different concerns and the different rights granted and
then see which of these rights are not presently appropriately handled
and which can be handled in constitutional \[inaudible\].]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Part of them have already been achieved. I
presume that the obscenity laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
prohibit the sale, distribution, etc. of material that is obscene on the
one hand, and probably material that is harmful to minors in terms of
minors on the other hand, so that what might be called the trafficking
part of the bill here is presently covered fully and it's a question and
I'm sure it's well enforced.]{.font4}

[With respect to the rights of victims to sue, those who are harmed as a
result of someone dealing with obscenity, there are several difficult
questions. Number one is the causation question: how can one prove or
know that someone did this because of that. There is the continuing
danger that you don't want to divert your efforts towards hitting
businesspeople because of a harm rather than trying to go criminally
after the criminal actor who in fact himself did the harm. But leaving
that aside, there have been arguments made at the local level once with
certain types of issues, possibly violent obscenity, that if one could
prove causation, that there might be a claim there. There are enormous
problems with it: constitutional problems, problems of causation,
problems of suing the deep pocket and not worrying about stopping the
rapist, and so on. So, there are really problems everywhere you
go.]{.font4}

[I, unfortunately, cannot say, "I have a wonderful solution. " One of
the attractive things about this bill is it says, "If you get rid of
this, a whole major problem of our society may be alleviated. " I wish I
could say \[that\], but unfortunately I can't.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[BAMBERGER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [A statute of limitations---you have rights
of the plaintiff and rights of the defendant, and you have to try to
balance the two. One of the suggestions that has been made, and I'm not
really in a position to speak to it because I haven't looked at it
carefully, is to provide some appropriate tolling time during which
there is no knowledge of the ability to bring the lawsuit. If this young
woman did not know that her image had been retained and put in a video
and appears some years later, possibly by a tolling device rather than a
broad extension of the statute of limitations may be the way to go. But
that is not an area that I have really examined closely.]{.font4}

[PAT HAAS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Pat Haas. I live in Brookline. I
experienced from 1987 to 1989 in a two-year relationship with my
batterer---from the very beginning, I was forced to provide videos for
him. He found one particular one very appealing. It was of
sadomasochism. He spent hours watching this movie and he then started
forcing me to do the things that were in this movie. One night, I spent
an evening with him. I had hot wax dripped on me. A couple of weeks
later, I was forced to pierce my nipples, I was forced to have sex with
other people, it didn't make any difference---men, women, groups. He had
me playing watersports games, which is drinking urine. And every time I
said no, he would find a way of beating me. Most of the time it was with
a two-inch belt. He had knives at my throat; he tried strangling me on
occasion. I'd been threatened with a .38. He put a gun at my son's head.
At the end of the relationship, one of the things he wanted most was my
death, either at his hands or at mine, and I was forced to take an
overdose. I was clinically dead for between two and four minutes. I
spent 21 days in the hospital. And at this point, two and a half years
later, I am still trying to pick up the pieces.]{.font4}

[It has been a long, hard road, and this law needs to be passed to stop
this kind of man. He did what was in these movies. There are videos of
me out there somewhere. There are Polaroids that supposedly were
destroyed. I don't know. I was told by the police that if these things
come to surface, I can face criminal prosecution for things I had no
control over. And he needs to be stopped, and the people who make these
kind of movies need to be stopped.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Was he arrested or charged for---]{.font4}

[HAAS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [He now will be charged. After two and a half
years I now have a criminal complaint. I go to a support group for
battered women. I have been in therapy for three years. I have a network
of friends and family that haven't abandoned me. It has been a long road
up.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is this man in custody right now?]{.font4}

[HAAS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No. He's at large, and I don't know if that hold
that he had over me is still there. I have not faced that man in a long
time. If he said to me, "come back, " I would be dead within a matter of
weeks. Because that's what he wants from me\.... He took things straight
out of the movies and used them on me. If he had seen a snuff film, I
wouldn't be here at this moment. What he has done to me, he has
attempted on his own children.]{.font4}

[PEGGY CHARREN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I appreciate the opportunity to come
talk in opposition to 5194. I'm president of Action for Children's
Television which is a child advocacy group, national with members across
the country and the support of maybe 50 major national organizations
from the American Academy of Pediatrics to the National P. T. A. that
have stood with ACT for more than two decades, as we said that
censorship was not the way to deal with the problem of children's
television and children's media. That you can turn off what's terrible,
you can't turn on what's missing, so ACT has devoted its advocacy time
to trying to create a market for what was missing.]{.font4}

[We recently won a case when we took the FCC to court for its attempt to
ban indecency 24 hours a day. We won at the Court of Appeals and we won
recently when the FCC appealed it to the Supreme Court and the Supreme
Court refused to hear it.]{.font4}

[We are opposed to what we think is a misguided effort, although
certainly anyone would sympathize with the previous testimony and with
women who are abused and with children who are abused in this country.
But we're opposed to this effort to increase the banning of speech by
redefining pornography as a way of dealing with these problems. We think
that censorship is a slippery slide and that what is obnoxious, what's
perceived to be terrible speech to one person, may be somebody else's
essential education.]{.font4}

[I know that isn't in the minds of the people who designed the proposed
legislation, but the problem is that censorship statutes can be used by
people who have much narrower ideas about what is appropriate to ban.
They want to ban, say, an hour show that could be perceived to be
pornographic when really it's education about AIDS. And that's the
problem with censorship generally. Legislation includes speech that I
find important to have in a democracy, and I'm not willing to let this
kind of legislation further limit what we can see and hear.]{.font4}

[There are already laws on the books I think that can protect people who
get into the kinds of conditions that the previous speaker was in, and
there are others that we can promote. I think we can promote equal
opportunity in employment so that you have people running communications
systems, for example, of both sexes, where you are less likely to get
programming that doesn't take the needs of women seriously.]{.font4}

[Censorship legislation will not and never can take care of the problems
of what children see and hear on television or on video or anywhere
else, and the fact that the government is willing to step in and make
the rules might cause some parents to think they don't have to pay
attention, and that would be doing parents a tremendous disservice.
Thank you.]{.font4}

[KAREN HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm testifying under a pseudonym,
Karen Harrison. I live in the New Bedford area. I've had many
experiences with sex discrimination directly linked to pornography. Some
of these were harmful to me physically, but all of them were harmful to
me emotionally. I've had six abusive relationships and four of these six
involved pornographic indignities. These are as follows. For each of the
men I am going to refer to, I am using their real first names.]{.font4}

[The first one was Carl, who was a bisexual child molester. He followed
and collected child porn, gay porn and enema porn publications. He
forced me to be photographed naked by him. He pressured me to come on to
young teenage boys in the town. He'd try to get them home with me so he
could get to them. When I would not do this, he would criticize my age,
my looks, and would get violent. He also wanted me to come on to
hitchhikers he would frequently pick up in the seat next to me. He
wanted me \[to\] pick them up and bring them home and start a sexual
session with them while he watched or could join in. When I would not do
this, he got angry and violent. These were ideas he read about in gay
and kiddie porn publications of how to get victims to come to your home.
Porn materials were always kept on hand. He wanted me to do the kinky
things that he read about in magazines. I remember one article in
particular that he made me read. It was about a man who threatened to
leave his wife if she didn't stop \[inaudible\]. So he began to retrain
her. Every time he brought home a certain briefcase it would have a
kinky surprise, a sexy surprise, that she would have to submit to. The
first surprise was an enema. The surprises got more and more bizarre
until the woman admitted that she started to like them and was
disappointed if he didn't bring the briefcase home. One of the last
surprises mentioned was putting chocolate Hershey's
kisses---unwrapped---up the woman's rear end and then she would squat
over his face and squeeze them all into his mouth with her bowel
muscles. He asked me to do this and I refused.]{.font4}

[I was forced to shave my pubic area to look like the little girls in
the magazines. He made constant comments in public to peers and family
about how much I put out and if it was performed to his standards. Some
of the magazines kept in the house were]{.font4} [High Times,
Hustler]{.font4}[;]{.font4} [National Lampoon, Penthouse, Playboy,
Swedish Erotica]{.font4}[---Swedish porn and kiddie porn. He forced me
to watch him perform oral sex on a \[dog\]. He molested several children
in my care, unknown to me, and I found out \[after he\] left me. He
\[found out\] and raped me with several of his friends.]{.font4}

[The second relationship was with a man named Jim who worked in a
bookstore warehouse supply company in the New Bedford area\.... They had
a poor inventory system. He stole porn magazines and books by the
boxload. There were stacks and stacks of them on both sides of the bed
and out in the rooms where guests, including my parents, could see them.
He would refuse to move them and got violent when asked to. He forced me
to spend hours and weeks on the beach getting painful sunburns so I
would be tan and sexy like the girls in the pictures. He forced me to
look at pictures of men and women defecating and puking on each other.
He would have parties with his male friends. He would pass these
magazines out and give some away as gifts. I was the only female in the
room on these occasions. I was forced to wait on them, distributing beer
and sandwiches while they openly commented sexually about the women in
the pictures. They would get drunk and put me down for not having big
boobs like the women in the pictures. If I tried to leave the room or
got insulted during any of these times, he would get angry and hit me. I
was stupid and oversensitive. Most girls don't care if men look at porn,
I was told.]{.font4}

[He made no secret of needing these magazines to get turned on enough to
touch me. I was forced to participate in a bondage episode that he read
about. He forced me to pose nude for a photographer, playing with
myself, in Rhode Island for money, all of which he kept because he could
not keep a job at this time. He collected these magazines religiously
and hurt me if I moved, touched or acted wrongly in any way. I was
beaten so severely while I was pregnant by this man that I miscarried
and had internal damage and bleeding because I was no longer attractive
like the girls in the pictures. They had flat stomachs, I was told. He
read a story in a magazine about a woman who would take baths in ice
cubes to be cold a half an hour before the husband would come home, and
she would powder herself with white powder so she would look dead and
\[then they had\] sex. I was asked to try this.]{.font4}

[During all this, he began drinking and gambling heavily. When we broke
up, I found an unpaid \$500 telephone bill in my name to the 900 sex
numbers found in the backs of these magazines.]{.font4}

[My next relationship was with a man named Michael. He was a
pornographic movie and pornographic magazine fanatic. He collected tapes
of porn movies and kept them in our clothes drawers instead of our
clothes. He was the most proud of the Traci Lords tapes from when she
was underage. He forced me to watch these movies with him and suggested
I watch them while he was at work. He would even quiz me when he came
home to see if I had. He would force me to have sex with him during
these movies in positions where he could still see the movies, or move
me to one side so that he could still see them. If I got insulted about
this, he got angry and violent and turned it around so that it became my
fault and I had to apologize.]{.font4}

[He forced me to go to VCR shops and pick out sex tapes with me openly.
One movie in particular he forced me to watch and reenact was
called]{.font4} [The Story of]{.font4} [O. He threatened to leave me if
I didn't perform kinky or \[inaudible\] acts. During this time, he was
drinking heavily and using pot and coke. Another one of the movies he
wanted to act all the sex scenes out with me was]{.font4}
[9[1/]{.sgc-5}2 Weeks]{.font4}[.]{.font4}

[One of these kinky acts I was forced to do was to cut a hole in an army
cot that lined up with his crotch. He would lay naked on his stomach and
poke his penis through the hole and I would have to lay underneath and
perform oral sex. He read this in the kinky column of a magazine that it
was a wife\'s gift to her husband. He had our sex and lovemaking
videotaped and showed it to all his friends the next day while I was at
work. He said we could destroy it, but later that day I couldn't find it
and he told me to forget about it.]{.font4}

[He tied me up and blew strawfuls of cocaine up into my nose and then
would rape me. He read this in a porn magazine that said that coke would
turn women on and I would not take the coke willingly. He wanted me to
do the things he saw the people in the movies do, like have sex with
other people, other couples, and especially with other women. He wanted
to come home and find me having sex with women like on the tapes. He
told me that this was one of his biggest fantasies, and he tried to
convince me that it was mine as well. He told me that if I felt guilty
about it, he would tie me up and I could pretend it wasn't my fault. He
forced me to have sex with sex toys bought through the back pages of the
sex magazines. He commented openly about our sex lives in front of me to
his friends while high on coke, pot, or \[inaudible\].]{.font4}

[He read a story in a fantasy column of a magazine about a man and a
woman acting out rape. He broke into my apartment and tried it on me. He
waited until I came home from work and he attacked me from behind in the
dark. He would tie me to the kitchen table and blindfold me and leave me
in the dark for hours and come home with friends to touch me sexually.
This was an idea he read in an article in a sex magazine about
brainwashing techniques. He would get high on cocaine and come home and
force me to have regular, anal and oral intercourse for hours and hours
and hours until I was raw, dry and bleeding. When I couldn't stand the
pain he would put cocaine on my vagina so he could keep going. He read
this in a magazine that said it would numb me and turn me on. He would
tie me up and put cigarettes out on my legs when I refused to have sex
with other people like in the movies and threaten to leave me.]{.font4}

[He put me in several situations with other people to sexually switch
partners, but I always left. He would stay for hours. He would spank me
and hit me frequently during sex like in the movies and the articles. He
forced me to dress in certain ways, day and evening, like the women in
the magazines and movies. He constantly criticized my weight and my
figure. I was forced to diet continuously and reminded at the table in
front of others what I was eating and how much.]{.font4}

[I was forced to be in the room with his male friends and swinging
couples during sex videos and wait on them. During these episodes, I was
forced to wear outfits and act certain ways at these times like the
hostess in those sex movies. He forced me to go to strip bars with him
and not get upset or he'd hurt me. One night, he even forced me to dance
and strip at one particular club on amateur night. He kept the money
that I made.]{.font4}

[He would pick and choose collector issues of porn magazines and I was
made to look and feel inferior to these women, especially blondes with
big breasts and women who posed sexually with other women. I was made to
feel inferior to the women on MTV constantly. Magazine pictures and
posters were hung on the walls whether I liked it or not. He began
touching me in public and wanting to have sex with me on a restaurant
table like a scene in a video movie that he made me watch one night over
and over and over and over.]{.font4}

[My next and final relationship was with a man named Patrick, a police
officer. He had a five-year-old son. His magazines were pornographic and
mixed with gun and vigilante magazines, and he kept opening them in the
bathroom and living room at all times, except when I first met him. I
was repeatedly raped throughout every day and several nights with his
handcuffs. I was forced to go to strip bars with him and eventually to
work there. It was his fantasy for me to strip for others but to go home
with him. He lost his job and kept the money I made working.]{.font4}

[He would force me to watch porn videos with his son in the next room
and then would rape me and use the language heard in the videos. For
example, I can't forget, he told me was going to split me in half with
his cock and I was a bitch and I was forced to admit I loved it and if I
didn't say this, he would hit me and rape me harder. He always spanked
me during sex and pulled my hair very hard like in the movies we
watched. He would leave me at home with no clothes or blankets to cover
up with while his five-year-old son was there so I couldn't leave him.
He drank and did coke in secret and took prescription drugs like Valium,
Percodan and codeine, and also fed them to me. He had several sex
magazines and books on brainwash methods and methods of control. He
raped me anally with handcuffs for hours one day while drunk because the
magazines told him that a woman's anus is tighter than her vagina and I
had refused to have anal sex with him. He touched me constantly in
public and in front of his son because the magazine's Kinky Corner said
that if you do it in public, it's more exciting. He bought many of these
videos from vendors who sold them out of the backs of their vans and at
flea markets.]{.font4}

[About this time, I began to realize that sex is not love and money
can't buy love, but maybe it can buy freedom. So I wanted to make enough
money to escape these men and, in particular, the New Bedford area and
the life I had led up until now. I went back to the strip bars to make
money. I cannot tell you the lie and the fantasy that it is for men.
Waitressing, I cleaned the floors and I own a box of men's wedding rings
that I found on the floor. I have come to believe from these experiences
that most men are scum.]{.font4}

[The degradation and inferiority and humiliation of being presented as
two tits and a hole for entertainment was not as bad as the sexual
harassment I received from the management of these places. Customers are
not allowed to touch you, but management can and does. You cannot
complain to the Labor Board because they say you put yourself there
willingly, and usually it's under the table. I felt worthless, but I
need enough money to move and complete college and get a
degree.]{.font4}

[Because of these experiences I have been made to feel so inferior that
I was saving and had planned for breast implants. I had dyed my hair
blonde and ruined it at one point. I weighed 86 pounds. I now have
severe emotional and medical issues, revolving around the stress,
physical punishment and trauma I have gone through. I have come to
realize that this pain will never go away. Thank you.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I want to know if any of these individuals
have been prosecuted for what they did.]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No. They're all walking around. The last
one, the police weren't going to do anything about it because he was a
police officer and his father was the chief of police for thirty-two
years in that town.]{.font4} 

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you still receiving counseling?]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, I am. They're helping me emotionally
and physically, but no prosecution has been pushed at this point. The
battered women's society in New Bedford did try and push for a detective
to come to my home and get samples of water and food and it was tested
and found to have arsenic at the crime lab in Boston. And it's been a
year and we have never heard another thing.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you still actively pursuing
prosecution?]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm terrified of these people, the last one
in particular. The police officer has a history. He hurt several other
women before me. And there's a history on all these men.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Had you ever filed a complaint in the police
department where this police officer works?]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. They made me submit to having my blood
taken and urinating to test the arsenic levels and they made a male
detective go in a room with me while I urinated to see that I wasn't
poisoning myself. So I was just so victimized by all of this that I
moved and I'm just trying to pick up the pieces and try to be a whole
person again.]{.font4}

[\[Question: How long were the relationships? \]]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1}[\... The first man, Carl, was five years. The
second man, Jim, was five years. The third man was three and a half, and
the police officer was between six and nine months.]{.font4}

[\[Question: What caused you to end each of them? \]]{.font4}

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The first incident, when I found he was
molesting children in my care. I was hurt as a child and I couldn't
condone that. The second incident, he was cheating on me, and she got
pregnant, and he married her. The third incident, I said pick me or
coke. I want a conventional life. No more of this. And he picked
coke.]{.font4}

[\[Question: Was there a possibility of physical violence if you left?
\]]{.font4} 

[HARRISON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. I was always told in several of these
relationships that no other man would ever have me. It would be him or
I'd be dead.]{.font4}

[WENDY KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm a public policy fellow at Radcliffe
College. I'm an attorney and a writer. I was also briefly of the women's
movement against pornography in the late 1970s, and I have some sympathy
for women's fears of pornography. Some of it is violently misogynist. I
also worked on 42nd Street for several years as an attorney in the New
York City Mayor's office and I am here to testify against
H5194.]{.font4}

[It violates the First Amendment, and I wouldn't worry too much about
what the framers thought about pornography. The framers didn't think
that women should have the right to vote. This bill is also bad for
women. Censorship campaigns in this country, of which this is a part,
have always targeted sex education, information about abortion and birth
control. This is a bill that both Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly
would love. It demonizes speech, it scapegoats speech, often a quick fix
for undesirable behavior. Jerry Falwell, for example, has claimed that
sex education makes teenagers pregnant, as some feminists claim that
pornography makes men commit rape. In fact, human behavior is a bit more
complicated and variable than that. Attempting to control antisocial
speech overestimates the power of words as much as it undervalues the
right to utter them. The relationship between violence in the media and
violence in real life is complex and variable. Different people respond
to the same images differently. And while the idealization of violence
may have a cumulative effect on behavior, no single image\' isn't in any
simple way the cause of any single act.]{.font4}

[But this bill does more than assume, without foundation, that
pornography is a clear and present call to sex discrimination. It's said
that pornography]{.font4} [is]{.font4} [sex discrimination. Advocates of
this bill deny that it constitutes censorship because they deny that
pornography is speech---and that is simply Orwellian. The line between
speech and behavior is sometimes blurred. Dancing nude down a public
street is surely a way of expressing yourself. It may also be a form of
disorderly conduct. But if pornography is a form of sex discrimination,
then an editorial criticizing the president is a form of treason. If
pornography is \[a\] form of sex discrimination, then by testifying
before this Committee, defending people's rights to publish and read
pornography, I am participating in the exploitation of women. You might
as well make me liable for sex discrimination.]{.font4}

[This bill will, in fact, do nothing to eliminate sex discrimination or
sexual violence. At best, it is a distraction from the problems women
face. At worst, it is a lie. If you want to combat the bad speech that
you believe contributes to sexual violence, combat it with good speech
of your own. Find a way to introduce programs on violence and changing
gender roles in the public schools. If you want to do something for
teenagers who are caught up in the pornography business, find a way to
provide good schooling, drug treatment programs and foster care for
children from broken homes or no homes at all. If you do want to do
something about spouse abuse, find a way to increase employment for men
and women so that husbands don't come home and kick their wives out of
frustration, and wives don't have to stay in abusive marriages because
they can't afford to support themselves. Focus on the underlying causes
of violence and the actual---not the metaphoric---instruments of it.
Remember that in Florida, where some consider rap music too lethal to be
legal, almost anyone can buy a gun. Thank you.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm an attorney. I practiced law for several
years as a legal aid attorney and I worked in the Mayor's office in New
York for several years in a special project on 42nd Street in part
dealing with the pornography business. I'm also a writer.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think we should be honest about this, and
if you want to make a legislative finding---and I don't know how you'll
do this---that pornography causes violence, if you want to say that
pornography is sex discrimination, don't pretend that you are doing this
consistent with the First Amendment. We can call any kind of speech that
we don't like "behavior, " and if we do that, we might as well get rid
of the First Amendment. There are people who think that feminist
literature is an attack on the nuclear family, that it's not just
speech, it's behavior. It's socially subversive behavior. It makes a
mockery of the First Amendment. Without pornography, we would still have
violence against women. The causes are much more complicated and much
harder to deal with. \[Question inaudible about coercion\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would categorize it as a crime. I think
coercion and assaults are crimes and they are dealt with \[by\] the
criminal law, to the extent that this bill would deal with coercing
people to make pornographic movies. Coercing people sexually is
redundant. To the extent that it deals with speech, it is
unconstitutional.]{.font4}

[We're entering a video age. We're entering what some people consider a
post-literate age. A lot of communication is done through film and video
images. There are people who think that the work of Robert Mapplethorpe
is as dangerous as some feminists think that pornography is
dangerous.]{.font4}

[I don't deny that pornography may be a problem. We live in a very
violent society and pornography is a part of that. It affects every one
of us. But I view pornography as a social problem, not a legal problem,
by which I mean that it is not a problem amenable to legal solutions.
Not as long as we have the First Amendment.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I don't believe the people simply copy what
they see in the movies. A lot of us see the same movies and we don't go
out and shoot people. I just don't think it's as simple as that. Maybe
the acts wouldn't be the same, and people would have to use their own
diseased imaginations to figure out what to do, but they would figure it
out.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [There's a bill before the Senate Judiciary
Committee now---the Violence Against Women Act---that is one good way to
approach this problem. It makes gender-based violence a civil rights
violation in the same way that acts of racial violence are civil rights
violations. That is not an act that affects speech. It looks at
violence---it looks at spouse abuse and rape and other sexual assaults.
I think that's a much better way to approach the problem. It certainly
sends a very important symbolic message to people that assaulting women,
that assaulting anybody, because of their sex is a violation of their
civil rights. I think that's a very important principle.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[They're\] calling speech "behavior. " That
doesn't change the fact that it is speech.]{.font4}

[\[Question inaudible\]]{.font4}

[KAMINER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think the only way you can address the
constitutional problems of this bill is to dispense with the bill. I
have not addressed the details of it but the problems of it, and there
are a lot of them because I think the basic concept of it is flawed. I
think you cannot call pornography an act of sex discrimination. I think
that is Orwellian.]{.font4}

[\[end of first tape\]]{.font4}

[L. B.:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[portion not recorded\] Once this videotape
was on, he would make me submit to various sexual acts on the hardwood
floors directly in front of a television set. Since we lived in an
apartment building, he was very paranoid about neighbors finding out
what he was doing, so he always threatened to "fuck me up" if I so much
as whimpered or made any sound above a whisper. Even though the sound on
the pornographic tape was off, he continually sent me to the door of the
room to make sure the keyhole was covered, the door locked, and/or
barricaded, and to listen for anyone walking down the hall. Meanwhile, I
was to keep coming back to him to do whatever he wanted sexually. He
wanted me to watch how the various women in the video performed oral sex
on the men. And then he insisted that I do the same with him while he
continued to watch that movie. If I didn't go down on him far enough or
hard enough, he would put his hands on my head and push it up and down,
sometimes so hard that I thought I would faint. If I gagged or choked,
he would pull me up by my hair, throw me back onto the floor, hit and
kick me, and verbally abuse me, calling me "worthless, " "useless, " and
"a waste of his time. " Then he would make me watch that video again,
perform oral sex, and threaten to "break my jaw if I stopped. "]{.font4}

[Then he would make me turn around, get down on my hands and knees, and
he would force intercourse, both vaginal and anal. While he did this, he
insisted that I watch that video from whatever position I was in, so
that I could learn more. He would not let me get up or change positions,
even if I was in terrible pain. He'd ask me which men in that video I
liked and whether they were as big or as good as he. Well, I quickly
learned to say yes, that he was even better, otherwise the sex would
become even more forceful and painful. Again, if I did not perform
adequately in any position, he would threaten to go out and find a whore
who knew what she was doing, like the women in that video. He said
continually that he wanted to turn me out, which meant turn me into a
prostitute, and then]{.font4} [we]{.font4} [could make a pornographic
movie too. But I had to keep watching that video in order to learn the
skills and the techniques.]{.font4}

[A number of times after watching the video, he actually took me to some
filthy places, often crack houses, telling me that he felt that I was
ready, that I was his whore, and that he knew men who would pay big
bucks for me. But I had to do it right, I had to please them, or else he
and I would be in danger. In hallways, in stairwells, in basements, and
bathrooms of crack houses, in seedy hotels, in apartments where
sometimes there were small children in cribs, my partner offered me like
a prize to numerous men and women. He would force me to strip and seduce
them, all the while coaching me, instructing me, talking to me as if
from that video, even when he was having sex with other women in the
same room. He once traded me for cocaine to a man who forced me to have
sex with him at knifepoint. After all this, we went home to the video,
that pornographic video, and the abuse continued. My partner pointed out
to me what I didn't do right, what I should have done, what I could have
done much better. That video became my nightmare. Every time he made me
turn it on, I became sick with fear for I knew that I was in for hours
of verbal abuse, physical pain and sexual torture. And I was trapped. If
I protested, if I tried to leave, if I made but a sound, he would
threaten to break every bone in my body and put me in the hospital. And
sometimes I wished I]{.font4} [had]{.font4} [gone to the hospital, just
to get away from that video. Thank you.]{.font4}

at censorship. It is a resurrection of the infamous Indianapolis
pornography statute, which the courts, as you have heard, have already
struck down. The ACLU national office filed an]{.font4} [amicus]{.font4}
[brief in the Indianapolis case.]{.font4}

[I don't think this is a proposal to aid women and children or to
prevent violence, but it's really just a justification for censorship
measures. I'm someone who believes passionately in the First Amendment,
and I'm truly appalled to see a whole generation of young women being
taught that censorship is acceptable in a free society, and that
creating the potential for ruinous money damages based on the supposedly
harmful effects of pornography will not punish any other form of
artistic expression.]{.font4}

[And I really can speak from experience. When I was in college in the
early '50s, you couldn't read]{.font4} [Lady Chatterley's Lover]{.font4}
[in this country. We had strict censorship laws, and a friend of mine
smuggled that book through customs, thereby risking arrest, and
circulated \[it\] in our dormitory. English majors got put first on the
top of the list. I think that what happens and what people always forget
is that hard-core pornography exists quite happily underground even when
you have very strict censorship laws. In Victorian times, which was the
most prudish age that we know of, hard-core porn was widely circulated
underground. What happens is that things of artistic merit, things that
are on the cutting edge of artistic expression, are the things that
always get censored. And I think that what will get censored first is
feminist works. They will be the first ones to go under an ordinance
like this.]{.font4}

[I think also behind censorship drives is a hidden agenda. They
mentioned the right wing, the Moral Majority. Two of the books most
often banned from libraries \[and\] schools are]{.font4} [Slaughterhouse
Five]{.font4} [by Kurt Vonnegut and]{.font4} [The Diary of Anne
Frank.]{.font4} [Now, the Vonnegut book is always banned because it has
sex and bad language in it---not too much different, I think, than his
other books, which also have sex and bad language. That particular book
contains a devastating picture of the fire bombing of Dresden by the
American Air Force. The agenda for]{.font4} [The Diary of Anne
Frank]{.font4} [is not so hidden. It was banned on the West Coast by a
group which said, "It perpetuates the myth that the Holocaust really
happened. "]{.font4}

[I would urge you to give this bill an unfavorable report, and to go
forward with things that will really help women, some of the women that
you have heard today. For instance, funds for battered women's shelters
were cut in this year's budget. In the proposed budget for 1993, the
governor removed all the funds for battered women's shelters. Drug and
alcohol abuse is very often a symptom or a cause of violence and abuse.
I think that if we're serious about it, we will put the funds back in
the drug and alcohol abuse programs. Those were cut 16 percent in FY92.
And that means that about 6, 000 people are on the waiting list for drug
and alcohol abuse programs. I think that if you are serious about
helping women who have had violence in their lives, these are the kinds
of things that you will do. Thank you.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Any questions? Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[CATHARINE MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, I've just given you
a resume and a short book by me and Andrea Dworkin on the civil rights
approach to pornography, of which this bill is an instance.]{.font4}

[Your constituents, the women who have testified to you about their
experiences, have told you something of what it has done to their lives
to live in a society surrounded by pornography, a society saturated with
pornography, in which the pornography currently has more protection than
the women do. So long as it is available as it is now, these things they
have told you about will continue to be done to them, as they are now
being done, and to others like them, because they are women.]{.font4}

[I wish I could tell you that this happens only in Massachusetts. But
based on the experience that Andrea Dworkin and I have had with
pornography worldwide, and in particular with this bill---which leads
women to believe that if they come forward, they will be listened to for
the first time---we've found that the reach of pornography is
nationwide, indeed it is global. It is documented by scholars and
researchers from studies, as well as by women like those you have
listened to, from their lives.]{.font4}

[This empire of organized crime---which is what it is---this practice of
abuse, torture and slavery, is nothing other than a technologically
sophisticated and highly profitable form of trafficking in women. It
first exploits and abuses the women, children and sometimes men in it,
in order to make the materials. Then when the materials are
mass-produced, so is the abuse, as consumers---as you have heard---act
it out and take it out on the women around them in all kinds of ways,
from seeing women as less than human, using them as objects for sexual
abuse, to rape and murder. By making inequality sexy---which is the very
particular thing that pornography does---by making the denigration of
women sexually pleasurable to the consumer, pornography generates these
massive violations of civil and human rights that you have just begun to
hear about today.]{.font4}

[Should you need any further graphic testimony, the pornography itself
will supply it to you. In there, you will see women and children being
violated, being humiliated, tortured, whipped, chained, burned, bound,
gagged, suffocated, on a continuum of use and abuse, beginning in
objectification like]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [and continuing through
racist and misogynist vilification and sadomasochistic abuse, and
sometimes ending in death as in snuff films, in which a woman or a child
is actually murdered in order to make a sex film.]{.font4}

[The proposed law that you're considering today faces that reality and
calls it by its real name and would be effective in stopping
it.]{.font4}

[I have been asked by the Women's and Children's Civil Rights Campaign
to speak to you a little about how this law would work. I would like to
do that for a couple of minutes, and then I would like to address two of
the questions that have been asked by you. One, why is this law needed?
Why isn't existing law adequate to this? And the other is the Chairman's
question about constitutionality.]{.font4}

[This law would give those who are victimized through pornography access
to court to prove their injuries and to seek relief. It defines
pornography in law for the first time. It defines it as the graphic
sexually explicit subordination of women, or anyone else, that also
includes a range of abusive, subordinating and dehumanizing
presentations. Only materials that are graphic, not simulated or
implied, that are sexually explicit--- that is, presenting sex acts or
sexualized or fetishized body parts---and, in addition, that actually
subordinate women, either those in the materials, or can be proven to
subordinate other women in the world, are covered. And, of course, if
men, children or transsexuals are used in these same ways, they would
also be covered.]{.font4}

[The first cause of action would give those who are coerced into
pornography, through fraud, force or pressure, such as Linda "Lovelace"
who was coerced into the film]{.font4} [Deep Throat,]{.font4} [the right
to sue both those who did the coercion---what we think of as the lesser
pimps---and those up the food chain, who feed off of them, the bigger
pimps, those who dignify themselves as publishers, as distributors,
those who make the really big money off of women's abuse. To reach these
materials removes the main material incentive, the profit, the
money---other than the sex itself, which is also an incentive---for
doing this kind of coercion. No existing law addresses these materials
based on the coercion in them. Anything less than stopping the coerced
materials simply encourages the pornographers to violate women and run
with the videotape.]{.font4}

[The cause of action for forcing pornography on a person would give
anyone who could prove pornography was aggressively thrust on them a
claim against the person who forced it on them---in their home, in
school, in doctors' offices, in employment.]{.font4}

[The defamation claim would give women who are used in pornography
against their will---who have often been feminists who oppose the
pornographers, and have their heads spliced in over other women's
bodies, or have pornographic lies written about their lives---it would
give them a form of relief where currently none exists.]{.font4}

[The claim for assault would give anyone who can prove that specific
pornography directly caused their attack or assault a claim against the
pornography's makers, its sellers, and its distributors, as well as a
claim against the direct attacker. What this part of the law does is it
holds the pornographers responsible, under very limited and
difficult-to-prove but possible-to-prove conditions, for the devastation
they caused. Think about the testimony that you have been hearing today,
and the possibilities of proving that each of these assaults were
directly caused by specific pornography. They have the specific
pornography, \' they have the assault, and they have what]{.font4} [they
have to say]{.font4} [about that cause.]{.font4}

[The trafficking provision, which covers, in this instance,]{.font4}
[only]{.font4} [the visual materials, provides access to court to seek
relief from this massive array of violation and violence, this
subordination, and all these acts of second-class status in which
pornography is instrumental, when it can be proven that it is
instrumental.]{.font4}

[Now I would like to talk about the several questions that have come up
about whether there is existing legal relief for these kinds of
abuses.]{.font4}

[This law is needed, we think, because the legal system really is doing
nothing effective to prevent or redress injuries like these, like a
great many that the women have spoken about this morning. Lawyers\...are
very fond of fancy theories that will make existing law cover all
existing problems. But the problems of inequality, that come from being
a member of a socially disadvantaged group historically, are not yet
very well understood by law. The law has not until very recently been
designed with any of them in mind, so it doesn't tend to work well for
them. For example, sexual harassment could in theory have been covered
by tort law, by a law of assault, or by intentional infliction of
emotional distress. But nothing effective was done about it by law until
it was called the right name, which is discrimination based on sex. And
I remind you that a substantial percentage of sexual harassment is
words. Lynching is another example. It should have been illegal as
murder, but nothing effective was done about it by law until it was
called its right name: discrimination based on race.]{.font4}

["Obscenity" is the only legal name we have for anything like what we
have heard here today. But nowhere in the legal definition of obscenity
do you find the rape, sexual harassment, sexual abuse of children, or
prostitution that we have heard about. In theory, films of rapes, snuff
films in which people are murdered, are therefore protected speech.
Child pornography could or should, in all of this creative legal
theorizing, have been effectively addressed by obscenity law. We had
obscenity law. But it was not until the state of New York called child
pornography what it is, and legislated against it based on recognizing
its harm to children---which is wholly apart from anything the obscenity
definition addresses---that anything effective was done about it. That
law was opposed by many, including by Mr. Bamberger, who testified
earlier today, on grounds that the law against child pornography
violated the First Amendment. ^2^]{.font4}

[2. Michael A. Bamberger argues that New York's law recognizing child
pornography as an act of child abuse violates the First Amendment in his
Brief on behalf of American Booksellers Association, Inc., Association
of American Publishers, Inc., Council for Periodical Distributors
Associations, Freedom to Read Foundation, International Periodical
Distributors Association, Inc., National Association of College Stores,
Inc., American Civil Liberties Union, The Association of American
University Presses, Inc., New York Civil Liberties Union, and St.
Martin's Press, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.
747 (1982).]{.font3}

[The Media Coalition for which he spoke, and which he represents, it
might be noted, exists to protect, in quotes, sexually explicit
materials. Sexually explicit materials are \[also\] exactly those which
existing child pornography laws prohibit and which the Supreme Court has
found consistent with the First Amendment to criminalize. The real name
of what we are here to discuss today is pornography, and it is a
practice of discrimination, violence and bigotry on the basis of sex. In
the face of its overwhelming reality, to say that existing law is
adequate amounts to saying that the existing level of abuse of women is
acceptable. This shows the worst kind of callousness, human
disidentification, and complacency. And it also raises the question, if
all these problems---the problem of Pat, the problem of Karen---if all
of these problems can be solved by existing law---what L. B. just told
you about---why are they not being solved? Why has the pornography
industry quadrupled in the last twenty years, as these supposedly
adequate laws are on the books?]{.font4}

[As the Supreme Court of Canada recognized in its recent decision,
finding harm to women and equality as the basis for regulating
pornography in that country, it rejected appeals to education and victim
assistance as exclusive approaches to the problem of pornography, and
wisely noted that what we need are multiple approaches to this problem.
We have learned that this problem is socially invisible until women make
it visible. This particular law, this bill that you have before you
today, which puts power in women's hands, instead of suppressing the
pornography, and with it women's injuries, what it would do in reality
is to bring them out in the open, as it has done here today. It would
bring them out into the light, by making it possible to actually do
something effective about it for the first time.]{.font4}

[Now with the Chairman's indulgence, I would address briefly the
constitutionality question that he raised.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON: I]{.font7 .sgc-1} [appreciate the Chairman's indulgence. The
only constitutional question that has been raised here, and I assume
it's the one you want discussed, is the First Amendment. I think that is
the only one that's ever been seriously raised.]{.font4}

[The First Amendment test that exists in this country is that the harm
that materials do is to be weighed against the value that the materials
have. And under that test, a great many things have been found not to be
First Amendment-protected speech. One of them is child pornography, on
the theory that it does more harm than whatever good these materials do
as speech---that the harm is too much, we do not tolerate that, whatever
speech value these things may have. What the case that has been
discussed by William Hudnut and Mr. Bamberger did, was turn that test on
its head, and for that reason is simply legally wrong. What it did is,
it conceded that pornography causes harm. Indeed, all this discussion
about the causation issue---which I must say testimony such as Karen's
makes mincemeat out of. I mean, you can only have causation between two
things if you can separate them. How do you separate the pornography
from her abuse? There is no such separation.]{.font4}

[What that Court found in Indianapolis---that is, the Appeals Court---
was that pornography]{.font4} [does]{.font4} [cause all the abuses that
the women here today have been saying it causes. There is no dispute
about it, and there is no dispute about it in the law. \[The Court\]
found that pornography produces rape and sexual abuse. The Court found
that it makes women be second-class citizens on the street. It found
that it even contributes to unequal pay at work. However, what that
Court said is, that]{.font4} [that]{.font4} [merely shows us how
valuable pornography is as speech. In other words, the harm that it does
is the measure of its value. That's exactly the opposite of the Supreme
Court's approach. The Supreme Court's approach is, the harm that it does
has to be measured]{.font4} [against]{.font4} [its value. So it's just
simply wrong in law. The Supreme Court of the United States accepted it
as a conclusion, but did not by its procedure endorse any of its
reasons. That's what a summary affirmance does. There was no argument.
There were three dissents, saying that they wanted to hear argument, and
that was before all the recent changes in the composition of the Supreme
Court, so what we have seen here is---]{.font4}

[\[interruption by DiMasi inaudible\]]{.font4}

[What \[the judge\] does is, he transforms what is being done to women
into an idea about something being done to women. But in the process,
the court accepts that the pornography does do these things to women.
Unambiguously.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible discussion including reading an
excerpt from the opinion in]{.font4} [American Booksellers v.
Hudnut]{.font4} [by Judge Easterbrook\]]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I do believe I'm in the state of
Massachusetts where you have a group defamation law, just as a matter of
note. As a result, the kinds of materials that he \[Easterbrook\] is
using there as a defense---that is, why it is that this, too, should be
protected---are kinds of materials that are already criminal in this
state.]{.font4}

[Now beyond that, the issue is that what he has done is take
materials---see, he slips mentally. Sometimes Judge Easterbrook is able
to focus on subordination as an act, and he understands that pornography
subordinates women, and he accepts the legislative conclusion that it
does. And he stated it in an excerpt that you didn't read---eloquently,
vigorously, clearly, and accurately. Where he says, causes rape and
injury, causes harm in the workplace, even contributes to inequality of
pay, and so on.]{.font4} [He]{.font4} [said that. All I am saying is
that, as to the causation question, that Court recognized that we have
won that issue. The causation has been established.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [OK, let's assume there's causation, what about
the definition of pornography?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. Then Judge Easterbrook went on to
disagree with the definition and say that what this does is, it
establishes an "approved viewpoint" about women. Basically there are two
things wrong with that, legally speaking. One thing is that, once again,
he has taken what he had recognized as an abusive act and turned it back
into an idea. He doesn't seem to be able to keep a grip on the fact that
pornography is being addressed here for what it]{.font4} [does.]{.font4}
[One can continue to say the things that are]{.font4} [said]{.font4} [in
pornography. What you have to prove under this law is that they are
being]{.font4} [done]{.font4} [through the materials.]{.font4}

[Part of what Easterbrook was addressing, of course, is the words-only
materials\.... As the trafficking provision mobilizes the definition,
what Judge Easterbrook was largely disagreeing with, if you check his
examples, are almost all words-only materials. So it was harder for him
to get a grip on the fact that we're talking about something being done.
But if they're visual materials, it first of all has got to be done to
somebody---]{.font4}[done,]{.font4} [or it isn't there. And then
somebody has to prove what is done through it. This is a bill about
getting access to court so we can try to prove what is being
done---that's all. So he was thinking that it was a thought being
thought. Now, if all it is is a thought being thought, that's a defense,
because no woman can prove that an act was done. You can't prove
subordination occurred. So, \'there are some confusions.]{.font4}

[The other thing that's wrong with it, is that nothing requires the
State of Massachusetts to be neutral between equality and inequality.
And Judge Easterbrook seemed to be of the view that if we legislate
against inequality, that's a viewpoint discrimination because we haven't
equally legislated against equality, or something. But the state is
permitted to take a viewpoint in its law. You're permitted to be against
child pornography. You don't have to equally take the view that you can
be for child pornography and therefore when you prohibit it, that's an
impermissible viewpoint discrimination. So it's completely reversed
logic. It is, to borrow a term, Orwellian. It calls things the opposite
of what they are, and then says you can't \[stop them\].]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Actually, Judge Easterbrook did not find
the ordinance vague. When you read the decision you will see him saying,
indeed it is, as he put it, all too clear. It was very clear to him what
was being addressed here. It was also, I would add, very clear to the
real pornographers who intervened in this action and attempted to say,
"Excuse us, but the American Booksellers, I don't know about what it is
that they do, but we, the ISSI Theaters, are the real people against
whom this is directed, and we would like to be heard as well. " Now,
presumably---and this is speculation on my part---there was some
behind-the-scenes stuff, and \[they said\], "Wait a second, we the
American Booksellers look an awful lot better defending this action than
you people coming out from under a rock. You don't make a good
presentation in public. You're the real thing. Stay out of this, just
let us try to fudge the issue by making it seem as though we are you,
and you are us, and anything that prohibits what you do, will prohibit
what we do. We put a good face on your business. " So, that's a certain
way of addressing your question, which is to say, the pornographers know
what they do.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[questions concerning the definition of
pornography as unconstitutional\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [His resolution was that it discriminates on
the basis of viewpoint, because, in our terms, it addresses only the
inequality, and not the equality also. In other words, it takes a
position by the state against an entire series of, what he called,
ideas, which we are saying was a total misconstruction of what the law
requires---it requires acts.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What I'm saying is, we can legislate
against inequality. For example, sexual harassment is a law against
inequality. And it is words. And defendants don't come in and say, "I
uttered protected speech, and you can't prohibit my speech based on its
viewpoint, " its viewpoint being what? Contempt for women, abuse of
women, subordination of women, actuated through words. Now that's just
to take an example that is overwhelmingly words-only.]{.font4}

[There is no First Amendment that says that one cannot take a position
against inequality. What we are dealing with here, is a need to do
something beyond what has already been done in law, and that is, to take
equality into account when we interpret protected speech.]{.font4}

[At the same time, in this particular instance, it's important to take
into account that women's speech is not protected by the First
Amendment. The women you have been hearing from have been silenced under
this supposed protection of speech. It is only this bill that makes it
possible for their speech to come to be heard and to be free. So there
are speech interests on both sides of this thing, but there are no
equality interests on the pornographer's side. It's an industry of
inequality.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Any questions from the panel? I thank you very
much.]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would be happy to be of whatever
assistance I could to the Committee in the future, if you should wish
it.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Actually, Andrea Dworkin and I are both
leading experts. She is here, yes, in the front row.]{.font4}

[ANDREA DWORKIN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I was not going to \[testify\] because
Catharine MacKinnon is really testifying on behalf of both of us. We
felt that it was so important that you be able to hear from women who've
actually had the experiences.]{.font4}

[\[Discussion inaudible\]]{.font4}

[SENATOR POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question about nude-only
videos that are made consensually\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Actually, they're not covered by this
bill---but not because of whether they're consensually made, but
because, the way you've described them, if it is nudity only, that
wouldn't necessarily be sexually explicit, and it has to be sexually
explicit; Nude only is not enough.]{.font4} 

[PANEL MEMBER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[question concerning desecration of the
American flag\]]{.font4} 

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What \[Judge Easterbrook\] is talking about
there is that one should be able to do something about materials that
are produced through coercion. There is currently no coercion-based law
that gives somebody who has been coerced into pornography any relation
to those materials. That is, because it is her, they are
hers\....]{.font4}

[Okay, now I'll talk about the American flag. You would like me to, so I
will. The American flag \[raises\] a question of symbolic
expression---that is to say, when you violate it, what you violate is
what it means to you.]{.font4} 

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [What it means to us collectively.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, what it means to everyone. So that
when it is defaced or violated or mutilated, what is being harmed is its
meaning and its place in the collective community. With pornography, we
are saying something different, and that is that a woman is not a
symbol, a woman is a human being.]{.font4}

[Certainly the meaning to all women of the fact that it is possible to
violate, mutilate, deface women in these ways is very clear. And the
clarity of it is that we are not full citizens, that we do not have full
rights, that when these kinds of things are done to us, that our
government does not stand up against that. Yes, it has that meaning to
all of us that see it. But more concretely, and what this law is
addressed to, is the actual injuries themselves, the mutilations, the
violations, the abuse, the subordination\... \[end of tape\] \[gap in
recording\]]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [That's a concern that I have, the plight of
women that are indirectly being affected by this, by their boyfriends,
or husbands or whatnot is as a result of women engaging in this activity
consensually. That's where pornography came from.]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [It's been our information that pornography
comes from pimps who want to make it and consumers who want to consume
it. That is, that it is both supply-and-demand-driven in that sense. It
is the pimps---the pornographers---who procure women for use, because
they can make money through manipulating the sexuality of men in this
entire culture to want to experience their sexuality in this way. And
then they do. And then that sexuality is acted out on other women, so
that you don't have women in your freely-consenting model waking up one
morning and saying, "Today is the day on which I make a free choice.
Today is the day in which I'm going to decide whether I want to be a
brain surgeon, or whether I want to go and find a man and spread my legs
for a camera. " That isn't how women get into pornography.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Are you saying that women in the videos and
magazines are all nonconsensual? It's all coercion?]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [No. What I'm saying is that the women are
in there because men will pay to see the things done to them that are
done. That's why they're there.]{.font4}

[And in addition to that, I'm trying to suggest that there is a larger
social context in which women are valued as and for sex, and that most
of these women were sexually abused as children. One of the major
consequences of that, that women fight for the rest of their lives, is
that it makes you experience that when you're being violated and abused,
you're being loved and valued and approved. And so the appearance of
consent, which is what they are highly prized for, is then what
communicates to the consumer and is part of the sexual arousal and then,
the world is to believe that the woman is "consenting" in some free
way.]{.font4}

[Now I want to be clear, as I attempted to initially here, that our law
does not assume that all pornography is coerced. It does not. And indeed
does not touch that question. Since there never has been a law that
allows women who]{.font4} [are]{.font4} [coerced to bring an action for
it, we don't know really how many there are, because there is nothing
they can do about it. They are overwhelmingly poor, they are totally
dispossessed, largely completely desperate. Many are actually underage.
Most of them started as children, so the distinction between child and
adult pornography is just the distinction between the same group of
people at a later point in time, if They live that long. They are
forcibly addicted to drugs, they are physically pimped to men for their
own individual use as well as the pornographers for their use. We're
talking about a massive group of exploited women here. The notion of
consent suggests a form of freedom that is not factually
accurate.]{.font4}

[The law, as I said, does not assume that everyone is coerced\.... At
the same time, I would urge you to face the reality here, which is that
these are not free women. These are not the women with the most choices
in society. If it is a free choice, I would like to know why it is the
women who have the fewest choices who are doing it.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question concerning payment to
women in pornography\]]{.font4}

[MacKINNON:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, very little, most of it skimmed off by
the pimp. I would suggest to you, with all respect, that it is the
success of the pimps' perspective when one comes to believe that the
women are overwhelmingly consenting to it. It's good for business that
we think this. That's why the conclusion is so widely promulgated in
society that women are doing it voluntarily or freely\....]{.font4}

[GAYLE MARKELS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee,
my name is Gayle Markels, and I'm vice president and counsel at the
Motion Picture Association of America. And on behalf of the Motion
Picture Association, which is a trade association representing many of
the major producers and distributors of motion pictures in the United
States today, such as Walt Disney, Columbia, Paramount, Twentieth
Century Fox, Universal, Orion, and Warner Brothers, I'd like to thank
you for this opportunity to appear before you in opposition to
H5194.]{.font4}

[I'd like to say from the beginning that the Motion Picture Association
is not opposed to legitimate efforts to combat violence. As a former
prosecutor in New York, I can state without equivocation that motion
pictures, books and magazines do not cause crime. Violence and crime
have their roots in poverty, drug and alcohol abuse, dysfunctional
families, and inadequate schools. Violence existed long before the
advent of motion pictures or even the written word. You could ban all
motion pictures, you could close every book store and every video store
tomorrow, and crime wouldn't go away. It's like so many quick fixes---it
simply just won't work.]{.font4}

[The Motion Picture Association believes that this legislation, which
subjects nonobscene speech to a never-ending cycle of litigation, should
be defeated for the following reasons:]{.font4}

[First, the proposal is unconstitutional because it goes far beyond what
the court has said can be used as a standard obscenity regulation. This
extremely broad definition of pornography would subject mainstream
filmmakers to civil litigation if a single party believes that the work
degrades women or if they believe that they or someone else is harmed by
the work. This standard is unworkable. The Supreme Court has repeatedly
stated that courts may not regulate nonobscene speech, either by
subjecting it to criminal or civil liability, and those points were
covered earlier so I'm not going to go into the American Booksellers
case.]{.font4}

[The definition of pornography, the sexually explicit subordination of
women, is so broad and so vague that mainstream producers of motion
pictures, books and magazines will not be able to determine what
fall ]{.font4}[within the statute's prohibitions. Under H5194, any woman
may bring a complaint as "a woman acting against the subordination of
women." Statutes that regulate speech must be drafted with precision.
This bill fails to provide adequate notice of what is included. The
chilling effect with such a vague definition of pornography will force
mainstream producers and distributors to cease distributing their works
to avoid threat of litigation.]{.sgc-3}

[The potential reach of this bill is endless. Academy Award-winning
films such as]{.font4} [The Accused,]{.font4} [which starred Jodie
Foster and depicted a rape and subsequent rape trial, could be included.
The Academy Award-winning film,]{.font4} [Two Women,]{.font4} [starring
Sophia Loren, which depicts the story of a mother and daughter in
war-torn Italy, could be included. Shakespeare's]{.font4} [The Taming of
the Shrew,]{.font4} [Pat Conroy's]{.font4} [The Prince of Tides, Gone
with the Wind,]{.font4} [James Bond, news reports and news footage,
paintings,]{.font4} [A Streetcar Named Desire,]{.font4} [I submit even
the Bible would fall within the parameters of this bill. If enacted,
motion picture theaters and video stores may be forced to. close their
doors, as filmmakers fearful of prosecution steer clear of the State of
Massachusetts.]{.font4}

[Moreover, H5194 is bad public policy because it permits criminals to
point their fingers and blame their crime on anybody other than
themselves. The legislation holds the wrong party accountable. Criminals
should be accountable for their crimes, not writers or filmmakers. H5194
doesn't even require that a criminal complaint be filed, or that a
conviction be obtained, before a victim may file a lawsuit suing a
bookseller or filmmaker. If you want to stop violence against women and
children, arrest those criminals responsible and punish them
immediately. Ask any cop. Movies don't cause crimes. Bring in the
prosecutors. Ask their opinion. Poverty, drug and alcohol abuse and guns
do.]{.font4}

[Finally, as a woman and a mother, I question whether women need
additional protection from the spoken, written and visual media.
Historically, women have been protected by society. We've been protected
from voting, we've been protected from working outside the home, and
we've been protected from higher education. Legislation which puts women
on a pedestal rarely improves our status in society. Censorship will not
improve the status of women. Protecting women through better
legislation, through job protection, through laws against
discrimination, through battered wife help---that would make a
difference. Further, we all possess the power of the dollar. If you
don't approve of a book or magazine, vote with your pocketbook. Go
somewhere else. In a free society, we cannot ]{.font4}[allow one group
to silence another. Censorship is a dangerous road. We urge the
Committee to vote against H5194\....]{.sgc-3}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible comment\]]{.font4}

[MARKELS:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I would like to say that this bill isn't
limited to pornography. The scope of this bill would address mainstream
products that anybody finds offensive or degrading. It is not limited to
the traditional, court-approved definition of pornography or obscenity.
That's why the mainstream film companies are concerned.]{.font4}

[FREDERICK SCHAUER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Mr. Chairman, my name is Frederick
Schauer. I am a member of the Massachusetts Bar, and I am the Frank
Stanton Professor of the First Amendment at the John F. Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard University. In addition to serving in 1985 and
1986 as one of the eleven commissioners of the Attorney General's
Commission on pornography, I am the author of]{.font4} [The Law of
Obscenity, Free Speech: A Philosophical Inquiry]{.font4} [and numerous
other writings on free speech, free press, and the legal and
constitutional aspects of obscenity and pornography. Prior to coming to
Harvard in 1990, I was professor of law at the University of Michigan,
and have been a law professor since I left the private practice of law
in 1974. Of course, not only do I not speak for the Kennedy School or
for Harvard University, I do not speak here on behalf of any individual,
corporation, institution, or organization---that being part of my own
long-standing practice of never entering into a client or consulting
relationship, whether paid or unpaid, believing that such a relationship
is inconsistent with my own views about academic independence.]{.font4}

[Speaking on behalf of myself, I find it a constant source of
astonishment that a society that so easily and correctly accepts the
possibility that a cute drawing of a camel can have such an effect on
the number of people who take up smoking, has such difficulty accepting
the proposition that endorsing images of rape or other forms of sexual
violence can have an effect on the number of people who take up rape. We
accept that movies glorifying advertisements for tobacco and alcohol may
be part of a social problem. But when the social problem is the massive
tolerance of sexual violence against women, we as a society are far less
willing to see that what are, in effect, advertisements for rape may
have a similar effect.]{.font4}

[In light of the Chairman's questions of a few minutes ago, I would like
to focus just on the constitutional questions, believing that my views
about the issue of images and sexual violence are probably apparent from
what I have just said.]{.font4}

[There has been some---but in my view insufficient---attention to the
focus or to the question of the meaning of the terms "graphic sexually
explicit. " Like many other legal terms, it is likely that that either
is, or would in the near future become, a term of art. There is no
reason to believe the term "graphic sexually explicit" is drastically
different in scope from what exists now within existing obscenity law.
Therefore, in light of existing understandings, pursuant to which,
although these are controversial understandings, they are existing
understandings in the caselaw nevertheless, pursuant to which highly
sexually explicit material has historically been viewed as either
outside the First Amendment or only on the periphery of the First
Amendment. Under existing law, the view that the limitation to "graphic
sexually explicit" is irrelevant is plainly erroneous.]{.font4}

[Let me talk for just a minute, purely as a predictive matter. As
Professor MacKinnon mentioned, three justices dissented in the]{.font4}
[Hudnut]{.font4} [case from the decision of the court to summarily
affirm. The Supreme Court had a year earlier, in a case called]{.font4}
[Anderson v. Celebrese,]{.font4} [said that summary affirmances are not
to be taken as having significant precedential effect. In addition, if
one takes the views of some number of other justices, Justice Scalia's
view---Scalia not having been on the court at the time---that existing
obscenity law is problematic, Justice Stephens' view in]{.font4} [Young
v. American Mini-Theaters,]{.font4} [that highly sexually explicit
material is on the periphery at best of the First Amendment---purely as
a predictive matter, it seems to me reasonably likely that the Supreme
Court of the United States as currently constituted would uphold a law
such as this, given its existing limitations of the graphic sexually
explicit.]{.font4}

[I do not mean to say that you may not exercise your own judgments about
what you think the First Amendment should require or should not require.
I do ask that you keep in mind the distinction between what some people
are saying that the First Amendment should require, and what it does. In
terms of what it, in fact, does require under existing interpretations
by the Supreme Court of the United States, this law is in some respects
substantially narrower than existing obscenity law.]{.font4} [Kaplan v.
California]{.font4} [in 1973 allowed existing obscenity law to be
applied to materials that were entirely verbal or linguistic, yet the
limitation in section IIE here contains no such limitation.]{.font4}

[DiMASI: \[time limit\]]{.font3 .sgc-1}

[SCHAUER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Certainly. I am happy to answer any questions
you want. My 30-second summary would be quite simple. The issue here,
whether the law can deal with material that both relates to the degree
of sexual violence in this society and is part of the degree of sexual
violence in this society, when limited to graphic sexually explicit
material, is a matter that on existing law is substantially unclear,
such that you should not take representations about its
unconstitutionality under existing law seriously. It is an issue that is
both in flux and unclear.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much.]{.font4}

[RICK KARPEL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Rick Karpel. I'm a director of
government relations for the Video Software Dealers Association. The
Video Software Dealers Association is a national trade group for
distributors and retailers of home video cassettes. We represent about
20, 000 of the 30, 000 video stores across the country. In
Massachusetts, we have approximately 125 member companies, representing
about 450 stores, and our members include large chains like Blockbuster
Video, Strawberries, and Tower Video, regional chains like Videosmith
and Endless Video, and nonspecialty outlets such as Stop & Shop, and
Shaw's supermarkets.]{.font4}

[I am here today to testify against House Bill 5194 for one simple
reason. If it passes, most video stores in the state will be forced out
of business. Why? Because the definition of pornography in this bill is
so vague and so overbroad that it would impact most of the material
found on the shelves of the family video stores in the state. For
example, take the videotape]{.font4} [Thelma and Louise]{.font4}[, which
last week was rated No. 1 in the country on the]{.font4}
[Billboard]{.font4} [charts.]{.font4} [Thelma and Louise]{.font4}
[contains sexually explicit scenes, in some of which women are portrayed
in positions of sexual submission, which is language taken directly from
the statute, and others in scenarios of degradation or
humiliation---again, language from the statute. Therefore, one could
argue that]{.font4} [Thelma and Louise]{.font4} [would be actionable
under H5194, despite the fact that critics have generally praised the
film.]{.font4} [Thelma and Louise]{.font4} [would be a problem under
H5194 because movies in which women are treated in a disapproved manner,
as sexually submissive, are unlawful no matter how significant the
literary, artistic, or political value of the work taken as a
whole.]{.font4}

[Certainly the proponents of this legislation will argue that they do
not intend that a movie like]{.font4} [Thelma and Louise]{.font4}
[should fall in the net of works proscribed by this bill, but
unfortunately if H5194 becomes law, video dealers in the state of
Massachusetts will not be in the position to make fine distinctions.
They will be faced with the prospect of huge liability judgments should
it turn out that they mistakenly stocked an item that was later to be
found an example of pornographic sex discrimination under the highly
subjective standard of this bill. As a result, they will be forced to
remove from their shelves all material containing sexually explicit
scenes, including many mainstream Hollywood movies, as Ms. Markels just
suggested. We do not believe that this is what members of the Committee
had in mind, and we therefore urge you to oppose this radical, absurd
and dangerous piece of legislation.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[question concerning]{.font4} [Silence of
the Lambs]{.font4} [and women's participation in such films\]]{.font4}

[KARPEL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The reality of this bill, when you look at the
coercion segment of this bill, is it tortures the meaning of the word
coercion. There are so many exceptions under the bill as to what
constitutes coercion that there is absolutely no defense against someone
who would be sued in this, that what they did was not coercion. There is
no way to defend yourself under this bill against the charge that what
you did was coercion. I mean there are so many exceptions to possible
defenses. Although that part of the bill doesn't apply to video
\[stores\]. We're more concerned with trafficking. We're more concerned
with what happens if this bill passes, some of our members get sued,
they're brought into court, and at that point, it's not going to be up
to the proponents of this bill to define what the term "sexually
explicit" means. It's going to be up to a judge. It's not going to be up
to the proponents or this judge to bring action. It's going to be up to
anyone, anyone who can claim damage on the part of another woman.
Actually, one thing we haven't discussed in this bill---it also applies
to men, children and transsexuals, so it applies to anyone, anywhere,
who feels that someone somewhere was damaged by a videotape or a book or
some other type of material that can be claimed to be sexually explicit,
\[inaudible discussion\]]{.font4}

[KARPEL:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I think it is easy to go after the behavior,
and not some kind of speech that is pretended to cause the behavior, or
it is claimed it caused the behavior. I think there are laws that exist
to go after that.]{.font4}

[LIERRE KEITH:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Lierre Keith. I live in
Northampton and I do educational slide shows about pornography and
violence against women. I want to talk first about my own victimization,
and the role of pornography in that, and then briefly about my
educational work.]{.font4}

[My brother started sexually abusing me when I was 4 or 5, and
pornography was part of the abuse. To be specific, he would describe a
certain pose that he'd seen in]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [or]{.font4}
[Penthouse,]{.font4} [and he'd make me do it. Often he would compare my
body to the pictures in a very detailed and graphic and humiliating way.
He also became obsessed with a feature they have in]{.font4}
[Hustler.]{.font4} [He told me it was called The Beaver Hunt, and men
could send in photographs of their wives and their girlfriends. And
indeed]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4} [still has The Beaver Hunt every
month. I have an example of it in my slide show. He thought this was the
greatest thing, that he could be a pornographer too, so he made me pose
for The Beaver Hunt and took pictures.]{.font4}

[Women who are sexually abused as children live through a certain kind
of hell. We're forced, we're manipulated through shame and guilt, our
bodies are used, we're humiliated and we're silenced. And then we're
told we wanted this. Especially we're told by the pornographers. We're
told that we were active participants somehow. We deserve Purple Hearts
for what we've been through, and all we get is more
pornography.]{.font4}

[When I was 15, my boyfriend tried to kill me. He came to my house after
we'd broken up and he tried to strangle me. I had bruises up and down my
neck the next day. I'm alive because I fought for my life. He told me
later that he wanted to kill me, that he brought a pair of scissors so
he could stab out my eyes, that he wanted to have sex with my dead body,
and then he was going to chop up my body and smear my blood on the
walls. And he said that he'd seen it. At 15, I wasn't sure what he
meant. Later, when I became a feminist, I came to learn that there are
snuff films, where a woman is really killed for sexual pleasure. Now
even in]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [and]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4}
[and]{.font4} [Hustler]{.font4}[; there are plenty of examples of death
as an erotic experience, so I don't know specifically what it was that
Dave saw---I didn't ask. The thing I hate most about this story is that
if he had succeeded, my 10-year-old sister would have been the next one
home.]{.font4}

[Now, doing my slide show, I've heard enough stories to last a lifetime.
An Asian-American woman who was raped, not once but twice. And both of
her assailants told her about pornography they'd seen of Asian women.
And lots of stories from incest survivors and battered women of being
shown pornography and then forced to perform what was in it. The story
of a teenage girl raped by one of her classmates, one of his friends
made a video and then they had a party where they showed the video. I've
also met a woman who was forced as a child to participate in making a
snuff film, where another little girl was really murdered, and it was
filmed. Now this happened in Massachusetts. This is happening in America
right now. The murder of real women is being sold as sexual
entertainment, and it could have been me. It could have been my body
chopped to pieces, and it could have been my 10-year-old sister, with
that horror formed forever in her brain.]{.font4}

[Now either my life matters or it doesn't. You have the power to do
something about this. I'm asking you to use it. Thank you.]{.font4}

[NANCY RYAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Nancy Ryan. I am the executive
director of the Women's Commission for the city of Cambridge, and I'm
also one of the founding members of the Feminist Anti-Censorship
Taskforce, which formed in Cambridge in 1985 because a bill almost
identical to this was introduced in the city of Cambridge, and when the
City Council decided not to pass it, it was placed on a referendum and
it was defeated. I learned a lot from that effort, and I've learned a
lot from the women who spoke here today, and I want to emphasize to you
that I oppose this bill for reasons that are clearer to me than they
ever were. The man who did these violent acts would have done them with
or without pornography. Violence against women existed long before
pornography. Exploitation of women is an economic fact of the society in
which we live. Women's humiliation begins with our second-class
citizenship in this society, and pornography is one of its symbols. I
don't believe that in this case we can deal with the problem by going at
the symbols.]{.font4}

[I want to say just a few things about the facts of the situation we
have with this bill. It distresses me that women's civil rights are
being protected by people like former Mayor Hudnut, who when he was a
member of Congress was against choice,^1 ^by representatives of the
Meese Commission, when Edwin Meese has fought against everything that
women have tried to achieve in this society, and other influences from
the right wing.]{.font4}

[[1. William Hudnut has always supported a woman's right to choose an
abortion.]{.sgc-4}\
]{.font4}

[It's very important to women that we have had a constitution which
protected our right to free speech and our right to privacy. Those are
the protections that have enabled us to gain what we have gained today.
It is not possible for me to support an effort against violence against
women which jeopardizes our capacity to continue to fight for women's
rights.]{.font4}

[I believe desperately in the fight against violence against women. Like
the woman who spoke just before me, I do a slide show in Cambridge
Public Schools on images of women. Next week, in Cambridge Rindge and
Latin School, we're going to have a video on images of women which will
be shown to the entire school. We have a Dating Violence Intervention
Project, which goes from classroom to classroom and talks with kids
about respect between men and women. These are the efforts that I
believe we have to take, along with picketing and screaming out loud
about every violent image of women that's produced in our society,
whether it's in mainstream movies or underground pornography. But I
believe our responsibility is to scream and yell and to get our
neighbors to scream and yell and tell people, march with your pocketbook
and march with your mouths, but I don't think we can risk the assault
that we're facing right now on our constitutional rights as women by
aligning with a group of people who would limit those rights even
more.]{.font4}

[I urge you to find other ways to deal with violence against women. As a
previous speaker said, our governor is taking away all of our monies for
battered women's services. Our rape crisis centers have been cut
dramatically in the last two years. Restore those funds, give us local
capacity to fight violence against women. I urge you to take that route.
Thank you for allowing me to speak.]{.font4}

Martinez?]{.font4}

[CLAUDIA MARTINEZ:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is
Claudia Martinez and I'm a resident of Somerville. I'm in my last year
as a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School and I will graduate in
June with a Master's in Divinity. I also work part-time as an
administrative assistant for the Dean's Office at Radcliffe College.
Prior to my work as a graduate student, I was promotion manager for
several radio and television stations in the country, as well as for a
national publication. I come before the Committee today as a concerned
citizen, anxious to stop the exploitation of women and young girls and
young boys.]{.font4}

[I am in a unique position to talk about the pain that being a part of
pornography brings. Between 1959 and 1964, I lived a very schizophrenic
existence. I was one of several stars, if you will, at a porno studio
where live sex acts between children and women and animals were enjoyed
by a largely male audience. Other times of my life were spent in my
middle-class home, going to school, taking piano lessons and attending
choir practice at my church.]{.font4}

[The porno studio that I was subjected to was filled with evil and pain
for me. I was humiliated and repeatedly raped. I was forced to perform
fellatio on patrons in the bleachers in the audience. I was forced to
smile as animals hurt my body. Other children were not as fortunate as I
was. After a night of ridicule, my father would take me home. I knew
many children who lived in a trailer behind the studio. Many of them had
been runaways and they were locked into the trailer to prevent their
running again. Their search for something better in this life ended in a
smoky tavern filled with drunken laughter.]{.font4}

[I understand that pornography has changed with the advent of video, but
the intent and the pain that it causes has not. Children do not usually
pose for long periods in front of crowds of screaming men anymore, but
the transmission of their self and their image has haunting effects that
last forever. The coercion that is perpetrated on them, the
brainwashing---children with diminished self-esteem usually grow into
prostitutes, drug abusers, alcoholics, child abusers. They hate
themselves and many times turn that hatred out toward society.
Pornography kills the souls of so many, not only the soul of the child,
but the soul of those who would exploit others in order to feel more
powerful.]{.font4}

[The effects of this child abuse upon me was devastating. I remember
being a little eight-year-old girl with no need for a training bra. My
nipples and my genitalia were often rouged to copy the styles of older
women in porno magazines. The dogs I was subjected to were the
inspiration of the owners who had read about the animals in pornographic
novels. I saw very little boys and girls who were handcuffed to posts.
In my early twenties, I was extremely promiscuous and frequented porno
parlors for fun.]{.font4}

[And I'd be silent about the abuse I lived with. Although my abuse
happened in another state, over thirty years ago, it does not mean that
the degradation of pornography does not continue. Children are still
forced into the same positions that I was. I was not only a victim of
extreme assault upon my body, but I was occasionally subjected to
viewing the violence perpetrated on other children. I was raped by men,
I was raped by animals, and I was raped by other children who were
coerced into raping me. I speak not only for myself, but I want to
remember the children who died in these conditions---children whose
parents never cared, children who are buried across this country that
we'll never know about, \[end of tape; break in recording\]]{.font4}

[DANIEL CHARTRAND:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I'm Daniel Chartrand. I'm the former

currently a board member of the American Bookseller's Foundation for
Free Expression. I'm also currently a bookseller and I'm a resident of
the Brighton district of Boston, Massachusetts.]{.font4}

[I'm urging you to reject House Bill 5194 because H5194 would force the
suppression of books that are protected by the First Amendment.]{.font4}

[This bill would punish publishers and booksellers for producing and
distributing works that they have a constitutional right to disseminate.
The U. S. Supreme Court has ruled that the states may regulate only
material that is obscene or child pornography, according to its
guidelines. The definition of pornography in this bill clearly applies
to a wide range of mainstream works, including art and photography books
and novels by mainstream authors whose general and local acceptance is
proved by their appearance on national and regional bestseller lists. In
order to protect themselves from suits, publishers and booksellers would
need to discontinue the sale of nearly all materials with any sexual
content.]{.font4}

[I'd just like to go a little further and mention that, in response to
Ms. MacKinnon's testimony, booksellers are not in league with
pornographers in appealing legislation like the Indianapolis bill.
Booksellers are not in favor of sexual violence in pornography. They
are, however, against the chilling effects that legislation such as this
bill would effect.]{.font4}

[I'm also going to quote from an editorial that appeared in the]{.font4}
[Rocky Mountain News]{.font4} [by the president of the American
Booksellers Association. This was in response to national legislation on
this issue, but it applies to this as well. She ends her editorial by
saying, "The Pornography Victims Compensation Act turns upside down the
relationship between the booksellers and their customers that has been
established by the First Amendment. It is not the booksellers' job to
tell people what books they may buy. The First Amendment protects the
right of the reader to make those choices for him or herself. "]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Is Jackson Katz here?]{.font4}

[JACKSON KATZ:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is
Jackson Katz, and I'm the founder of a group called Real Men, which is
an anti-sexist men's group. The purpose of our group is to get men to
start taking responsibility for the outrageous level of sexism and
sexual harassment and sexual violence and all forms of violence against
women in society. I'm also a graduate student at the Harvard Graduate
School of Education.]{.font4}

[I'm supporting this bill because I think, as Professor MacKinnon said
earlier, one of the effects of this bill would be to bring this subject
into the light. What I think we've heard today from numerous women, some
really compelling testimony about how pornography has harmed
them.]{.font4}

[One thing that we really haven't delved into is how men are affected by
pornography, that is, men who are the consumers of pornography and what
that does to the way that we deal with women. I think our
genera]{.font4}[tion has grown up with more pornography than any
generation in human history, and it's an absolutely central aspect of
the conditioning of young boys. It's hard to overstate how important
pornography has been in the past twenty-five years in terms of my
generation and young boys who are growing up today. That's where they're
learning about sex, and that's where they're learning about women, in
many ways through pornography.]{.sgc-2}

[There's a professor of psychology at UMass Boston who has done his
doctoral dissertation and subsequent research on sexual aggression among
young college males, and he's found that in dozens and dozens of
interviews that young guys will sit there in a room with him, and
they'll admit to or just talk matter-of-factly about, "I did this to
her, I did that, and then we did this and that, " and they never once
refer to themselves as rapists, of course, and they never once refer to
the behavior that they've engaged in as raping behavior, or in any way
criminal. But this psychologist will tell you that he knows that if they
were under oath in the court of law, they would be admitting to first
degree felonies, but they think it's normal, perfectly natural
heterosexual relations.]{.font4}

[I travel around the country and speak to college audiences, both male
and female, and mixed audiences, and one thing I find over and over
again, in frank discussions, is that pornography is extremely
influential in the lives of young boys growing up today, and girls, but
specifically I speak to guys. Again, I can't overstate how important it
is in conditioning young boys. This blizzard of images of women in
degrading and humiliating positions, guys just come to think of that as
normal.]{.font4}

[There was an article in the]{.font4} [New York Times]{.font4} [last
week about sexual harassment in schools, how there's a whole new area of
litigation that's opening up with young girls who are sexually harassed.
If you read that article on the front page of the]{.font4}
[Times]{.font4} [last week, you'll find that guys are saying that they
don't know what to do, what they can do and what they can't do, what's
acceptable and what isn't acceptable. As I read that, I said to myself,
it's obvious where they're learning on one level what is and what isn't
acceptable. In other words, you could take some of the dialogue out of
these kids' mouths right out of a discussion of pornography that I've
had on numerous occasions.]{.font4}

[Pornography is a subtext to relations between the sexes, young boys and
young girls today. That's why my group supports this bill.]{.font4}

[There's another group in Boston called Men to End Sexual Assault, and
they support this bill. Many men who work in this field, who
work ]{.font4}[with young boys and who work with men to try to work
against sexism and violence against women, will tell you that
pornography is an extremely important issue. And that's why I'm
supporting the bill.]{.sgc-2}

[BOB CHATELLE:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Hi, I'm Bob Chatelle. I'm a fiction
writer. I won't say poor fiction writer, that would be redundant. I live
near Central Square in Cambridge, I'm a delegate of UAW Local 1981, the
National Writer's Union, and a Boston local steering committee
member.]{.font4}

[I oppose H5194, misnamed An Act to Protect the Civil Rights of Women
and Children. Pornography comprises expressive work wherein depictions
of sexual activity predominate, and whose primary intent is to arouse
sexually the readers or viewers. Some pornography, as we've heard, is
ugly, vile and offensive. Some pornography is imaginative and beautiful.
No clear boundary separates pornography from art. The notion that
pornography causes crime contradicts the premises of a free and
democratic society. That is, adults have free will, actions are based on
information, error should be challenged in the free market of
ideas.]{.font4}

[Citizens are free to make their own decisions, even terrible decisions,
and those who commit violence shall be held fully responsible before the
law. I can think of no idea that more opposes the ideals of our nation's
founders than the notion that it's all right to suppress a book because
someone reading it might commit a crime. Why not ban the books of Dr.
James Dobson---he's the leading anti-porn crusader who claims that
pornography motivated Ted Bundy. Why not ban Agatha Christie? What about
the Bible, which sick minds have used for centuries to justify countless
atrocities?]{.font4}

[As a writer, I insist upon my right to explore the entire realm of
human experience, including sexuality. As a gay writer, I am especially
concerned. In Canada, where there is no First Amendment, and where
Professor MacKinnon has advanced her procensorship agenda, the usual
censorship victims are gay and lesbian writers, journalists,
bookstores.]{.font4}

[Sexual abuse and harassment must not be tolerated, women must achieve
their fair share of freedom and power. But H5194 does nothing for women,
children or anyone else. I ask you to give it an adverse report. Thank
you for your time and consideration.]{.font4}

[SUZANNE FULLER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Suzanne Fuller. I live in
Northampton, Massachusetts.]{.font4}

[The first incident I'd like to talk about is representative of many
incidents that I experienced by the man that abused me for years. This
man was an avid user of pornography:]{.font4}
[Penthouse]{.font4}[,]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4}[; pornographic videos,
strip ba]{.font4}[s,]{.sgc-2}[r and 1-900 sex calls. He came home after
being out all night at strip bars, and he wanted intercourse. I was very
frightened from past times that he had forced me. As he was on top of me
and inside of me, he called me a "cunt, a whore. " He repeated over and
over again as he grabbed at me and slapped me, "Come on, you fucking
cunt, I know you love my cock. " I was crying and pleading for him to
stop. I tried to get away from him. He beat me as he tried to tie me up
to the bed with sheets. "I'm going to fuck you to death, " he would say.
He had me face down and forced his penis in my anus. I escaped for a
moment to the corner of the room, scrunched down, naked, beaten. Fearing
for my life, I screamed for help. Beating and kicking me, he forced his
penis in my face, saying that if I did not suck on him, he would kill
me.]{.sgc-2}

[He forced me to watch porn flicks, insisting that I should like them,
learn from them, and be like those women, so I could please him. He
would always be forceful during intercourse after viewing these porn
videos. He insisted that I repeat what the women did, as he repeated
what the man did. He would hit me as he forced me. I felt humiliated,
terrified. I was his sex slave. He showed me a picture of a woman, it
was either from]{.font4} [Penthouse]{.font4} [or]{.font4}
[Playboy]{.font4}[, and he said that he believed that she was me. Later,
he told me that his deepest fantasy was to rape me, which he did
repeatedly. After an unwanted visit from him, when he was abusive and
once again insistent on sexual acts, I discovered later when receiving
my phone bill, that prior to the abuse, he had made many phone calls to
the 1-900 sex calls that he had \[seen\] in the]{.font4} [Valley
Advocate.]{.font4}

[In addition, this man has also been harassing other women. One night,
after watching a porn video at his friend's house, he called the woman
next door, and insisted that she go outside the house naked and perform
sexual acts so he could watch. He told her that if she did not do this,
he would kill her and her children. He was eventually found guilty for
this incident.]{.font4}

[It is very apparent to me the direct correlation of the use of
pornography and the abuse that I survived. Today I am grateful to be
alive. The extreme abuse I suffered was exaggerated and learned through
the use of pornography.]{.font4}

[JOHN SWOMLEY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Good afternoon, my name is John Swomley.
I've submitted some testimony as a co-chair of the Boston Coalition for
Freedom of Expression, an artists organization that is opposed to
censorship. I'm also a criminal defense lawyer.]{.font4}

[Much of what I have to say\... has already been spoken to and
addressed. But what I would like to point out, what has been
systematically going on here in this Committee, is that you've heard
from Ms. MacKinnon and you've heard from even Representative Hildt about
certain statistics that show that there is a rising amount of
pornography and there's a rising percentage of violent crime against
women. They leave the statistical realm at that point in time and rely
on empirical evidence which they have paraded here. One witness after
another after another. They talk about the wealth of statistical
analysis that can support their theories, and yet they don't provide any
here before the Committee. Now, one of the few statistics that I've seen
on the percentage of violent pornography comes from the Meese
Commission, and their own study showed. 6 percent of the major sexually
explicit material contained acts of violence. And they relied upon a
Canadian study, which said 10 percent. Now, the definition that the
proponents of this bill have relied upon is a definition exclusively of
violence. And, at best, they have a 10 percent figure for that. Now,
what they try and do then is go from that figure to a causal link to
violence against women generally.]{.font4}

[Now, I can only testify as to my empirical history and that is as a
criminal defense lawyer in Brooklyn, New York, for the last four years,
and I've represented hundreds of abusers, people who have committed
horrible acts against women, from rape all the way down to verbal
assault, and none of that involved pornography. What that doesn't do is
tell you that there is or isn't a link. It just shows that you can
produce anyone to say anything.]{.font4}

[Essentially, when you get to the issue of causation, you have to
decide, is the violent act predicated upon the pornography? That is,
without the pornography, would there be a violent act? And I think it's
preposterous to think that it wouldn't be. I mean, when you use Ted
Bundy as an example, would he have committed the acts against women that
he ultimately was executed for doing without the pornography? And I
think you'd have to say, yes, he would. None of the evidence that has
been shown here today counters that, and there's no evidence offered to
you--- scientific, sociological or otherwise---to say there is a link
between violent pornography and violence against women. There are far
more effective ways to address that problem: social programs. Thank
you.]{.font4}

[ANN RUSSO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Ann Russo, and I've been
teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the last five
years. I teach a course on violence against women in contemporary U. S.
society. I have researched and written extensively on issues
particularly of sexual violence, and particularly in terms of the
connection between the production of that violence and the production
and consumption of pornography. I wrote my doctoral dissertation on
pornography and the linkages with sexual violence, particularly
exploring this civil rights approach to pornography embodied in the bill
that is before you today.]{.font4}

[From my research and investigation, I believe this civil rights
approach most directly addresses the specific harms of pornography to
women and children, and men where applicable. That is, it addresses how
pornography actively discriminates against women, in its production,
consumption and distribution.]{.font4}

[For my testimony here today, I would like to specifically talk about
the information that I have as a teacher of a course on violence at M.
I. T. of the extensive use and functioning of pornography at M. I. T.
Many of the students in my class have come to me and told me about the
role of pornography in their particular abuse, many stories similar to
what you've heard today, but they also talk to me a lot about how
pornography is used in the particular educational environment at M. I.
T. as a result of it being shown in the common living spaces in the coed
dormitories, also, secondly, the way it is used in different labs and
worksites at M. I. T., and, thirdly, in terms of computer pornographic
harassment. I want to give a couple examples of these so you can see how
pornography functions to discriminate against women.]{.font4}

[But first I would like to say briefly what happens to women as a result
of these abuses---that women feel very diminished. It's already a
difficult environment to be at M. I. T. as a woman because traditionally
women have not been accepted there as legitimate scholars and students.
The existence of pornography further diminishes their self-esteem and
self-confidence. Some students I know have had to take time off, have
had to take a year off, have had to take two years off, because of
issues of sexual harassment and abuse at M. I. T. Many of them have had
great difficulty in concentrating on their school work and jobs. Many
have been silenced in talking about it because they are immediately
harassed for speaking out against it.]{.font4}

[One example is in the dorms, where despite requests by women students
that pornographic films not be shown in common living rooms, some male
students insisted on their right to show the films. In two cases, a male
student insisted on showing]{.font4} [Deep Throat,]{.font4} [a film
which presents Linda "Lovelace" Marchiano, who we talked about earlier
today, despite women students in the dorm telling this particular man
that it was offensive to show]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4} [since it
has been documented in her books---]{.font4} [Ordeal]{.font4}
[and]{.font4} [Out of Bondage]{.font4}[---that she was tortured and
terrorized into. Secondly, they told him that at least one of the
students who was a resident of that dormitory had been throat-raped in
that particular way, and she felt particularly traumatized by the
showing of that film. Despite her efforts and other women's trying to
talk to him about showing the film, he showed it anyway to a whole group
of students from the dorm. As a result, she and other students lost
sleep, she lost a lot of school time. The one student was a doctoral
student, and felt extremely harassed. She tried to address this through
the M. I. T. administration and got nowhere because they still refuse to
take an active stance around pornography. And then she was further
harassed in that dormitory through threatening notes, etc., for trying
to stop the showing of that film.]{.font4}

[I would like to talk briefly about two other instances because I think
they're important. These apply to the forcing provision. A number of
instances have occurred at M. I. T. in labs where pornographic pictures
are displayed, and there are only one or two women in the lab. When the
women complain about it, instead of taking the pornography down, the
response has often been defensiveness, anger and more pornography has
been put up. That's an example of force. Another example is the computer
pornography where the students are trying to write their papers in
computer networks and they'll have pornography right next to them being
shown on the screen, and again making it difficult for them to do their
work.]{.font4}

[I want to end by saying I really believe that pornography silences
women and that this bill gives women a voice to seek redress.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [\[inaudible question regarding MIT's response
to this\]]{.font4}

[RUSSO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Right. There were attempts to deal with it. In
the case of the]{.font4} [Deep Throat]{.font4} [situation, what they did
was they sort of railroaded the student, even though they had a
policy.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They allow X-rated films to be shown in the
dormitories?]{.font4} 

[RUSSO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They supposedly had a policy against it, but
they don't enforce it because they're afraid that they're going to get a
lawsuit against them. So they shuttled the student from one office to
the next.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Who is they? The administration?]{.font4}

[RUSSO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [The administration, yes. It's been an ongoing
issue at M. I. T. because there was a tradition at M. I. T. to show
pornography as part of registration and orientation day, until about ten
years ago, and it's because of protests, which have been met with other
protests saying that it's a breach of freedom of speech that they have a
right to show pornography on that particular day.]{.font4}

[POLUMBO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [So they allow it to be shown?]{.font4}

[RUSSO:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [They don't allow it but they don't totally
enforce their policy against it. They'll encourage it\....]{.font4}

[BETSY WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Betsy Warrior, and I'm
founder of the Battered Women's Directory, which is a national and
international resource for battered women describing services that they
can get all over the world. I'm also the author of]{.font4} [Battered
Women\'s Directory.]{.font4} [But more importantly, for the last fifteen
years, I've run a support group for battered women and have trained many
others to facilitate support groups for battered women to escape abusive
situations or help resolve the relationships that they are in.]{.font4}

[I'm here today to tell you that out of the hundreds and hundreds of
women that have come through these groups over the last fifteen years,
many have had partners who were pornography consumers and who used
pornography as a mere instruction manual, in some cases to dictate the
kinds of abuse inflicted on their wives and their girlfriends. For
others, it seemed to be a goad to initiate or intensify abusive patterns
of behavior against women. This includes all degrees of abuse, from
disparaging, demeaning and degrading attitudes to outright attempts at
murder, and that is just a small part of it. I've heard of many, many
cases of attempted murder, and in some cases the completion of murder,
that has been enacted through using pornography.]{.font4}

[I think pornography needs to be considered as hate literature, and hate
literature with criminal intent to deprive women of their civil and
their legal rights to cause discrimination and harassment. Pornography
is not an instrument of free speech, but an instrument employed to abuse
women and humiliate them into silence. Therefore, I think laws should be
designed to curb the appalling impact this hate material has on the
lives of women. Therefore, I support the legislation being proposed
here. Thank you. If you have any questions---]{.font4}

[\[inaudible\]]{.font4}

[WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes, some of the women, in fact, that have
come through my group, testified here today.]{.font4}

[\[UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE\]:]{.font3 .sgc-1}
[\[inaudible\]]{.font4}

[WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Many cases the police won't take seriously
because there are no laws on the books like the law that is being
proposed here today.]{.font4}

[\[UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE\]:]{.font3 .sgc-1} [\[What about murder?
\]]{.font4}

[WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [In some cases yes, and in some cases no. They
will just let the thing lapse until they say there isn't enough evidence
to pursue any perpetrator.]{.font4}

[\[Question on whether any of the women sought restraining orders.
\]]{.font4} 

[WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Many, many of them have gotten restraining
orders---a good number of them, probably over 50 percent, maybe 60
percent, I would say. A man who testified earlier today who defended
people who were rapists, etc., said that nobody gave any statistics
here. It might be anecdotal, but coming through the support group, I'd
say probably 60 percent or more women explicitly state that their
abusive relationships and lives were affected in some way by
pornography---to heighten or intensify or to initiate.]{.font4}

[\[UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE\]:]{.font3 .sgc-1}
[\[inaudible\]]{.font4}

[WARRIOR:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Oh, all relationships, even in some cases
where stepfathers or boyfriends or husbands also abused the children,
pornography was sometimes a factor in those cases as well.]{.font4}

[JEAN M. MORAN:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Jean Moran. I'm currently a
graduate student in nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. During my sophomore year living at a dormitory at M. I.
T., I was forced to deal with not only how pornography affected women's
lives in general, but how it affected my life as well. In December of
1988, some residents decided to throw a bachelor's party for one of the
residents. This included beer and pornography videos being shown in one
of the common areas of the dormitory. For the pornography viewing, a
door was pulled closed and secured. No signs were posted. Doors to the
lounge from the stairwell were also closed. Again, no signs were posted.
Despite the closed doors, women on the third floor were able to hear the
video. When I found out right after, I became outraged. I felt violated.
I felt unsafe. I went to the third floor and was even more disturbed to
find one of the three graduate residents of the dorm still in the
lounge. This magnified all of my earlier feelings of outrage and
distress. Whom could I trust? The showing of pornography had been at the
very least condoned and viewed by a figure of authority in the dorm.
After this, the group decided to continue showing the pornography in one
of the resident's rooms.]{.font4}

[I was one of the few women who spoke out and attempted to explain to
men and women why pornography hurt me. Rumors spread quickly throughout
the dorm about me, and people I once considered friends gave me nasty
looks. While visiting a friend, I was verbally harassed by three men.
The same graduate resident who had been present at the pornography
showing silently watched me being driven to tears, reaffirming the men's
stance and their abusive treatment of me. A friend of mine was
threatened by the house president that she would have the lab partner
from hell if she did not quiet down and silence me. For about two weeks,
I was followed around the dorm by one of the men. He would be at most
two steps behind me, encroaching upon my feeling of personal space and
my sense of safety. He would wait for me outside of people's bedrooms
trying to listen to conversations, in places he was known not to
frequent. When the housemaster was made aware of the situation by a
friend, all of the proposed actions seemed unreasonable. It felt as if I
was only setting myself up for retaliation. After feeling the anger from
people while speaking out against pornography, I did not feel strong
enough to face more intimidation and harassment from my peers.]{.font4}

[The whole experience created a lot of pain, anger, fear, and tears in
me. It affected my schoolwork, and it's amazing I made it through the
semester and still made it through M. I. T. I can still feel all of
this. No one should feel uncomfortable in their own home. For these
reasons, I support the bill.]{.font4}

[BARRY SHUCHTER:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [My name is Barry Shuchter. I'm
representing a group, Men to End Sexual Assault, in this area. We are
writing in support of Bill 5194, an Act to Protect the Civil Rights of
Women and Children.]{.font4}

[Our group, Men to End Sexual Assault, has worked in the anti-rape
movement for six years as a project of the Boston Area Rape Crisis
Center. Through speaking engagements, workshops and public forums, we
encourage men to take responsibility toward ending violence against
women. We believe this responsibility includes learning to recognize the
harm that pornography causes to women, both in its production and its
consumption.]{.font4}

[While we encourage men to become more responsible in their personal
lives and relationships, that alone is not enough. It is also crucially
important to address the larger social and political realities of the
pornography industry that affect women as a group. We believe this bill
represents an important and necessary step toward correcting a major
imbalance in our society in which the rights of men to produce and view
pornography often diminish the rights of women to be free and safe on
the streets and in their homes. Attempts to just legislate or censor
pornography would not address this imbalance, it would just regulate
it.]{.font4}

[Only a civil rights approach such as this bill provides can give women
the legal tools they need to gain the power and self-protection that men
take for granted.]{.font4}

[We realize this issue is very complex, and we've given alternate points
of view due and lengthy consideration. Our conclusion is to strongly
urge you to adopt this bill as proposed. And it's signed by eleven men
from our group. Thank you.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Anyone else in favor or opposed to this
legislation 5194? Anyone else?]{.font4}

[JAYE MORRA:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Yes. I wanted to say I'm a senior at
Wheelock College in Boston, and I'm in favor of this bill.]{.font4}

[I was taking a class with Gail Dines, a professor at Wheelock College,
who has introduced me to feminism. And outside of that class, I have
done a lot of research on my own. I was very interested in the
pornography issue because I never realized how much it does affect me.
Like a woman who testified before, her boyfriend had said to her, when I
see this woman in the pictures, it's you. And I've realized that I'm no
different from any of these women in these magazines, and these guys who
are looking at these magazines, they don't know who these women are any
more than they know who I am.]{.font4}

[And when I have to walk down these streets in Boston, I have to be
scared for my life, because I know that the rape rate is so high. I've
been raped once before. I don't want to be raped again. I was raped at a
university, knowing that pornography runs rampant at that
university.]{.font4}

[I studied pornography for approximately 17 hours in two days, so that I
could do a lecture at Simmons College on the effects of pornography. I
titled it, "What Pornography Really Is, " because I feel that women do
not know what pornography really is because we're not meant to.
Pornography is meant for men. So it's about time that I went out and saw
what pornography really is, and informed women of what it really is. So
I did just that, and I found articles giving directions of how a guy
should take his girlfriend away for the weekend and all these things he
should do to her while they are away. I was reading through this, and
these things were absolutely torturous, giving men all kinds of ideas of
what they can do to their girlfriends, and how they can hit them where
the bruises won't be obvious to people, and torturous things such as not
letting her go to the bathroom and making her hold it for hours, and
hours, and hours, and when she finally can go, to make her go in a
litter box, and all these kinds of things.]{.font4}

[Then I decided to protest Video Expo, which is a pornography store that
opened up right near my college, and three women's colleges are
surrounding the store. A radio station, very popular with college men,
was giving away free adult videos to only fraternities in this area,
which really scared me, because I know that there are lots of rapes in
colleges and I know that there are lots of rapes filmed in colleges. So
I went on to protest, and I got a great response. And I feel like I have
to speak for a lot of women and a lot of college women to say that this
pornography that's surrounding me is really frightening. I think a bill
like this would give us the right to speak.]{.font4}

[Like someone said earlier, this bill shouldn't be passed because a
man]{.font4} [might]{.font4} [do danger to a woman, or might hurt a
woman. I think we have to realize, and it's been said before, that it's
not "might hurt a woman. " You have to hurt these women in order to make
this pornography. To have a woman hanging from a tree, like I've seen,
you have to actually hang her from a tree. So it's not what they might
be doing, it's what they]{.font4} [are]{.font4} [doing. And I think it's
about time that women get the right to speak.]{.font4}

[DiMASI:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [Thank you very much. Any questions? Anybody
else want to testify on this bill?]{.font4}

[DORIAN GREGORY:]{.font7 .sgc-1} [I don't know whether you'd call me a
statistic or an instance of empirical evidence, but I know I was hurt
because of pornography.]{.font4}

[My name is Dorian Gregory. I live in Northampton. When I was a child,
five or six years old, the boys in the neighborhood had pornography and
they sexually abused me. I do not know whether they found it in the
woods, or whether they got it from their homes. There were four or five,
sometimes six of them, and they ranged in age from 8 to 13. They did to
me what they saw in the pornography. The pornography told us what to do.
Mostly they saw naked women,]{.font4} [Playboy]{.font4} [or]{.font4}
[Penthouse]{.font4} [stuff, so they stripped me or convinced me to strip
myself. They also saw pictures of sexual intercourse, so this is what
they did to me. One after another, they took turns being the man in the
picture, and I was to lay there and be the woman.]{.font4}

[The cause of my abuse was pornography. The pictures that they had gave
them the ideas and told them what to do, and if it was in the picture,
it was the truth. And I thought that's what it meant to be a woman. And
I believe that with this law, we can begin to change what it means to be
a woman. Thank you.]{.font4}

[I just want to say briefly that I oppose this bill uncategorically for
three reasons. It's unconstitutional. It doesn't begin to address real
serious abuses in our society that need to be addressed. And, finally,
this bill is an egregious gift from the political left to the political
right, which is pursuing censorship nationwide.]{.font4}

[The following testimony contains descriptions of incidents which
occurred over a period of eight years in which I worked as a prostitute,
dancer and nude model. I choose to remain anonymous because the negative
stigma of being a prostitute could harm my present career, family and
friends.]{.font4}

[As a prostitute I worked in massage parlours, peep shows, private
apartments, street corners, bars and for escort services. I worked in
most major cities across the country. In all of these cities, wherever
pornography is being sold, that is where prostitutes work. We did not
choose to work in these places but would get arrested or thrown out of
hotels or bars if they were not in the so called red light district. The
prostitutes I knew who were African American or Latin\[a\] had even less
options because many places would not hire them and police would bust
them if they strayed out of a certain area. Once I had been arrested for
prostitution and nudity and obscenity I had no more civil rights. When I
was mistreated by a customer, club owner or hotel security, I could not
go to the police because they would arrest me or ignore me.]{.font4}

[At the age of seventeen I began dancing in topless and bottomless bars.
I was working for a pimp and was under a lot of pressure from him and
the club owners to make a lot of money. In these bars they had
pornographic videos playing constantly which contained graphic scenes of
various sexual acts. The women in the videos were usually naked and the
men were often clothed except for their penis. One movie showed a woman
with three men, one on top of her having intercourse, one pushing his
penis in her mouth and one rubbing his penis on her breast. I had never
seen pornographic movies before. I soon found out that in order to make
tips I had to lay on the dance floor, spread my legs and expose
my ]{.font4}[genitals to the customers, just like in the videos. I had
to simulate postures such as being on my hands and knees and arching my
back as if being entered from behind by a penis. I had to look at the
customers and stick out my tongue as if performing oral sex. This was
all extremely degrading.]{.sgc-5}

[A co-worker talked me into doing a photo session with a photographer
she knew. She showed me a spread she had done for Penthouse magazine
which she said he had shot. I later found out she got a finders fee for
bringing me to him. I had to sign a release form which said I would only
be paid a certain amount if a photo was sold to a magazine. I was told
to wear red nail polish and cover my genitals with red lipstick. The
photographer told me to suck in my stomach even though I was very slim.
The most humiliating part was when the photographer told me to spread my
legs as wide as I could and look right at the camera making facial
expressions depicting arousal while masturbating with a pearl necklace
or pushing my breasts together with my hands. One photograph that I know
of from this shoot was sold to a magazine. It was a shot of me on my
hands and knees, my buttocks facing the camera and spread so that my
genitals were exposed while I peeked over my shoulder so that my face
was very recognizable. This appeared on the back of High Society
magazine as an ad for back issues for twelve months straight. I do not
know what happened to the other photographs. I remember being afraid
that a relative would see that picture.]{.font4}

[The first massage parlour I ever worked in I had to dance topless in
the lounge which I did not get paid for, as well as service customers. I
was still seventeen and very naive. One day someone was taking pictures
of me. The next thing I knew, a picture of me clothed only in a G
string, was on a flyer advertising this massage parlour and being handed
out on every corner. I did not give permission for that photo to be used
but could not do anything about it. Shortly afterwards I got into an
argument with the owner over a racist comment he made and he punched me
in the face, took all my money and threw me down some stairs.]{.font4}

[The massage parlours and private houses I worked in all had
pornographic videos available for the customers, either in the bedrooms
or in the waiting room. A lot of my work consisted of acting out
particular scenes for the customer which caused him to become aroused.
If a customer was into real hard core movies in which women were tied
up, whipped, raped, urinated on etc., then he would want me to act out
that kind of scene. On several occasions a customer requested that I act
like I was his daughter and he would then rape me while I screamed "No
Daddy, please don't, I'm so scared" and so on. I had several life
threatening experiences with customers who were into violent fantasies.
A very wealthy man lured me into his private house by offering me a
large sum of money which I needed at the time. He locked me into his
bedroom and after throwing some money at me he threw me face down on the
bed and tore off my clothes. He choked me until I almost passed out and
said he would kill me if I didn't do what he said. He jammed his fist up
my rectum and smeared my own feces all over my body while he masturbated
and made me say things like my cunt was hot for him. When he achieved
orgasm he ejaculated in my hair and all over my body. When I got back
out on the street I had no one to go to for help even though I had been
raped and violated in the worst way.]{.font4}

[Some of the most violent pornography that I saw was in the houses of
customers that I saw through escort services. Sometimes they had
magazines with women being gang raped, urinated on, defecated on and
being penetrated with inhuman objects like scissors. A lot of times
these men were high on cocaine or other drugs and would watch
pornographic films for hours and hours while having sex with one woman
after another. I considered the men who were into pornography to be the
most dangerous and potentially violent since that is what aroused them.
One time a customer took out a heavy leather belt and started beating me
across the stomach and breasts. He was into pornography which showed
young girls tying each other up and whipping each other. I tried to
remain calm and keep it like a game even though I was in a great deal of
pain. I convinced him to reverse roles and let me whip him instead. I
had large purple bruises on my body the next day.]{.font4}

[At least fifty percent of the men that I saw professionally were into
fantasies and pornography such as I have described. They were men from
all over the world and all types of professions. Every prostitute I know
has had similar experiences. Often we keep it to ourselves because it is
very painful to remember. I have been scarred for life both mentally and
physically. I have violent nightmares on a regular basis which replay my
worst experiences of sexual violence over and over. I have difficulty
relating to people in normal social situations. I cannot make love with
someone without having flashbacks of being a prostitute. I have very
little self confidence. I especially support this bill because it
includes a set of conditions including prostitution which cannot
disprove coercion and therefore gives me rights which I did not have
before.]{.font4}

[Dear Representative DiMasi:]{.font4}

[This letter is to lend our strongest possible support to HB5194, an act
designed to ensure and protect the civil rights of women and children in
this Commonwealth. At the Cambridge Hospital Victims of Violence

number of women whose victimization by physical and sexual violence was
preceded in childhood and/or accompanied in adolescence and adulthood by
the violent, exploitive and anti-erotic images being proffered on the
American public by a pornography industry that knows no bounds and
accepts no responsibility. Please give Massachusetts women and children
the right to claim and prove harm.]{.font4}

Cloherty, March 12, 1992, Boston, Massachusetts]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[Working as a woman in a non-traditional job (union carpentry) I have
encountered many covert and overt aggressions. Pornography on a job site
is one of the more blatant ways a woman is told that "this is a male
domain; " "Go Away. "]{.font4}

[Sometimes I am sent to a job and (gratefully! ) the men have been
advised]{.font4} [beforehand]{.font4} [to remove the porno shots from
the elevator or the tool shack or whatever common areas we may share.
Sometimes not.]{.font4}

[When I was working on the Mass. Avenue Bridge (the]{.font4}
[only]{.font4} [female on the bridge) I was in an environment which was
exceptionally hostile. All the crew shared a common table saw which was
placed in a central location. Periodically one or more of the carpenters
would use the saw and then return to the area on the bridge where they
were working. When I approached the table saw one day the whole crew
became, quiet and watched me. Nailed to the table directly in front of
the saw was a playing card. The "playing card" was an explicit close up
of female genitalia with a large 16 penny nail (this is basically a
SPIKE) nailed into the vagina. When I saw it some of my coworkers
started snickering and laughing.]{.font4}

[After viewing this, I found myself feeling depressed. Did I set myself
up for this humiliation?]{.font4} [Why]{.font4} [was I working in this
field?, etc. Questions which provoked a sense of]{.font4}
[personal]{.font4} [responsibility for]{.font4} [their]{.font4}
[hostility.]{.font4}

[Ultimately, I seized the porno card and ripped it into pieces and
dropped it into the river. What would tomorrow be like, I
wondered.]{.font4}

[The hostile environment is real, damaging and effective in repelling
women. I fully support passage of legislation which would protect
workers from such blatant harassment.]{.font4}

[]{#massWrittenSubmissions.xhtml#bookmark4}[Submission of Kathleen
O'Neill Alexander, March 16, 1992, Boston, Massachusetts]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[Members of the Judiciary Committee:]{.font4}

[My name is Kathleen O'Neill Alexander. I reside\... in Northampton. I
have been a rape crisis program coordinator and counselor at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. I also taught a course there for
six years entitled: Violence Against Women: A Multi-cultural,
Multiracial Perspective. I have been program coordinator of Daybreak,
Inc., a shelter for battered women and children in Worcester. I have
been involved with the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault since
1983. And I am the author of]{.font4} [Reclaiming Our Lives: A Handbook
for Rape Crisis Counselors and Educators in Massachusetts.]{.font4}
[Over the last ten years I have committed myself to working on behalf of
victims of violence. Presently, I am the Director of the Victim Witness
Assistance Program in the Northwestern District Attorney's Office. I
have had the privilege to work with District Attorney Judd J. Carhart
for the last three years serving the people of Hampshire and Franklin
counties.]{.font4}

[I regret that due to court responsibilities I must have someone else
read my testimony.]{.font4}

[I know the impact and violence of pornography first hand. I am a strong
and confident woman who is still haunted by the violent images and
degradation that pornography has had on my life. I was a serious
Irish-Catholic-school fifth grader. One afternoon after school some of
my chums and I were on 239th Street in the Bronx in a vacant lot. This
was next to the apartment building I lived in. About seven or eight kids
were playing in the lot and we found a tattered brown paper bag. Of
course as children we were hoping for some wonderful treasure inside.
But the bag was filled only with magazines. They were all of women who
were naked and some of them looked like they were in pain. Several kids
were shocked. Some laughed. There were comments on how disgusting this
material was. People tried to guess who left the bag. While the
conversation went on it seemed like an eternity. I was sick inside. It
could have been my father. These were the kinds of books my father
looked at. In my house there were films, photographs and magazines. They
were all over. There was one item so abhorrent and violent that it is
difficult to describe to you.]{.font4}

[It was a handkerchief. I was putting the ironing away for my mother. We
ironed everything---sheets, pillow cases, towels, underwear, etc. I was
in my Dad's dresser, as I had permission to be. There was a hankie with
images of women imprinted on it. They were all bleeding from the vagina.
They looked to be in such awful pain. I had seen his magazines before
but nothing like this. I recall women with dark hair and some with Asian
features. I wanted to crawl up in a ball and die. Was this what my
father did to women? Was this what he thought should happen to women?
Did this happen to my mother? Was this going to happen to me? Why would
he keep this in our house? Was he going to go to hell for this? Was I
because I had seen it?]{.font4}

[Parties among adults in our house involved pornography. It was used to
get people to strip and "play games" particularly the Skyes and the
people from Lake George. I always made sure I cried into my pillow so no
one could hear me. I kept watch so no one would come into my younger
brother\['s\] and my bedroom. I would try to get up for the six o'clock
Mass, especially on a day after these parties. Sometimes I was so tired
I overslept and just made it to school. I could hear the haunting
laughter and screaming that went on for days.]{.font4}

[What I couldn't have known as a child, I have come to realize as an
adult who has worked with victims of violent crimes. And that is, that I
just wasn't looking at pictures---I was looking at women's lives. The
influence of pornography is not a literary or artistic influence but a
violent influence at the expense of women and children\['s\] lives. My
own healing process was very painful. I have worked with women who have
had pornography used while they were being beaten by their husbands. I
have heard from women that while they were being raped a perpetrator
referred to pornography. Sometimes women have told me they were forced
to imitate whatever was in the picture. One woman told me that her
entire incest victimization, by her older brother always included
pornography. Collectively, women have suffered humiliation, degradation
and violence at the hands of pornography. It has taken years to deal
with the turmoil of my own experience. One of my most painful struggles
even now at 43 years old is having a sense of my body size and physical
appearance. I have suffered eating disorders and had to overcome a great
deal of pain that I directly attribute to the barrage of sexually
explicit images and the activities that took place in my home.]{.font4}

[There is no pleasure in violence for the victim of pornography. The
private and public humiliation we feel at the hands of men and boys who
consume this woman-hating material cannot be understood by any
representation of government unless you have the insight and empathy to
understand that we speak of fear for our daily personal safety. The
integrity of our very existence is being jeopardized by men's
consumption and activities due to pornography.]{.font4}

[Thank you for your attention. Please support the Antipornography Civil
Rights Law. Through this you will acknowledge the harms of pornography
and provide relief to all women and children who seek its
protection.]{.font4}

[]{#massWrittenSubmissions.xhtml#bookmark5}[Submission of Gail Kielson,
Boston, Massachusetts]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[My name is Gail Kielson and I work at Necessities/Necesidades, an
organization in Northampton, Massachusetts that provides services to
battered women. I am a Licensed MSW, and for 17 years have worked with
women and children who were living with abuse. I am unable to testify in
person today because we at Necessities/Necesidades are short-staffed and
it is essential that I be there to work with the women using our
services, many of whom are living in life-threatening
situations.]{.font4}

[We have recently begun to formally ask the battered women who call us
whether the abuser uses pornography and from this we]{.font4}
[conservatively]{.font4 .sgc-6} [estimate that at least
[1/2]{.sgc-7}]{.font4} [of the abusers use pornography as a part of the
abuse. Battering is based on an issue of power and control, with the
abuser using all kinds of methods to continually assert his power and
control over the woman. Throughout, he is persistently working to deny
her of her ability to make informed decisions about her life and through
threats, coercion, and continual terror succeeds at clearly establishing
himself as "in control". We frequently hear a woman say that she feels
like a prisoner in her own home, and in fact, she is.]{.font4}

[The use of pornography is but one means that an abuser uses to degrade
and humiliate the woman. The stories that I hear are horrific and just
when I think I've heard it all, I hear another horrifying story that
sends me reeling. Women frequently state that abusers bring home
pornographic videos and make them perform the acts depicted in the
video. One woman described endless days and nights of this, with her
husband demanding that she leave her place of business, a shop that she
owned, and come home and enact the sexual tortures depicted on the
videos; or he would demand that she leave the caretaking of her children
and come into the locked bedroom and he would rape her. She attempted to
protect her children from the knowledge of what transpired behind these
locked doors, but their wide, terrified eyes indicated that they knew
that she was being abused and they were helpless to protect her. Another
woman said that she would come home from work, begin to make dinner for
her children, and would hear her husband come in, turn the television on
and know that he would then demand that she perform the acts shown on
the pornographic videos. She had no choice but to submit, because if she
did not he would threaten to beat her, or would beat her into
submission. Another woman described how her husband brought home the
videos and when she tried to withstand his sexual demands he put a gun
inside her vagina and thus forced her to submit to his acts of abuse.
Another woman said that her partner used pornographic books and read
portions to her and then made her perform the degrading sexual acts
described therein. Another woman said, tearfully, that her husband
brought home pornographic videos and made her have sex with other men as
he watched her and the videos simultaneously. Another woman said that
her partner, while watching pornographic videos, raped her with all
kinds of objects---pipes, sticks, knives. Perhaps the most horrifying
story of sexual abuse, linked to pornographic use I heard was from a
woman who was repeatedly raped, handcuffed to the bed, raped with all
kinds of objects by her husband who continually used pornographic
material. After years of terrifying abuse she managed to flee her
husband and come into our shelter. He pursued her, terrified her and her
children, threatened to kill her: When he was finally arrested and
incarcerated her children began to disclose sexual abuse. As the
children began to feel safer and safer their disclosures became more and
more horrifying, for their father, paternal grandparents and paternal
uncle had persistently and consistently, sexually abused them, using
pornographic videos as a constant part of the abuse. Not only had the
children been forced to have sex with each other and several playmates,
but the adults had used objects in their genitals, had killed animals in
their presence, had made them engage sexually with animals, had hung
them from rafters, had threatened to throw them off a cliff, all acts
depicted in the pornographic videos. The result was that after several
years of these disclosures, we were able to get the Commonwealth to
bring him to trial and he was given 80-100 years in prison. However,
these children are all in psychiatric treatment, one child had to be
placed in a residential facility because he was actively suicidal, one
child rarely talks, and walks through life with a haunted look, one
child acts out in school. The mother has flashbacks of her own sexual
abuse and lives, not only with her own terror, but with her self-imposed
guilt that she had not protected her children. She cannot hear me say to
her---"but he did this to them when you were off working, working to
support the family and he maintained the secrecy by threatening that if
they disclosed this horror he would kill them and you, their mother.
"]{.font4}

[Had I more time I could continue to regale you with stories that I have
heard women tell me about the connection of pornography and sexual
abuse. They have told me their stories with shame, with tears, with
resignation. As the words pour out of their mouths, sometimes
hesitantly, sometimes in a flood, I can see that they are reexperiencing
the horror of the acts, the horror of the degradation, the terror of the
moment. I share their tears, I share their horror, but I rage and I
seethe. Pornography is but one example of the underlying societal
sanctions of violence against women that is endemic and epidemic in our
country. I am working, daily, minute by minute, to arrest this epidemic.
You, as legislators, have an opportunity through this act, to make a
statement that says we are]{.font4} [all]{.font4} [ready to do something
to stop violence against women.]{.font4}

the complaint at any time prior to the close of proceedings with respect
thereto, except as otherwise provided in section 16-26. The complaint
and any response received shall not be made public by the chief officer,
the board or any member thereof or any agent or employee of the office,
unless and until a public hearing is scheduled thereon as provided in
section 16-26.]{.font4}

[Sec. 16-24. Investigation and conciliation.]{.font3 .sgc-1}

[(1)]{.font4} [Investigation]{.font4}[. Within ten (10) working days
after the receipt of a complaint filed pursuant to this chapter, the
chief officer shall initiate an investigation of the alleged
discriminatory practice charged in the complaint. All such
investigations shall be made by the office at the direction of the chief
officer and may include informal conferences or discussions with any
party to the complaint for the purpose of obtaining additional
information or attempting to resolve or eliminate the alleged
discriminatory practice by conciliation or persuasion. The office shall
have the authority to initiate discovery, including but
not ]{.font4}[limited to interrogatories, request for production of
documents and subpoenas, on approval of the chief officer at any time
within ten (10) working days after filing of a complaint. Any request by
the office to compel discovery may be by appropriate petition to the
Marion County circuit or superior courts.]{.sgc-4}

[(2)    ]{.font4}[Report of investigation; determination by
panel.]{.font4} [Unless the complaint has been satisfactorily resolved
prior thereto, the chief officer shall, within thirty (30) working days
after the date of filing of a complaint pursuant to section 16-17,
report the results of the investigation made pursuant to subsection (1)
to a panel of three (3) members of the board designated by the
chairperson or vice-chairperson or pursuant to the rules of the board,
which panel shall not include any member of the board who initiated the
complaint, who might have participated in the investigation of the
complaint, or who is a member of the complaint adjudication committee.
The chief officer shall make a recommendation as to whether there is
reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has violated sections
16-14 and/or 16-15. The chairperson, vice-chairperson or such other
member of the panel so designated may, for good cause shown, extend the
time for making such report. Such extension thereof shall be evidenced
in writing, and the office shall serve a copy of the extension on both
the complainant and the respondent. The panel shall then determine by
majority vote whether reasonable cause exists to believe that any
respondent has violated sections 16-14 and/or 16-15. In making such a
determination, the panel shall consider only the complaint, the
response, if any, and the chief officer's report; provided, however, the
panel may request the chief officer to make a supplemental investigation
and report with respect to any matter which it deems material to such
determination.]{.font4}

[(3)    ]{.font4}[Action when violation found.]{.font4} [If the panel,
pursuant to subsection]{.font4}

[(2), determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that any
respondent has violated sections 16-14 and/or 16-15, it may direct the
chief officer to endeavor to eliminate the alleged discriminatory
practice through a conciliation conference. At least one panel member
shall be present at any conciliation conference at which both the
complainant and respondent are present or represented. If the complaint
is satisfactorily resolved through conciliation, the terms of any
agreement reached or undertaking given by any party shall be reduced to
writing and signed by the complainant, respondent and the chief officer.
Any disagreement between the respondent and the chief officer in regard
to the terms or conditions of a proposed conciliation agreement
may ]{.font4}[be referred to the panel which considered the complaint,
and the decision of the panel with respect to such terms or conditions
shall be final for purposes of conciliation proceedings under this
subsection, but shall not be binding upon the respondent without his
written consent thereto. No action taken or statement made in connection
with any proceedings under this subsection, and no written conciliation
agreement or any of the terms thereof, shall be made public by the board
or any member thereof, or any agent or employee of the officer, without
the written consent of the parties, nor shall any such action, statement
or agreement be admissible in evidence in any subsequent proceedings;
provided, however, the board or officer may institute legal proceedings
under this chapter for enforcement of any written agreement or
undertaking executed in accordance with this subsection.]{.sgc-4}

[Sec. 16-25. Complaint adjudication committee; duties.]{.font4}

[A complaint adjudication committee is hereby established. The committee
shall be composed of seven (7) members of the board. The committee shall
meet for the purpose of holding public hearings on citizen's complaints,
which shall be at such times as its members deem necessary.]{.font4}

[Sec. 16-26. Hearings, findings and recommendations when conciliation
not effected.]{.font4}

[(a)    ]{.font4}[Hearing to be held; notice.]{.font4} [If a complaint
filed pursuant to this article has not been satisfactorily resolved
within a reasonable time through informal proceedings pursuant to
section 16-24, or if the panel investigating the complaint determines
that a conciliation conference is inappropriate under the circumstances
surrounding the complaint, the complaint adjudication committee may hold
a public hearing thereon upon not less than ten (10) working days'
written notice to the complainant or other aggrieved person, and to the
respondent. If the respondent has not previously filed a written
response to the complaint, he/she may file such response and serve a
copy thereof upon the complainant and the office not later than five (5)
working days prior to the date of the hearing.]{.font4}

[(b)    ]{.font4}[Powers; rights of parties at hearing.]{.font4} [In
connection with a hearing held pursuant to subsection (a), the complaint
adjudication committee shall have power, upon any matter pertinent to
the complaint or response thereto, to subpoena witnesses and compel
their attendance; to require the production of pertinent books, papers
or other documents; and to administer oaths. The complainant shall have
the right to be represented by the chief officer or any attorney of
his/her choice. The ]{.font4}[respondent shall have the right to be
represented by an attorney or any other person of his/her choice. The
complainant and respondent shall have the right to appear in person at
the hearing, to be represented by an attorney or any other person, to
subpoena and compel the attendance of witnesses, and to examine and
cross-examine witnesses. The complaint adjudication committee may adopt
appropriate rules for the issuance of subpoenas and the conduct of
hearings under this section. The complaint adjudication committee and
the board shall have the power to enforce discovery and subpoenas by
appropriate petition to the Marion County circuit or superior
courts.]{.sgc-4}

[(c)    ]{.font4}[Statement of evidence; exceptions; arguments.]{.font4}
[Within thirty (30) working days from the close of the hearing, the
complaint adjudication committee shall prepare a report containing
written recommended findings of fact and conclusions and file such
report with the office. A copy of the report shall be furnished to the
complainant and respondent, each of whom shall have an opportunity to
submit written exceptions within such time as the rules of the complaint
adjudication committee shall permit. The complaint adjudication
committee may, in its discretion, upon notice to each interested party
hear further evidence or argument upon the issues presented by the
report and exceptions, if any.]{.font4}

[(d)    ]{.font4}[Findings of fact; sustaining or dismissing
complaint.]{.font4} [If, upon the preponderance of the evidence, the
committee shall be of the opinion that any respondent has engaged or is
engaging in a discriminatory practice in violation of the chapter, it
shall state its findings of fact and conclusions and serve a copy
thereof upon the complainant and the respondent. In addition, the
committee may cause to be served on the respondent an order requiring
the respondent to cease and desist from the unlawful discriminatory
practice and requiring such person to take further affirmative action as
will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, including but not limited
to the power to restore complainant's losses incurred as a result of
discriminatory treatment, as the committee may deem necessary to assure
justice; to require the posting of notice setting forth the public
policy of Marion County concerning equal opportunity and respondent's
compliance with said policy in places of public accommodations; to
require proof of compliance to be filed by respondent at periodic
intervals; to require a person who has been found to be in violation of
this chapter and who is licensed by a city or county agency authorized
to grant a license, to show cause to the licensing agency why his
license should not be revoked or suspended. If, upon the preponderance
of the evidence, the committee shall be of the opinion that any
respondent has not engaged in a discriminatory practice in violation of
this chapter it shall state its findings of fact and conclusions and
serve a copy thereof upon the complainant and the respondent, and
dismiss the complaint. Findings and conclusions made by the committee
shall be based solely upon the record of the evidence presented at the
hearing.]{.font4}

[(e)    ]{.font4}[Appeal to the board]{.font4}[. Within thirty (30)
working days after the issuance of findings and conclusions by the
committee, either the complainant or the respondent may file a written
appeal of the decision of the committee to the board; however, in the
event that the committee requires the respondent to correct or eliminate
a discriminatory practice within a time period less than thirty (30)
working days, then that respondent must file his/her appeal within that
time period. After considering the record of the evidence presented at
the hearing and the findings and conclusions of the committee, the board
may affirm the decision of the committee and adopt the findings and
conclusions of the committee, or it may affirm the decision of the
committee and make supplemental findings and conclusions of its own, or
it may reverse the decision of the committee and make findings of fact
and conclusions to support its decision. The board may also adopt,
modify or reverse any relief ordered by the committee. The board must
take any of the above actions within thirty (30) working days after the
appeal is filed.]{.font4}

[(f)    ]{.font4}[Members of Board who are ineligible to
participate.]{.font4} [No member of the board who initiated a complaint
under this chapter or who participated in the investigation thereof
shall participate in any hearing or determination under this section as
a member of either a hearing panel, the complaint adjudication committee
or of the board.]{.font4}

[(g)    ]{.font4}[Applicability of state law; judicial review.]{.font4}
[Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section or in rules
adopted by the board or the complaint adjudication committee under this
chapter, the applicable provisions of the Administrative Adjudication
Act, IC 4-22-1, shall govern the conduct of hearings and determinations
under this section, and findings of the board hereunder shall be subject
to judicial review as provided in that act.]{.font4}

[Sec. 16-27. Court Enforcement.]{.font4}

[(a)]{.font4} [Institution of action.]{.font4} [In any case where the
board or the committee has found that a respondent has engaged in or is
engaging in a discriminatory practice in violation of sections 16-14
and/or 16-15, and such respondent has failed to correct or eliminate
such discriminatory practice within the time limit prescribed by the
board or the committee and the time limit for appeal to the board has
elapsed, the board may file in its own name in the Marion County circuit
or superior courts a complaint against the respondent for the
enforcement of section 16-26. Such complaint may request such temporary
or permanent injunctive relief as may be appropriate and such additional
affirmative relief or orders as will effectuate the purposes of this
chapter and as may be equitable, within the powers and jurisdiction of
the court.]{.font4}

[(b)    ]{.font4}[Record of hearing; evidentiary value.]{.font4} [In any
action filed pursuant to this section, the board may file with the court
a record of the hearing held by the complaint adjudication committee
pursuant to section 16-26, which record shall be certified by the
secretary of the board as a true, correct and complete record of the
proceedings upon which the findings of the complaint adjudication
committee and/or the board were based. The court may, in its discretion,
admit any evidence contained in the record as evidence in the action
filed under subsection (a), to the extent such evidence would be
admissible in court under the rules of evidence if the witness or
witnesses were present in court, without limitation upon the right of
any party to offer such additional evidence as may be pertinent to the
issues and as the court shall, in its discretion, permit.]{.font4}

[(c)    ]{.font4}[Temporary judicial relief upon filing of
complaint.]{.font4} [Upon the filing of a complaint pursuant to section
16-17 by a person claiming to be aggrieved, the chief officer, in the
name of the board and in accordance with such procedures as the board
shall establish by rule, may seek temporary orders for injunctions in
the Marion County circuit or superior courts to prevent irreparable harm
to the complainant, pending resolution of the complaint by the office,
complaint adjudication committee and the board.]{.font4}

[(d)    ]{.font4}[Enforcement of conciliating agreements.]{.font4} [If
the board determines that any party to a conciliation agreement approved
by the chief officer under section 16-24 has failed or refused to comply
with the terms of the agreement, it may file a complaint in the name of
the board in the Marion County circuit or superior courts seeking an
appropriate decree for the enforcement of the agreement.]{.font4}

[(e)    ]{.font4 .sgc-2}[Trial de novo upon finding of sex
discrimination related to pornog]{.font4 .sgc-2}[raphy.]{.font4 .sgc-2}
[In complaints involving discrimination through pornography,]{.font4

[Provided, however, that in any complaint under paragraph (g)(4)
of]{.font4 .sgc-1} [section 16-3 or against a seller, exhibitor or

from pornography and sex discrimination. The Judiciary.]{.font4}

[The Commonwealth of Massachusetts In the Year One Thousand Nine Hundred
and Ninety-Two.]{.font4}

[AN ACT TO PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.]{.font4}

[Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General
Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:]{.font4
.sgc-5}

[SECTION 1. It is hereby found and declared that pornography is a
practice of sex discrimination which exists in the commonwealth and
threatens the health, safety, peace, welfare and equality of its
citizens. Pornography is a systematic practice of exploitation and
subordination based on sex that differentially harms and disadvantages
women through dehumanization, psychic assault, sexual exploitation,
forced sex and prostitution, physical injury and social and sexual
terrorism and inferiority presented as entertainment and existing laws
have proven inadequate to solve such problem. It is further found that
the bigotry and contempt which pornography promotes and the acts of
aggression which it fosters:]{.font4}

[(a) diminish opportunities for equality of rights in employment,
education, property, public accommodations, and public services; (b)
create public and private harassment, persecution, and denigration;
promote injury and degradation such as rape, battery, sexual abuse of
children, and prostitution, and inhibit just enforcement of laws against
these acts;]{.font4}

[(c) demean the reputations and diminish the occupational opportunities
of individuals and groups on the basis of sex; (d) expose individuals
who appear in pornography against their will to contempt, ridicule,
hatred, humiliation, and embarrassment and target them for abuse and
physical aggression; (e) lower the human dignity, worth, and civil
status of women and damage mutual respect between the sexes; (f)
contribute significantly to restricting women in particular from full
exercise of citizenship and participation in the life of the community;
and (g) undermine women's equal exercise of rights to speech and action
guaranteed to all citizens under the laws and constitution of the
commonwealth.]{.font4}

[SECTION 2. The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after
chapter 15IE the following chapter:]{.font4}

[]{#theOrdinances5.xhtml#bookmark1}[CHAPTER 151F. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN
SEX DISCRIMINATION.]{.font3 .sgc-2}

[Section 1. As used in this chapter, the term "pornography" shall mean
the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or
words, including by electronic or other data retrieval systems, and
shall further include the presentation of women's body parts, including
but not limited to, vaginas, breasts or buttocks, such that women are
reduced to such parts or the presentation of women:]{.font4}

[(a)    as dehumanized sexual objects, things or commodities;]{.font4}

[(b)    as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain;]{.font4}

[(c)    as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape, incest
or other sexual assault;]{.font4}

[(d)    as sexual objects tied up or cut up or mutilated, bruised or
physically hurt;]{.font4}

[(e)    in postures or positions of sexual submission, servility or
display;]{.font4}

[(f)    being penetrated by objects or animals; or]{.font4}

[(g)    in scenarios of degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown
as filthy or inferior, bleeding, bruised or hurt in a context that makes
these conditions sexual.]{.font4}

[The use of men, children or transsexuals in the place of women shall
also be deemed to be pornography for purposes of this
definition.]{.font4}

[Section 2. (a). It shall be sex discrimination to coerce, intimidate or
fraudulently induce any person into performing for pornography. The
injury incurred hereunder may occur upon any appearance or sale of any
product resulting from such performance. The maker, seller, exhibitor or
distributor of said pornography may be liable for damages and subject to
an injunction to prohibit or eliminate such product from the public
view. For purposes of this subsection proof of the following facts shall
not, singly or in combination, disprove coercion:]{.font4}

[(1)    the person is a woman or a girl;]{.font4}

[(2)    the person is or has been a prostitute;]{.font4}

[(3)    the person has attained the age of majority;]{.font4}

[(4)    the person is connected by blood or marriage to anyone involved
in or related to the making of the pornography;]{.font4}

[(5)    the person has previously had, or been thought to have had,
sexual relations with anyone, including anyone involved in or related to
the making of the pornography;]{.font4}

[(6)    the person has previously posed for sexually explicit pictures
with or for anyone, including anyone involved in or related to the
making of the pornography;]{.font4}

[(7)    anyone else, including a spouse or other relative, has given
permission on the person's behalf;]{.font4}

[(8)    the person actually consented to a use of a performance that is
then changed into pornography;]{.font4}

[(9)    the person knew that the purpose of the acts or events in
question was to make pornography;]{.font4}

[(10)    the person showed no resistance or appeared to cooperate
actively in the photographic sessions or events that produced the
pornography;]{.font4}

[(11)    the person signed a contract, or made statements affirming a
willingness to cooperate in the production of the pornography;]{.font4}

[(12)    no physical force, threats, or weapons were used in the making
of the pornography; or]{.font4}

[(13)    the person was paid or otherwise compensated.]{.font4}

[(b)    It shall be sex discrimination to force pornography on a person
in any place of employment, education, home, or any public place.
Complaints may be brought only against the perpetrator of the force or
the entity or institution responsible for the force.]{.font4}

[(c)    It shall be sex discrimination to assault, physically attack, or
injure any person in a way that is directly caused by specific
pornography. Complaints may be brought against the perpetrator of the
assault or attack, or against the maker, distributor, seller, or
exhibitor of the specific pornography.]{.font4}

[(d)    It shall be sex discrimination to defame any person through the
unauthorized use in pornography of their proper name, image, or
recognizable personal likeness. For purposes of this subsection, public
figures shall be treated as private persons. Authorization once given
may be revoked in writing any time prior to any publication.]{.font4}

[(e)    It shall be sex discrimination to produce, sell, exhibit, or
distribute pornography, including through private clubs. This subsection
applies only to pornography made using live or dead human beings or
animals. Isolated parts shall not be the sole basis for complaints under
this subsection.]{.font4}

[City, state, and federally funded public libraries or private and
public university and college libraries in which pornography is
available for study, including on open shelves but excluding special
display presentations, shall not be construed to be trafficking in
pornography.]{.font4}

[Any woman may bring a complaint hereunder as a woman acting against the
subordination of women. Any man, child, or transsexual who alleges
injury by pornography in the way women are injured by it may also
complain.]{.font4}

[Section 3. It shall not be a defense to a complaint brought under this
chapter that the respondent did not know or intend that the materials at
issue were pornography or sex discrimination.]{.font4}

[No damages or compensation for losses shall be recoverable under
subsection (e) of section two, or other than against the perpetrator of
the assault or attack under subsection (c) of section two, unless the
defendant knew or had reason to know that the materials were
pornography.]{.font4}

[Section 4. Any person who has a cause of action under this chapter, or
their estate, may complain directly to a court of competent jurisdiction
for relief.]{.font4}

[Any person who has a cause of action under this chapter, or their
estate, may seek nominal, compensatory, punitive damages without
limitation, including for loss, pain, suffering, reduced enjoyment of
life, and special damages, as well as for reasonable costs, including
attorneys' fees and costs of investigation.]{.font4}

[In claims under subsection (e) of section two, or other than against
the perpetrator of the assault or attack under subsection (c) of section
two, no damages or compensation for losses shall be recoverable against
the maker for pornography made, against a distributor for pornography
distributed, against a seller for pornography sold, or against an
exhibitor for pornography exhibited, prior to the effective date of this
chapter.]{.font4}

[Any person who violates this law may be enjoined except that:]{.font4}

[(a)    In actions under subsection (e) of section two, and other than
against the perpetrator of the assault or attack under subsection (c) of
section two, no temporary or permanent injunction shall issue prior to a
final judicial determination that the challenged activities constitute a
violation of this law.]{.font4}

[(b)    No temporary or permanent injunction shall extend beyond such
pornography that, having been described with reasonable specificity by
said order, is determined to be validly proscribed under this
chapter.]{.font4}

[Section 5. The availability of relief under this chapter is not
intended to be exclusive and shall not preclude, or be precluded by, the
seeking of any other relief, whether civil or criminal.]{.font4}

[Section 6. Complaints pursuant to this chapter shall be brought within
six years of the accrual of the cause of action or from when the
complainant reaches the age of majority, whichever is later.]{.font4}

[Clearly, the pornographers know the difference between what they sell
and the stock in trade of American Booksellers. These pornographers then
disappeared from the proceedings, taking no further visible part.
Presumably, the appearance of real pornographers was a momentary
embarrassment to the Media Coalition's First Amendment strategy of
hiding pornography behind their legitimate front, of erasing the line
drawn by the ordinance between pornography and other verbal and visual
materials, to their defense that pornography is indistinguishable from
art and literature.]{.font4}

[Indianapolis appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
The attorneys for Indianapolis were Mark Dali and Kathryn A. Watson.

Task Force (Nan D. Hunter). ^4^ Nan D. Hunter was employed as a staff

[The Seventh Circuit affirmed, finding that the ordinance violated the
First Amendment, in a decision set out in full below]{.font4} [(American
Booksellers, Inc. v. Hudnut,]{.font4} [771 F. 2d 323 \[7th Cir. 1985\]).
Subsequently, Indianapolis took a direct appeal to the U. S. Supreme
Court, which affirmed summarily, 106 S. Ct. 1172 (1986). A summary
affirmance, now largely obsolete, is a device through which the U. S.
Supreme Court, without reading briefs or hearing oral argument, upholds
an appellate result without expressing any views on the reasoning used
in the opinion that reached that result. While summary affirmances are
formally rulings on the merits, the reasoning in the appellate opinions
affirmed---in this instance, the decision written by Judge Easterbrook
below---is binding only in the circuit in which it was written. This
leaves substantial latitude, for example, for another ordinance to be
introduced, to be found constitutional in another circuit, and to be
reviewed and upheld by the Supreme Court. The likelihood of a finding of
constitutionality is improved if the ordinance is revised or if the law
of the subject has changed in the interim.]{.font4}

[Before CUDAHY and EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judges, and SWY-GERT, Senior
Circuit Judge.]{.font4}

[EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge.]{.font4}

[Indianapolis enacted an ordinance defining "pornography" as a practice
that discriminates against women. "Pornography" is to be redressed
through the administrative and judicial methods used for other
discrimination. The City's definition of "pornography" is considerably
different from "obscenity, " which the Supreme Court has held is not
protected by the First Amendment.]{.font4}

[To be "obscene" under Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 93 S. Ct.
2607, 37 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1973), "a publication must, taken as a whole,
appeal to the prurient interest, must contain patently offensive
depictions or descriptions of specified sexual conduct, and on the whole
have no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. "
Brockett v. Spokane]{.font4}

[Arcades, Inc., -U. S. -, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 2800, 86 L. Ed. 2d
394]{.font4}

[(1985). Offensiveness must be assessed under the standards of the
community. Both offensiveness and an appeal to something other than
"normal, healthy sexual desires" (Brockett, supra, 105 S. Ct. at 2799)
are essential elements of "obscenity. "]{.font4}

["Pornography" under the ordinance is "the graphic sexually explicit
subordination of women, whether in pictures or in words, that also
includes one or more of the following: (1) Women are presented as sexual
objects who enjoy pain or humiliation; or (2) Women are presented as
sexual objects who experience sexual pleasure in being raped; or
(3) ]{.font4}[Women are presented as sexual objects tied up or cut up or
mutilated or bruised or physically hurt, or as dismembered or truncated
or fragmented or severed into body parts; or (4) Women are presented as
being penetrated by objects or animals; or (5) Women are presented in
scenarios of degradation, injury, abasement, torture, shown as filthy or
inferior, bleeding, bruised, or hurt in a context that makes these
conditions sexual; or (6) Women are presented as sexual objects for
domination, conquest, violation, exploitation, possession, or use, or
through postures or positions of servility or submission or display. "
Indianapolis Code s 16-3(q). The statute provides that the "use of men,
children, or transsexuals in the place of women in paragraphs (1)
through (6) above shall also constitute pornography under this section.
" The ordinance as passed in April 1984 defined "sexually explicit" to
mean actual or simulated intercourse or the uncovered exhibition of the
genitals, buttocks or anus. An amendment in June 1984 deleted this
provision, leaving the term undefined.]{.sgc-6}

[The Indianapolis ordinance does not refer to the prurient interest, to
offensiveness, or to the standards of the community. It demands
attention to particular depictions, not to the work judged as a whole.
It is irrelevant under the ordinance whether the work has literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value. The City and many amici point
to these omissions as virtues. They maintain that pornography influences
attitudes, and the statute is a way to alter the socialization of men
and women rather than to vindicate community standards of offensiveness.
And as one of the principal drafters of the ordinance has asserted, "if
a woman is subjected, why should it matter that the work has other
value? " Catharine A. MacKinnon, Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech,
20 Harv. Civ. Rts. ---Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 1, 21 (1985).]{.font4}

[Civil rights groups and feminists have entered this case as amici on
both sides. Those supporting the ordinance say that it will play an
important role in reducing the tendency of men to view women as sexual
objects, a tendency that leads to both unacceptable attitudes and
discrimination in the workplace and violence away from it. Those
opposing the ordinance point out that much radical feminist literature
is explicit and depicts women in ways forbidden by the ordinance and
that the ordinance would reopen old battles. It is unclear how
Indianapolis would treat works from James Joyce's]{.font4}
[Ulysses]{.font4} [to Homer's]{.font4} [Iliad;]{.font4} [both depict
women as submissive objects for conquest and domination.]{.font4}

[We do not try to balance the arguments for and against an ordinance
such as this. The ordinance discriminates on the ground of the content
of the speech. Speech treating women in the approved way---in sexual
encounters "premised on equality" (MacKinnon, supra, at 22)---is lawful
no matter how sexually explicit. Speech treating women in the
disapproved way---as submissive in matters sexual or as enjoying
humiliation---is unlawful no matter how significant the literary,
artistic, or political qualities of the work taken as a whole. The state
may not ordain preferred viewpoints in this way. The Constitution
forbids the state to declare one perspective right and silence
opponents.]{.font4}

[]{#appendix1.xhtml#bookmark6}[I]{.font4 .sgc-2}

[The ordinance contains four prohibitions. People may not "traffic" in
pornography, "coerce" others into performing in pornographic works, or
"force" pornography on anyone. Anyone injured by someone who has seen or
read pornography has a right of action against the maker or
seller.]{.font4}

[Trafficking is defined in s l6-3(g)(4) as the "production, sale,
exhibition, or distribution of pornography. " The offense excludes
exhibition in a public or educational library, but a "special display"
in a library may be sex discrimination. Section 16-3(g)(4)(C) provides
that the trafficking paragraph "shall not be construed to make isolated
passages or isolated parts actionable. "]{.font4}

["Coercion into pornographic performance" is defined in s 16-3(g)(5) as
"\[c\]oercing, intimidating or fraudulently inducing any person\... into
performing for pornography\.... " The ordinance specifies that proof of
any of the following "shall not constitute a defense: I. That the person
is a woman;\... VI. That the person has previously posed for sexually
explicit pictures\... with anyone    VIII. That the person
actually ]{.font4}[consented to a use of the performance that is changed
into pornography;\... IX. That the person knew that the purpose of the
acts or events in question was to make pornography;\... XI. That the
person signed a contract, or made statements affirming a willingness to
cooperate in the production of pornography; XII. That no physical force,
threats, or weapons were used in the making of the pornography; or XIII.
That the person was paid or otherwise compensated. "]{.sgc-6}

["Forcing pornography on a person, " according to s 16-3(g)(5), is the
"forcing of pornography on any woman, man, child, or transsexual in any
place of employment, in education, in a home, or in any public place. "
The statute does not define forcing, but one of its authors states that
the definition reaches pornography shown to medical students as part of
their education or given to language students for translation.
MacKinnon, supra, at 40-41.]{.font4}

[Section 16-3(g)(7) defines as a prohibited practice the "assault,
physical attack, or injury of any woman, man, child, or transsexual in a
way that is directly caused by specific pornography. "]{.font4}

[For purposes of all four offenses, it is generally "not\... a defense
that the respondent did not know or intend that the materials were
pornography\.... " Section 16-3 (g)(8). But the ordinance provides that
damages are unavailable in trafficking cases unless the complainant
proves "that the respondent knew or had reason to know that the
materials were pornography. " It is a complete defense to a trafficking
case that all of the materials in question were pornography only by
virtue of category (6) of the definition of pornography. In cases of
assault caused by pornography, those who seek damages from "a seller,
exhibitor or distributor" must show that the defendant knew or had
reason to know of the material's status as pornography. By implication,
those who seek damages from an author need not show this.]{.font4}

[A woman aggrieved by trafficking in pornography may file a complaint
"as a woman acting against the subordination of women" with the office
of equal opportunity. Section 16-17(b). A man, child, or transsexual
also may protest trafficking "but must prove injury in the same way that
a woman is injured\.... " Ibid. Subsection (a) also provides, however,
that "any person claiming to be aggrieved" by trafficking, coercion,
forcing, or assault may complain against the "perpetrators. " We need
not decide whether s 16-17(b) qualifies the right of action in s
16-17(a).]{.font4}

[The office investigates and within 30 days makes a recommendation to a
panel of the equal opportunity advisory board. The panel then decides
whether there is reasonable cause to proceed (s 16-24(2)) and may refer
the dispute to a conciliation conference or to a complaint adjudication
committee for a hearing (ss 16-24(3), 16-26(a)). The committee uses the
same procedures ordinarily associated with civil rights litigation. It
may make findings and enter orders, including both orders to cease and
desist and orders "to take further affirmative action\... including but
not limited to the power to restore complainant's losses\.... " Section
16-26(d). Either party may appeal the committee's decision to the board,
which reviews the record before the committee and may modify its
decision.]{.font4}

[Under Indiana law an administrative decision takes effect when
rendered, unless a court issues a stay. Ind. Stat. s 4-22-1-13. The
board's decisions are subject to review in the ordinary course. Ind.
Stat. s 4-22-1-]{.font4}

[14.  Judicial review in pornography cases is to be de novo,
Indianapolis Code s 16-27(e), which provides a second complete hearing.
When the board finds that a person has engaged in trafficking or that a
seller, exhibitor, or distributor is responsible for an assault, it must
initiate judicial review of its own decision, ibid., and the statute
prohibits injunctive relief in these cases in advance of the court's
final decision. (This is unlike the usual procedure under state law,
which permits summary enforcement. Ind. Stat. ss 4-22-1-18 and
4-22-1-27. ) ]{.font4}[The district court held the ordinance
unconstitutional. 598 F. Supp. 1316 (S. D. Ind. 1984). The court
concluded that the ordinance regulates speech rather than the conduct
involved in making pornography. The regulation of speech could be
justified, the court thought, only by a compelling interest in reducing
sex discrimination, an interest Indianapolis had not established. The
ordinance is also vague and overbroad, the court believed, and
establishes a prior restraint of speech.]{.sgc-6}

[II]{.font4}

[The plaintiffs are a congeries of distributors and readers of books,
magazines, and films. The American Booksellers Association comprises
about 5, 200 bookstores and chains. The Association for American
Publishers includes most of the country's publishers. Video Shack, Inc.,
sells and rents video cassettes in Indianapolis. Kelly Bentley, a
resident of Indianapolis, reads books and watches films. There are many
more plaintiffs. Collectively the plaintiffs (or their members, whose
interests they represent) make, sell, or read just about every kind of
material that could be affected by the ordinance, from hard-core films
to W. B. Yeats's poem "Leda and the Swan" (from the myth of Zeus in the
form of a swan impregnating an apparently subordinate Leda), to the
collected works of James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, and John
Cleland.]{.font4}

[\[2\] The interests of Bentley and many of the members of the
organizational plaintiffs are directly affected by the ordinance, which
gives them standing to attack it. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 11-12
& n. 10, 96 S. Ct. 612, 630-31 & n. 10, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976). There
is no need to invoke the special standing rules applicable to overbroad
laws that affect speech, see Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 452 U.
S. 61, 101 S. Ct. 2176, 68 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1981); Henry P. Monaghan,
Overbreadth,. 1981 Sup. Ct. Rev. 1.]{.font4}

[\[3\]\[4\] The district court prevented the ordinance from taking
effect. The expedition with which this suit was filed raises questions
of ripeness and abstention. Ripeness is a prudential question, see
Buckley, supra, 424 U. S. at 13-18, 96 S. Ct. at 631-34; Thomas v. Union
Carbide  ]{.font4}[Agricultural Products Co., -U. S. -, 105 S. Ct. 3325,
3332-34, 87 ]{.sgc-6}[L. Ed. 2d 409 (1985). A case is not ripe if the
issues are still poorly formed or the application of the statute is
uncertain. A challenge may be ripe, however, even when the statute is
not yet effective. Entertainment Concepts, Inc. v. Maciejewski, 631 F.
2d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1980), cert, denied, 450 U. S. 919, 101 S. Ct.
1366, 67 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1981). The statute challenged in Pierce v.
Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925),
had an effective date two years in the future, yet the Court found the
suit ripe. Here, as in Pierce, the dispute may be resolved without
reference to the administration of the statute. We gain nothing by
waiting. Time would take a toll, however, on the speech of the parties
subject to the act. They must take special care not to release material
that might be deemed pornographic, for that material could lead to
awards of damages. Deferred adjudication would produce tempered speech
without assisting in resolution of the controversy.]{.sgc-6}

[It is also inappropriate to abstain under Railroad Commission v.
Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496, 61 S. Ct. 643, 85 L. Ed. 971 (1941).
Abstention is appropriate when state courts may clarify the meaning of a
statute, thus sharpening the constitutional dispute and perhaps
preventing an unnecessary constitutional adjudication. This statute,
however, is all too clear. Cf. Mazanec v. North Judson---San Pierre
School Corp., 763 F. 2d 845, 848 (7th Cir. 1985). A state court could
not construe this ordinance as an "ordinary" obscenity law; another law
serves that function. Ind. Stat. s 35-49-1-1 et seq. It is designed to
be distinctively different, to prohibit explicitly sexual speech that
"subordinates" women in specified ways. If abstention was unnecessary in
Brockett, despite the argument (which convinced the Chief Justice and
Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor, see 105 S. Ct. at 2804-05) that a state
court could save the statute by excising or construing a single element
of the definition of obscenity, it surely is unnecessary here, for it is
the structure of the statute rather \'than the meaning of any one of its
terms that leads to the constitutional problem.]{.font4}

[]{#appendix1.xhtml#bookmark7}[III]{.font3 .sgc-2}

[\[5\] "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,
it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be
orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion
or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. " West
Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642, 63 S.
Ct. 1178, 1187, 87 L. Ed. 1628 (1943). Under the First Amendment the
government must leave to the people the evaluation of ideas. Bald or
subtle, an idea is as powerful as the audience allows it to be. A belief
may be pernicious---the beliefs of Nazis led to the death of millions,
those of the Klan to the repression of millions. A pernicious belief may
prevail. Totalitarian governments today rule much of the planet,
practicing suppression of billions and spreading dogma that may enslave
others. One of the things that separates our society from theirs is our
absolute right to propagate opinions that the government finds wrong or
even hateful.]{.font4}

[The ideas of the Klan may be propagated. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.
444, 89 S. Ct. 1827, 23 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1969). Communists may speak
freely and run for office. Dejonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353, 57 S. Ct.
255, 81 L. Ed. 278 (1937). The Nazi Party may march through a city with
a large Jewish population. Collin v. Smith, 578 F. 2d 1197 (7th Cir. ),
cert, denied, 439 U. S. 916, 99 S. Ct. 291, 58 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1978).
People may criticize the President by misrepresenting his positions, and
they have a right to post their misrepresentations on public property.
Lebron v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 749 F. 2d 893
(D. C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J. ). People may teach religions that others
despise. People may seek to repeal laws guaranteeing equal opportunity
in employment or to revoke the constitutional amendments granting the
vote to blacks and women. They may do this because "above all else, the
First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict
expression because of its message \[or\] its ideas\.... " Police
Department v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95, 92 S. Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L. Ed.
2d 212 (1972). See also Geoffrey R. Stone, Content Regulation and the
First Amendment, 25 William & Mary L. Rev. 189 (1983); Paul B. Stephan,
The First Amendment and Content Discrimination, 68 Va. L. Rev. 203,
233-36 (1982).]{.font4}

[Under the ordinance graphic sexually explicit speech is "pornography"
or not depending on the perspective the author adopts. Speech that
"subordinates" women and also, for example, presents women as enjoying
pain, humiliation, or rape, or even simply presents women in "positions
of servility or submission or display" is forbidden, no matter how great
the literary or political value of the work taken as a whole. Speech
that portrays women in positions of equality is lawful, no matter how
graphic the sexual content. This is thought control. It establishes an
"approved" view of women, of how they may react to sexual encounters, of
how the sexes may relate to each other. Those who espouse the approved
view may use sexual images; those who do not, may not.]{.font4}

[Indianapolis justifies the ordinance on the ground that pornography
affects thoughts. Men who see women depicted as subordinate are more
likely to treat them so. Pornography is an aspect of dominance. \[1\] It
does not persuade people so much as change them. It works by
socializing, by establishing the expected and the permissible. In this
view pornography is not an idea; pornography is the injury.]{.font4}

[There is much to this perspective. Beliefs are also facts. People often
act in accordance with the images and patterns they find around them.
People raised in a religion tend to accept the tenets of that religion,
often without independent examination. People taught from birth that
black people are fit only for slavery rarely rebelled against that
creed; beliefs coupled with the self-interest of the masters established
a social structure that inflicted great harm while enduring for
centuries. Words and images act at the level of the subconscious before
they persuade at the level of the conscious. Even the truth has little
chance unless a statement fits within the framework of beliefs that may
never have been subjected to rational study.]{.font4}

[Therefore we accept the premises of this legislation. Depictions of
subordination tend to perpetuate subordination. The subordinate status
of women in turn leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and
injury at home, battery and rape on the streets. \[2\] In the language
of the legislature, "\[p\]ornography is central in creating and
maintaining sex as a basis of discrimination. Pornography is a
systematic practice of exploitation and subordination based on sex which
differentially harms women. The bigotry and contempt it produces, with
the acts of aggression it fosters, harm women's opportunities for
equality and rights \[of all kinds\]. " Indianapolis Code s 16-1
(a)(2).]{.font4}

[Yet this simply demonstrates the power of pornography as speech. All of
these unhappy effects depend on mental intermediation. Pornography
affects how people see the world, their fellows, and social relations.
If pornography is what pornography does, so is other speech. Hitler's
orations affected how some Germans saw Jews. Communism is a world view,
not simply a Manifesto by Marx and Engels or a set of speeches. Efforts
to suppress communist speech in the United States were based on the
belief that the public acceptability of such ideas would increase the
likelihood of totalitarian government. Religions affect socialization in
the most pervasive way. The opinion in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S.
205, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972), shows how a religion can
dominate an entire approach to life, governing much more than the
relation between the sexes. Many people believe that the existence of
television, apart from the content of specific programs, leads to
intellectual laziness, to a penchant for violence, to many other ills.
The Alien and Sedition Acts passed during the administration of John
Adams rested on a sincerely held belief that disrespect for the
government leads to social collapse and revolution---a belief with
support in the history of many nations. Most governments of the world
act on this empirical regularity, suppressing critical speech. In the
United States, however, the strength of the support for this belief is
irrelevant. Seditious libel is protected speech unless the danger is not
only grave but also imminent. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.
S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964); cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio,
supra; New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713, 91 S. Ct.
2140, 29 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1971).]{.font4}

[Racial bigotry, anti-semitism, violence on television, reporters'
biases ---these and many more influence the culture and shape our
socialization. None is directly answerable by more speech, unless that
speech too finds its place in the popular culture. Yet all is protected
as speech, however insidious. Any other answer leaves the government in
control of all of the institutions of culture, the great censor and
director of which thoughts are good for us.]{.font4}

[Sexual responses often are unthinking responses, and the association of
sexual arousal with the subordination of women therefore may have a
substantial effect. But almost all cultural stimuli provoke unconscious
responses. Religious ceremonies condition their participants. Teachers
convey messages by selecting what not to cover; the implicit message
about what is off limits or unthinkable may be more powerful than the
messages for which they present rational argument. Television scripts
contain unarticulated assumptions. People may be conditioned in subtle
ways. If the fact that speech plays a role in a process of conditioning
were enough to permit governmental regulation, that would be the end of
freedom of speech.]{.font4}

[It is possible to interpret the claim that the pornography is the harm
in a different way. Indianapolis emphasizes the injury that models in
pornographic films and pictures may suffer. The record contains
materials depicting sexual torture, penetration of women by red-hot
irons and the like. These concerns have nothing to do with written
materials subject to the statute, and physical injury can occur with or
without the "subordination" of women. As we discuss in Part IV, a state
may make injury in the course of producing a film unlawful independent
of the viewpoint expressed in the film.]{.font4}

[The more immediate point, however, is that the image of pain is not
necessarily pain. In]{.font4} [Body Double,]{.font4} [a suspense film
directed by Brian De-Palma, a woman who has disrobed and presented a
sexually explicit display is murdered by an intruder with a drill. The
drill runs through the woman's body. The film is sexually explicit and a
murder occurs---yet no one believes that the actress suffered pain or
died. In]{.font4} [Barbarella]{.font4} [a character played by Jane Fonda
is at times displayed in sexually explicit ways and at times shown
"bleeding, bruised, \[and\] hurt in a context that makes these
conditions sexual"---and again no one believes that Fonda was actually
tortured to make the film. In]{.font4} [Carnal Knowledge]{.font4} [a
woman grovels to please the sexual whims of a character played by Jack
Nicholson; no one believes that there was a real sexual submission, and
the Supreme Court held the film protected by the First Amendment.
Jenkins v. Georgia, 418 U. S. 153, 94 S. Ct. 2750, 41 L. Ed. 2d 642
(1974). And this works both ways. The description of women's sexual
domination of men in]{.font4} [Lysistrata]{.font4} [was not real
dominance. Depictions may affect slavery, war, or sexual roles, but a
book about slavery is not itself slavery, or a book about death by
poison a murder.]{.font4}

[Much of Indianapolis's argument rests on the belief that when speech is
"unanswerable, " and the metaphor that there is a "marketplace of ideas"
does not apply, the First Amendment does not apply either. The metaphor
is honored; Milton's]{.font4} [Areopagitica]{.font4} [and John Stuart
Mill's]{.font4} [On Liberty]{.font4} [defend freedom of speech on the
ground that the truth will prevail, and many of the most important cases
under the First Amendment recite this position. The Framers undoubtedly
believed it. As a general matter it is true. But the Constitution does
not make the dominance of truth a necessary condition of freedom of
speech. To say that it does would be to confuse an outcome of free
speech with a necessary condition for the application of the
amendment.]{.font4}

[A power to limit speech on the ground that truth has not yet prevailed
and is not likely to prevail implies the power to declare truth. At some
point the government must be able to say (as Indianapolis has said): "We
know what the truth is, yet a free exchange of speech has not driven out
falsity, so that we must now prohibit falsity. " If the government may
declare the truth, why wait for the failure of speech? Under the First
Amendment, however, there is no such thing as a false idea, Gertz v.
Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 339, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 3006, 41 L. Ed.
2d 789 (1974), so the government may not restrict speech on the ground
that in a free exchange truth is not yet dominant.]{.font4}

[At any time, some speech is ahead in the game; the more numerous
speakers prevail. Supporters of minority candidates may be forever
"excluded" from the political process because their candidates never
win, because few people believe their positions. This does not mean that
freedom of speech has failed.]{.font4}

[The Supreme Court has rejected the position that speech must be
"effectively answerable" to be protected by the Constitution. For
example, in Buckley v. Valeo, supra, 424 U. S. at 39-54, 96 S. Ct. at
644-51, the Court held unconstitutional limitations on expenditures that
were neutral with regard to the speakers' opinions and designed to make
it easier for one person to answer another's speech. See also FEC v.
National Conservative PAC, -U. S. -, 105 S. Ct. 1459, 84 L. Ed. 2d 455
(1985). In]{.font4}

[Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, 86 S. Ct. 1434, 16 L. Ed. 2d 484
(1966), the Court held unconstitutional a statute prohibiting editorials
on election day---a statute the state had designed to prevent speech
that came too late for answer. In cases from Eastern Railroad Presidents
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5
L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), through NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S.
886, 102 S. Ct. 3409, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1215 (1982), the Court has held that
the First Amendment protects political stratagems---obtaining
legislation through underhanded ploys and outright fraud in Noerr,
obtaining political and economic ends through boycotts in Claiborne
Hardware--- that may be beyond effective correction through more
speech.]{.font4}

[We come, finally, to the argument that pornography is "low value"
speech, that it is enough like obscenity that Indianapolis may prohibit
it. Some cases hold that speech far removed from politics and other
subjects at the core of the Framers' concerns may be subjected to
special regulation. E. g., FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 98
S. Ct. 3026, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1073 (1978); Young v. American Mini Theatres,
Inc., 427 U. S. 50, 67-70, 96 S. Ct. 2440, 2450-52, 49 L. Ed. 2d 310
(1976) (plurality opinion); Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568,
571-72, 62 S. Ct. 766, 768-69, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942). These cases do not
sustain statutes that select among viewpoints, however. In Pacifica the
FCC sought to keep vile language off the air during certain times. The
Court held that it may; but the Court would not have sustained a
regulation prohibiting scatological descriptions of Republicans but not
scatological descriptions of Democrats, or any other form of selection
among viewpoints. See Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Chicago Transit
Authority, 767 F. 2d 1225, 1232-33 (7th Cir. 1985).]{.font4}

[At all events, "pornography" is not low value speech within the meaning
of these cases. Indianapolis seeks to prohibit certain speech because it
believes this speech influences social relations and politics on a grand
scale, that it controls attitudes at home and in the legislature. This
precludes a characterization of the speech as low value. True,
pornography and obscenity have sex in common. But Indianapolis left out
of its definition any reference to literary, artistic, political, or
scientific value. The ordinance applies to graphic sexually explicit
subordination in works great and small. \[3\] The Court sometimes
balances the value of speech against the costs of its restriction, but
it does this by category of speech and not by the content of particular
works. See John Hart Ely, "Flag Desecration: A Case Study in the Roles
of Categorization and Balancing in First Amendment Analysis, "
88]{.font4} [Harv. L. Rev.]{.font4} [1482 (1975); Geoffrey R. Stone,
"Restrictions of Speech Because of its Content: The Strange Case of
Subject-Matter Restrictions, " 46]{.font4} [U. Chi. L. Rev.]{.font4} [81
(1978). Indianapolis has created an approved point of view and so loses
the support of these cases.]{.font4}

[Any rationale we could imagine in support of this ordinance could not
be limited to sex discrimination. Free speech has been on balance an
ally of those seeking change. Governments that want stasis start by
restricting speech. Culture is a powerful force of continuity;
Indianapolis paints pornography as part of the culture of power. Change
in any complex system ultimately depends on the ability of outsiders to
challenge accepted views and the reigning institutions. Without a strong
guarantee of freedom of speech, there is no effective right to challenge
what is.]{.font4}

[IV]{.font4}

[The definition of "pornography" is unconstitutional. No construction or
excision of particular terms could save it. The offense of trafficking
in pornography necessarily falls with the definition. We express no view
on the district court's conclusions that the ordinance is vague and that
it establishes a prior restraint. Neither is necessary to our judgment.
We also express no view on the argument presented by several amici that
the ordinance is itself a form of discrimination on account of
sex.]{.font4}

[Section 8 of the ordinance is a strong severability clause, and
Indianapolis asks that we parse the ordinance to save what we can. If a
court could do this by surgical excision, this might be possible. Zbaraz
v. Har-tigan, 763 F. 2d 1532, 1545 (7th Cir. 1985). But a federal court
may not completely reconstruct a local ordinance, and we conclude that
nothing short of rewriting could save anything.]{.font4}

[The offense of coercion to engage in a pornographic performance, for
example, has elements that might be constitutional. Without question a
state may prohibit fraud, trickery, or the use of force to induce people
to perform---in pornographic films or in any other films. Such a statute
may be written without regard to the viewpoint depicted in the work. New
York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113
(1982), suggests that when a state has a strong interest in forbidding
the conduct that makes up a film (in Ferber sexual acts involving
minors), it may restrict or forbid dissemination of the film in order to
reinforce the prohibition of the conduct. A state may apply such a rule
to non-sexual coercion (although it need not). We suppose that if
someone forced a prominent political figure, at gunpoint, to endorse a
candidate for office, a state could forbid the commercial sale of the
film containing that coerced endorsement. The same principle allows a
court to enjoin the publication of stolen trade secrets and award
damages for the publication of copyrighted matter without permission.
See Harper & Row, Publishers, ]{.font4}[Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, -U.
S. -, 105 S. Ct., 2218, 85 L. Ed. 2d ]{.sgc-6}[588 (1985). Cf. Snepp v.
United States, 444 U. S. 507, 509 & n. 3, 100 ]{.sgc-6}[S. Ct. 763, 765
& n. 3, 62 L. Ed. 2d 704 (1980).]{.sgc-6}

[But the Indianapolis ordinance, unlike our hypothetical statute, is not
neutral with respect to viewpoint. The ban on distribution of works
containing coerced performances is limited to pornography; coercion is
irrelevant if the work is not "pornography, " and we have held the
definition of "pornography" to be defective root and branch. A
legislature might replace "pornography" in s 16-3(g)(4) with "any film
containing explicit sex" or some similar expression, but even the
broadest severability clause does not permit a federal court to rewrite
as opposed to excise. Rewriting is work for the legislature of
Indianapolis. Cf. Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 95 S. Ct. 1373, 43 L.
Ed. 2d 688 (1975); Califano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76, 99 S. Ct. 2655,
61 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1979).]{.font4}

[The offense of forcing pornography on unwilling recipients is harder to
assess. Many kinds of forcing (such as giving texts to students for
translation) may themselves be protected speech. Rowan v. Post Office,
397 U. S. 728, 90 S. Ct. 1484, 25 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1970), shows that a
state may permit people to insulate themselves from categories of
speech---in Rowan sexual mail---but that the government must leave the
decision about what items are forbidden in the hands of the potentially
offended recipients. See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S.
60, 103 ]{.font4}[S. Ct. 2875, 77 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1983) (the government
may not define for itself a category of constitutionally protected but
sexual speech that may not be mailed). Exposure to sex is not something
the government may prevent, see Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422
U. S. 205, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975). We therefore could
not save the offense of "forcing" by redefining "pornography" as all
sexually-offensive speech or some related category. The statute needs a
definition of "forcing" that removes the government from the role of
censor. See also Planned Parenthood Ass'n, supra, holding that the
"captive audience" problem does not permit a government to discriminate
on account of the speaker's message.]{.sgc-6}

[The section creating remedies for injuries and assaults attributable to
pornography also is salvageable in principle, although not by us. The
First Amendment does not prohibit redress of all injuries caused by
speech. Injury to reputation is redressed through the law of libel,
which is constitutional subject to strict limitations. Cases such as
Brandenburg v. Ohio and NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware hold that a state
may not penalize speech that does not cause immediate injury. But we do
not doubt that if, immediately after the Klan's rally in Brandenburg, a
mob had burned to the ground the house of a nearby black person, that
person could have recovered damages from the speaker who whipped the
crowd into a frenzy. All of the Justices assumed in Claiborne Hardware
that if the threats in Charles Evers's incendiary speech had been a
little less veiled and had led directly to an assault against a person
shopping in a store owned by a white merchant, the victim of the assault
and even the merchant could have recovered damages from the
speaker.]{.font4}

[The law of libel has the potential to muzzle the press, which led to
New York Times v. Sullivan. See also Oilman v. Evans, 750 F. 2d 970,
994-98 (D. C. Cir. 1984) (en banc) (Bork, J., concurring). A law
awarding damages for assaults caused by speech also has the power to
muzzle the press, and again courts would place careful limits on the
scope of the right. Certainly no damages could be awarded unless the
harm flowed directly from the speech and there was an element of intent
on the part of the speaker, as in Sullivan and Brandenburg.]{.font4}

[Much speech is dangerous. Chemists whose work might help someone build
a bomb, political theorists whose papers might start political movements
that lead to riots, speakers whose ideas attract violent protesters, all
these and more leave loss in their wake. Unless the remedy is very
closely confined, it could be more dangerous to speech than all the
libel judgments in history. The constitutional requirements for a valid
recovery for assault caused by speech might turn out to be too rigorous
for any plaintiff to meet. \[4\] But the Indianapolis ordinance requires
the complainant to show that the attack was "directly caused by specific
pornography" (s 16-3(g)(7) ), and it is not beyond the realm of
possibility that a state court could construe this limitation in a way
that would make the statute constitutional. We are not authorized to
prevent the state from trying.]{.font4}

[Again, however, the assault statute is tied to "pornography, " and we
cannot find a sensible way to repair the defect without seizing power
that belongs elsewhere. Indianapolis might choose to have no ordinance
if it cannot be limited to viewpoint-specific harms, or it might choose
to extend the scope to all speech, just as the law of libel applies to
all speech. An attempt to repair this ordinance would be nothing but a
blind guess.]{.font4}

[No amount of struggle with particular words and phrases in this
ordinance can leave anything in effect. The district court came to the
same conclusion. Its judgment is therefore AFFIRMED.]{.font4}

[SWYGERT, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.]{.font4}

[I concur in Parts I, II, and III of the court's opinion except for the
following strictures. Although raised in the district court, neither
ripeness nor abstention was made an issue on appeal. Given that fact, I
believe both are pseudo-issues and this court need not treat them sua
sponte. True, some of the intervenors have discussed abstention in their
briefs; but we are without the benefit of the views of the real parties
at interest in this case on either issue. More importantly, a discussion
and resolution of these issues are quite unnecessary to the disposition
of this appeal.]{.font4}

[I also believe that the majority's questionable and broad assertions
regarding how human behavior can be conditioned by certain teachings and
beliefs (see ante at 328-329, 330) are unnecessary. For even if this
court accepts the City of Indianapolis' basic contention that
pornography does condition unfavorable responses to women, the ordinance
is still unconstitutional.]{.font4}

[As to Part IV of the opinion, I agree that the ordinance is
unconstitutional on first amendment grounds and that there is no need to
discuss vagueness or prior restraint. I do, however, disassociate myself
from the extensive statements with respect to how the Indianapolis City
Council could fashion an ordinance dealing with pornography that might
pass constitutional muster. Indianapolis has asked us to sever the
ordinance and save those parts that are not unconstitutional, if we can.
All then that this court is required to do is to rule that the ordinance
is not severable. Statements regarding which portions of the ordinance
may be constitutional are merely advisory and are not the function of
this court.]{.font4}

supra, at 17-18 (note omitted, emphasis in original). See also Andrea
Dworkin,]{.font4} [Pornography: Men Possessing Women]{.font4} [(1981). A
national commission in Canada recently adopted a similar rationale for
controlling pornography. Special Commission on Pornography and
Prostitution, 1]{.font4} [Pornography and Prostitution in
Canada]{.font4} [49-59 (Canadian Government Publishing Centre
1985).]{.font4}

[2.     MacKinnon's article collects empirical work that supports this
proposition. The social science studies are very difficult to interpret,
however, and they conflict. Because much of the effect of speech comes
through a process of socialization, it is difficult to measure
incremental benefits and injuries caused by particular speech. Several
psychologists have found, for example, that those who see violent,
sexually explicit films tend to have more violent thoughts. But how
often does this lead to actual violence? National commissions on
obscenity here, in the United Kingdom, and in Canada have found that it
is not possible to demonstrate a direct link between obscenity and rape
or exhibitionism. The several opinions in Miller v. California discuss
the U. S. commission. See also Report of the Committee on Obscenity and
Film Censorship 61-95 (Home Office, Her Majesty's Stationery Office,
1979); Special Committee on Pornography and Prostitution, 1]{.font4}
[Pornography and Prostitution in Canada]{.font4} [71-73, 95-103
(Canadian Government Publishing Centre, 1985). In saying that we accept
the finding that pornography as the ordinance defines it leads to
unhappy consequences, we mean only that there is evidence to this
effect, that this evidence is consistent with much human experience, and
that as judges we must accept the legislative resolution of such
disputed empirical questions. See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
184-87, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 2930-31, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976) (opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ. ).]{.font4}

[3.     Indianapolis briefly argues that Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.
S. 250, 72 S. Ct. 725, 96 L. Ed. 919 (1952), which allowed a state to
penalize "group libel, " supports the ordinance. In Collin v. Smith,
supra, 578 F. 2d at 1205, we concluded that cases such as New York Times
v. Sullivan had so washed away the foundations of Beauharnais that it
could not be considered authoritative. If we are wrong in this, however,
the case still does not support the ordinance. It is not clear that
depicting women as subordinate in sexually explicit ways, even combined
with a depiction of pleasure in rape, would fit within the definition of
a group libel. The well received film]{.font4} [Swept Away]{.font4}
[used explicit sex, plus taking pleasure in rape, to make a political
statement, not to defame. Work must be an insult or slur for its own
sake to come within the ambit of Beauharnais, and a work need not be
scurrilous at all to be "pornography" under the ordinance.]{.font4}
