FULL DISCLOSURE

This book covers a period of approximately four years, during most of
which my life was a roller coaster and many pledges of anonymity were
required, particularly from men who wrecked their family’s lives and
women whose lives I wrecked. In order to compress it into a manageable
length, reduce the complexity, get at the truth of relationships, and
preserve anonymity, incidents, people, locations, and situations were
moved, removed, compounded, or compressed, and certain identifying
details, including names, have been changed. If you are reading this and
believe you recognize yourself, think again. Your story is the same as
that of most others in this book: You cheated and got caught.

DEDICATION

_T_o my mother and father.

They say a parent’s love is unconditional.

Let’s hope that’s still true after you read this book.

—RAINER WERNER FASSBINDER

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[image] WARNING

The following pages contain one of the most terrifying and obscene words
in the English language: _commitment_. Specifically the type of
commitment that often precedes or follows love and sex.

A lack of commitment, too much commitment, a poorly chosen commitment,
and misunderstandings about commitment have led to murders, suicides,
wars, and a whole lot of grief.

They have also led to this book, which is an attempt to figure out where
so many people go wrong, again and again, when it comes to relationships
and marriage—and if there’s a better way to live, love, and make love.

This, however, is not a journey that was undertaken for journalistic
purposes. It is a painfully honest account of a life crisis that was
forced on me as a consequence of my own behavior. Like most personal
journeys, it starts in a place of darkness, confusion, and foolishness.

As such, it requires sharing a lot of things I’m not proud of—and a few
things I feel like I should regret a whole lot more than I actually do.
Because, unfortunately, I am not the hero in this tale. I am the
villain.

WARNING FOR INGRID

If you are reading this, please stop now.

Do NOT turn the page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Ingrid,

If this is you, really, don’t read this.

Don’t you have email to check or something? Or have you seen the video
with that cat who’s doing a human-like thing? It’s hilarious--maybe you
should watch it. This book isn’t very good anyway. I’ve written others
that are much better. Go read one of those.

Seriously, stop reading now. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.

_E_very family has a skeleton in the closet.

You may know your family’s skeleton. You may even be that skeleton. Or
you may think that your family is different, that it’s the exception,
that you’re one of the lucky ones with a perfect set of parents and no
dark family secrets. If so, then you just haven’t opened the right
closet door yet.

For most of my life, I, too, believed I was one of the normal ones. But
then I found the right closet door.

It was in my father’s room. The door was white, with chipped paint along
the outer edge and a brass doorknob burnished by my father’s large hand.
I twisted the knob, emboldened by the hope of finding pornography, my
hand over the mark of my father’s.

I was a late-teenage virgin, my parents were out, and I craved the
female skin I so desperately lacked access to in real life. I’d found a
_Playboy_ and a _Penthouse_ in my father’s magazine stack before, so it
stood to reason that in a deeper recess of his room, there existed a
superior form of pornography: the kind that moves. Real porn.

In the back of his closet, beneath rows of blue cotton-polyester dress
shirts with monogrammed pockets, dulled nearly white from years of
washing, I found three brown grocery bags filled with VHS tapes. I sat
on the floor and examined each one meticulously, careful to return them
in the exact reverse order in which I’d removed them.

There were no videos labeled as porn, but I knew my father wouldn’t be
that stupid with my mother around. So I set aside all the unmarked
tapes. Since I was never allowed to have a television set of my own, I
brought the videos into the family room, where there was a small TV and
VCR, old presents from an old uncle.

I felt like I was about to explode.

I loaded the first video, and was disappointed to find a Dizzy Gillespie
jazz concert recorded off PBS. I pressed fast-forward, hoping it was
just camouflage for a nubile blonde-on-blonde scene. But what came next
was an episode of _Newhart,_ followed by _Masterpiece Theatre_. It was
spectacularly unmasturbatory.

The next tape was a recording of _The Philadelphia Story,_ followed by a
tennis match, and then nothing but static.

I placed the third videotape into the VCR and watched it sink slowly
into the machine. I pressed play, and as soon as I saw what was on that
tape, my excitement instantly drained, my skin went cold, and my image
of my father as a meek, passive businessman changed forever.

I saw images I didn’t even know existed in this world.

And suddenly, as if I’d accidentally opened a theater curtain to reveal
the rigging, I realized that the reality of my family was very different
from the façade.

“Promise you won’t tell anyone, not even your brother or your father,”
my mother instructed when I asked her about what I’d found.

“I promise,” I reassured her.

And I never told anyone what I learned that day about my father’s secret
life.

That is, until that secret became an acid, corroding my relationships.
Until it burned straight through my sense of right and wrong, leaving me
alone and despised. Until it landed me in a psychiatric institution,
where I was told that for my own sanity, freedom, and happiness, I
needed to break my promise and reveal the contents of that tape.

And so I faced a decision: How far would I go to protect my parents? Is
it better to betray the people responsible for my existence or to betray
that existence itself?

It is a decision that everyone, at some point in life, must make.

Most make the wrong one.

Maybe your dad is living a double life. Maybe your mom is. Maybe one of
them is secretly gay or cross-dressing or having an affair or paying for
hookers or going to strip clubs or watching Internet porn or just not in
love. Maybe both are. Maybe it’s not your parents, but you or the person
you love. But somewhere, there is a skeleton. And that skeleton has a
penis. And it will fuck your life.

_A_cross the aisle from me on the plane is a thin girl with black hair.
She could be anywhere from seventeen to twenty-three. And she has _it:_
dark eyeliner, fake lashes, a small round tattoo on her lower back, pink
headphones, and the permanent pout of someone who is angry at Dad but
will fuck any insensitive asshole who reminds her of Dad.

Next to me is a middle-aged woman with large imitation designer
sunglasses and a sundress showing milky white cleavage. In just twenty
minutes of conversation, and with the artful positioning of a
complimentary airline blanket, maybe I could have my hand inside there.

In front of me is a thin redhead with a beat-up face. Probably an
alcoholic. Not my type, but I would.

Inside my head, there is a map. And on that map, there is a small LED
bulb marking where every reasonably attractive or slightly sexually
compelling female is sitting. Before the plane has hit cruising
altitude, I have already thought of ways to approach each one, stripped
her naked, imagined her blow-job technique, and fucked her in the
bathroom or the rental car or her bedroom that night.

This is it: the last time I’m allowed to lust, the last time I’m allowed
to even entertain the thought of sleeping with a new woman. And my mind
is going crazy. I’m attracted to everyone. Not that I ever wasn’t, but
this time it hurts somewhere deep—in the core of who I am, of my
identity, of my reason for living.

I have nothing with me: no computer, no cell phone, no technology. They
are not allowed where I’m going. It feels liberating to be alone with my
thoughts—most of which involve debating whether to start a conversation
with the aforementioned, possibly jailbait girl in the row to my right
or the pock-faced redhead in front of me.

When the plane eases to a stop at the gate, a bespectacled man stands up
and makes his way to the aisle. He looks the black-haired girl up and
down. He is not hitting on her; he has stared at her too long for that.
He’s capturing the image, imprinting it in his memory to save it for
later, when he can use it.

Why am I putting myself through this? I wonder. This is normal male
behavior. That guy’s probably worse than I am.

As I walk through the terminal, I pull a folded piece of paper out of my
pocket: _Your driver will meet you as soon as you pass security. He will
be wearing a badge with a_ D, _so as not to identify where you are
going._

Suddenly, a guy in his twenties—at least six feet tall, muscular, square
jawed, basically the opposite of what I see when I look in the
mirror—freezes in front of me. His mouth drops open, like he’s seen a
ghost. I know what’s about to happen, and I want to get rid of him. He
is not my driver.

“Oh my god, are you . . .”

For some reason, he can’t seem to get the next words out of his mouth. I
wait for him to spit it out, but nothing happens.

“Yeah,” I tell him.

Silence.

“Well, nice to meet you. I have to go meet a friend.” Fuck, that’s a
lie. I swore to stop lying. Lies just roll off the tongue so much easier
than the truth sometimes.

“I read your book,” he says.

“Just recently?” I ask, for some reason. Walking away from people who
show interest is not one of my strong points. That’s why I’m here. Along
with the lying.

“No, three years ago.”

“That’s great.” He doesn’t look like the kind of guy who ever needed my
advice.

“I met my wife because of you. I owe you everything.”

“That’s great,” I say again. I think about the prospect of marrying
someone, of spending the rest of my life with her, of not being allowed
to fuck anyone else, of her aging and losing interest in sex and me
still not being able to fuck anyone else. And the next words just slip
out of my mouth: “Are you happy?”

“Oh yeah, totally,” he says. “Seriously. I read _The Game_ while I was
in the Army in Iraq, and it really helped me.”

“Do you plan on having kids?” I’m not sure what I’m doing. I think I’m
trying to scare him. I want him to show a little fear or hesitancy or
doubt, just to prove to myself that I’m not crazy.

“My wife’s actually about to give birth to our son,” he says. “I’m
flying home to see her.”

His answer hits me right where it hurts: in my self-esteem. Here I am,
incapable of having a relationship and starting a family, and this guy
read some book I wrote on picking up women and three years later he’s
got his entire life figured out.

I make my excuses and leave him standing there, no doubt thinking, He’s
much shorter than I imagined.

On the other side of security, I see a man with a gray ring of hair
around his head and a badge with a _D_ on it. He must see all kinds of
people rolling off the plane, either half dead or wasted or trying hard
to pretend they’re a normal adult, which is, I think, what I’m doing.

I feel like an impostor. There are people who need to go to this Level 1
psychiatric hospital because without it they are going to die. They’re
going to drink or snort or inject themselves to death.

All I did was cheat on my girlfriend.

LOS ANGELES, SIX MONTHS EARLIER

They say that when you meet someone and feel like it’s love at first
sight, run in the other direction. All that’s happened is that your
dysfunction has meshed with their dysfunction. Your wounded inner child
has recognized their wounded inner child, both hoping to be healed by
the same fire that burned them.

In fairy tales, love strikes like lightning. In real life, lightning
burns. It can even kill you.

My girlfriend is sitting on the floor of the guesthouse where we live,
packing to go with me to Chicago today. It’s her birthday. She’s going
to meet my family.

I look at her and appreciate every inch of her, inside and out. “I’m
excited, babe,” Ingrid says. She is pure joy, pulling me out of my dark,
solipsistic world every morning. She was born in Mexico, but to a German
father, and somehow ended up living in America and looking like a petite
Russian blonde. And so she embodies all the elements: the intensity of
fire, the strength of earth, the playfulness of water, the delicacy of
air.

“I know. Me too.”

I try to push the night before out of my head. There is no evidence of
it anywhere; I made sure of that. I showered. I checked the interior of
the car. I inspected every item of my clothing for stray hairs. The only
thing I can’t clean is my conscience.

“Should I bring these shoes?”

“It’s only five days. How many pairs do you need?”

Sometimes I get annoyed by how long it takes her to get ready, the
amount of clothing she needs to pack for even the shortest trips, the
way her high heels prevent us from walking more than a few blocks when
we go out. But deep down, I love her femininity. I am a slob and she
gives me grace. When I told her last night that I had to go see Marilyn
Manson, a musician I’d written a book with, about a new project, I
looked into the hazel-green of her eyes and I saw love, happiness,
innocence, peace.

Yet still I went through with it.

“So how was last night?” she asks as she struggles with the zipper of
her suitcase.

“It was kind of frustrating. We didn’t get much work done.” That’s for
sure.

As she places a small, confident hand on top of the overstuffed bag and
pushes the two rows of zipper teeth into contact, I can’t help but think
of two separate lives being forced together—and how, if just one element
pops out of place, everything starts to fall off the tracks.

“Aw, babe, you can sleep on my lap on the plane, if you want.”

She is reliving her mother’s relationship with her cheating father. I am
reliving my father’s secret sex life. We are repeating a pattern handed
down by generations of lying, cheating assholes and the poor fools who
trust them.

“Thank you,” I tell her. “I love you.” At least I think I love her. But
can you really love someone if you just fucked one of her friends in the
parking lot of a church, and now six hours later you’re lying to her
about it? My mind is so clouded with guilt, I don’t know anymore.
Somehow, I doubt it.

There comes a time in a man’s life when he looks around and realizes
he’s made a mess of everything. He’s dug a hole for himself so deep that
not only can’t he get out, but he doesn’t even know which way is up
anymore.

And that hole for me is, and has always been, relationships. Not just
because I cheated on Ingrid, but because yet another fairy tale is
teetering on the brink of an unhappy ending.

The last fairy tale concluded with my ex locking herself in her
apartment with a gun, and yelling that she was going to splatter her
brains all over the wall and I shouldn’t go to her funeral.

But this one is different. Ingrid isn’t crazy, she isn’t jealous, she
isn’t controlling, she’s never cheated on me, and she’s talented and
independent, working in a real estate office by day and designing
swimsuits by night. I’m ruining this one all by myself.

And that’s because I am the king of ambivalence.

When I’m single, I want to be in a relationship. When I’m in a
relationship, I miss being single. And worst of all, when the
relationship ends and my captor-lover finally moves on, I regret
everything and don’t know what I want anymore.

I’ve gone through this cycle enough times to realize that, at this rate,
I’m going to grow old alone: no wife, no kids, no family. I’ll die and
it will be weeks before the smell gets strong enough that someone finds
me. And all the shit I spent my lifetime accumulating will be thrown in
the trash so someone else can occupy the space I wasted. I’ll have left
nothing behind, not even debt.

But what’s the alternative?

Most married people I know don’t seem to be any happier. One day Orlando
Bloom, an actor I’d written a _Rolling Stone_ profile about, came over
to visit. At the time, he was married to one of the world’s most
successful and beautiful women, Victoria’s Secret supermodel Miranda
Kerr, making him one of the most envied men on the planet. And the first
thing out of his mouth? “I don’t know if marriage is worth it. I don’t
know why anyone does it. I mean, I want romance and I want to be with
someone, but I just don’t think it works.”

My other married friends haven’t fared much better. Some even seem
content, but after a little probing they admit to feeling frustrated.
Several cope by being unfaithful, others white-knuckle it, many
surrender passively to their fate, and a few simply live in denial. Even
the rare friends who’ve remained happy in their marriages admit, when
pressed, to being unfaithful at least once.

We expect love to last forever. Yet as many as 50 percent of marriages
and even more remarriages end in divorce. Among those who are married,
only 38 percent actually describe themselves as happy in that state. And
90 percent of couples report a decrease in marital satisfaction after
having their first child. Speaking of which, more than 3 percent of
babies are not actually fathered by the male parent who thinks he did.*

Unfortunately, it’s only getting worse. Thanks to technology, we now
have more dating and hook-up options than at any other time in human
history, with countless desperate men and women just a click or swipe
away, making fidelity—or even committing in the first place—yet more of
a challenge. In a recent Pew Research survey, four out of ten people
believed that marriage was an obsolete institution.

Maybe, then, the problem isn’t just me. Perhaps I’ve been trying to
conform to an outdated and unnatural social norm that doesn’t truly
meet—and has never met—the needs of both men and women equally.

So I stand here, packing for Chicago, riddled with guilt and confusion,
with one foot in the best relationship I’ve ever had and one foot out of
it, wondering: Is it even natural to be faithful to one person for life?
And if it is, how do I keep the passion and romance from fading over
time? Or are there alternatives to monogamy that will lead to better
relationships and greater happiness?

Several years ago, I wrote a book called _The Game_ about an underground
community of pickup artists I joined in search of an answer to the
biggest question plaguing my lonely life at the time: Why don’t women I
like ever like me back?

In the pages that follow, I attempt to solve a much tougher life
dilemma: What should I do _after_ she likes me back?

Like love itself, the path to answer this question will be anything but
logical. The unintended consequences of my infidelity will lead me to
free-love communes, to modern-day harems, and to scientists, swingers,
sex anorexics, priestesses, leather families, former child actors,
miracle healers, murderers, and, most terrifying of all, my mother. It
will challenge and ultimately revolutionize everything I thought I knew
about relationships—and myself.

If you’re interested in getting more out of this odyssey for yourself,
notice the words and concepts that most excite or repel you. Each gut
reaction tells a story. It is a story about who you are and what you
believe. Because, all too often, the things that we’re the most
resistant to are precisely what we need. And the things we’re most
scared to let go of are exactly the ones we most need to relinquish.

At least, that will be the case with me.

This is the story of discovering that every truth I’ve desperately clung
to, fought for, fucked for, and even loved for is wrong.

Appropriately, it begins in a modern-day insane asylum, sometime before
I escaped against medical advice . . .

A hairy man in green hospital scrubs takes my luggage, stretches a pair
of latex gloves over his hammy fists, and starts searching for
contraband.

“We don’t allow books here.”

The only other place I’ve been where books are confiscated is North
Korea. Taking away books is a tactic of dictators and others who don’t
want people to have an original thought. Even in prison, inmates are
allowed to have books.

But this is my punishment, I tell myself. I’m here to be retrained, to
learn how to be a decent human being. I’ve hurt people. I deserve to be
in this hospital, this prison, this asylum, this convalescent home for
weak men and women who can’t say no.

They treat all addictions here: alcohol, drugs, sex, food, even
exercise. Too much of anything can be a bad thing. Even love.

Their specialty is love addiction.

But I am not a love addict. I wish I were. That sounds much more
socially acceptable. There’s probably a special place in heaven for love
addicts, along with all the other martyrs.

The attendant drops my nail clippers, tweezers, razor, and razor blades
into a manila envelope. “I’m going to have to take these too.”

“Can I shave first? I didn’t have time to shave this morning.”

“New arrivals can’t use razors for three days while on suicide watch.
After that, you need your psychiatrist’s permission.”

“But how can you commit suicide with nail clippers?” I’m not very good
with rules. That’s another reason I’m here. “Mine don’t even have a file
attached.”

He is silent.

You can’t fix most problems with rules, any more than you can with laws.
They’re too inflexible. They break. Common sense is flexible. And I’m
clearly in a place devoid of it. “If I wanted to kill myself, I’d just
use my belt. And you didn’t take that.”

I say it with a smile, to show I’m not angry. I just want to let him
know that this system doesn’t work. He looks me up and down, says
nothing, then writes something in my folder. I’m never getting that
razor back.

“Come with me,” insists a green-smocked woman—rail thin and sinewy, with
unkempt blond hair and sun-damaged skin. She introduces herself as a
nurse technician and leads me to a private room.

She wraps a blood pressure cuff around my arm. “We need to take your
vitals four times a day for the next three days,” she says. Her eyes are
dull, the words mechanical. This is what she does all day, every day.

“Why is that?” I ask. Too many questions. I can tell they don’t like
them here. But I’m just trying to understand. This isn’t how I thought
things were supposed to go. When I visited rehab to see a rock guitarist
I was writing a book with, it seemed like a cross between a country club
and overnight camp.

“We get a lot of people withdrawing and we want to make sure they’re
going to be okay,” she explains. She listens to my pulse and lets me
know my blood pressure is high.

Of course it’s fucking high, I want to tell her. I’ve never been so
uncomfortable in my life. You’re taking away all my shit and treating me
like I’m going to die. Withdrawing from sex isn’t going to kill me.

But I stay quiet. And I submit. Like a good cheater.

She gives me a pager I’m supposed to wear at all times, in case they
need me in the nursing station. Then she thrusts one form after another
in front of me—patient rights, privacy, liability, and the rules. More
fucking rules. One paragraph forbids me from having sex with any
patient, nurse, or staff member. The next says that patients may not
wear bikinis, tank tops, or shorts—and must wear bras at all times.

“So I have to put on a bra?” I joke, futilely trying once more to show
how stupid their rules are.

“It’s kind of silly,” the nurse concedes, “but we have sex addicts in
here.”

The words escape from her mouth with scorn and fear, as if these sex
addicts are not normal patients but creepy predators to beware of. And
suddenly I realize that the alcoholics and junkies have nothing on me:
They harm only their own bodies. I am after the bodies of others. I’m
the worst of the worst. Other addicts can’t find drugs in rehab, but my
temptation is here. It is everywhere. And anyone in flirting distance
must remain vigilant, lest I prey on them.

“Do you have any suicidal thoughts?” she asks.

“No.”

She clicks a box on the computer and a form appears titled _Promise Not
to Commit Suicide_.

She thrusts a small digital pad and a stylus toward me and asks me to
sign the form.

“What are you going to do if I kill myself? Kick me out for lying?”

She says nothing, but I notice her dig the nail of her index finger into
her thumb. I think I’m annoying her. It’s the questions. The fucking
questions. They don’t like them here. It’s because questions are
powerful: The right question can expose the flaws in the system.

But I sign. And I submit. Like a good cheater.

She looks over my file on the computer, sees something that evidently
surprises her, then turns the monitor away from me and quickly types a
few words. I’ve only been here twenty minutes, and on relatively good
behavior considering, and I’m already in the doghouse. And that’s fine
with me, because so far I hate the whole process. This is not about
making me better. This is about covering their own asses from lawsuits,
so they can tell the victim’s family, “Well, he promised us he wouldn’t
hang himself. See, we have his signature right here, so it’s not our
fault if he lied to us.”

“Do you have any homicidal thoughts?” she asks.

“No.” And in that moment, I have a homicidal thought. It’s like saying,
“Don’t think of a pink elephant.”

She moves to the next question. “What are you here for?”

“Cheating.”

She says nothing. I think about that word. It sounds lame. I’m in a
fucking mental hospital because I couldn’t say no to a new sex partner.
So I add the other reason I’m there: “And I guess to learn how to have a
healthy relationship.”

I think of Ingrid, whose heart I broke, whose friends threatened to kill
me, who never did anything wrong but love me.

The nurse looks up to face me. It is the first time she’s made eye
contact. I see something soften. I’m no longer a pervert. I’ve said the
magic R word: _relationship_.

Her lips part and moisten; her whole demeanor is different now. She
actually wants to help me. “Of course,” she says, “the first part of
that is finding someone to date who’s healthy.”

“I found that person,” I sigh. “She’s totally healthy. That’s what made
me realize it’s just me.”

She smiles sympathetically and continues looking through my intake
folder. I ask her if she thinks I’m really an addict. “I’m not an
addiction specialist,” she says. “But if you’re cheating on your
relationship, if you’re visiting porn sites, or if you’re masturbating,
that’s sex addiction.”

She opens a drawer, removes a red square of paper, and writes my first
name and last initial on it in black marker. Then she slips it into a
small plastic sleeve and loops a long piece of white string through it.
It’s the ugliest necklace I’ve ever seen.

“You’re in red two,” she says. “You’re required to wear your badge at
all times.”

“What does red two mean?”

“The tags are color coded. Red is for sex addicts. And the red two group
is in therapy with”—she pauses and flashes a brief, uncomfortable
smile—“Joan.”

I can’t tell whether it’s fear or pity in her expression, but for some
reason the name fills me with a crawling dread.

She then picks up a large poster board from the floor and holds it on
top of the desk, facing me. There are eight huge words on it:

JOY

PAIN

LOVE

ANGER

PASSION

FEAR

GUILT

SHAME

“This is called a check-in,” she says. “You’ll be required to check in
four times a day and report which emotions you’re feeling. Which ones
are you experiencing right now?”

I scan the display for crawling dread, for utter worthlessness, for
total confusion, for intense regret, for rule-hating frustration, for
the impulse to jump up and run away and change my name to Rex and move
to New Zealand forever.

“I can’t find my emotions on the list.”

“These are the eight basic emotions,” she explains with practiced
patience. “Every emotion belongs in one of these categories. So select
the ones you feel the most right now.”

I don’t get this. I feel like someone just made this shit up. It’s
completely arbitrary. It makes me feel . . .

“Anger.”

She types it in my file. I am now officially institutionalized. I feel
another emotion coming on.

“What’s the difference between guilt and shame?” I ask.

“Guilt is just about your behavior. Shame is about who you are.”

“And shame.” Lots of shame.

She leads me back to the reception desk, where I see a woman with her
arm in a blue fiberglass cast being led out of a nursing station:
another new arrival. She has pasty skin, blue-black hair, lots of
piercings, and the look of a vampire who seduces men to their doom. And
I’m instantly attracted.

From the other direction, an even more alluring woman, with long blond
hair pouring out of a pink baseball cap, saunters to the reception desk.
She’s wearing a tight black T-shirt that clings to every contour of her
body. And I think what I always think, what every man always thinks.
What was puberty for if not to think these thoughts? What is
testosterone for if not to feel a sudden rush of chemicals priming the
neuroreceptors in the medial preoptic area of the brain right now,
impelling me forward to action?

“What are you here for?” I ask the blonde. Her tag is blue.

“Love addiction,” she replies.

Perfect. I ask if she wants to get dinner.

Check-in: guilt.

And passion.

My roommate also has a red tag around his neck. As soon as I walk
through the door, he looks me up and down, and instantly a wave of
inferiority washes over me. He’s tan and muscular; I’m not. His face is
chiseled; mine is soft and weak. He was the most valuable player in a
soccer championship, if his T-shirt is to be believed; I was always
picked last for sports teams in school.

“I’m Adam,” he says and crushes my hand in his. He speaks with
confidence; my voice is nervous and fast.

“Neil.” I extricate my hand. “So what are you in for?” I ask with forced
ease. If I looked like Adam, I would have had girlfriends—or at least
some sort of sexual contact—in high school and probably wouldn’t be
lusting after every woman on the street, on the plane, in rehab, in a
fifty-yard radius of wherever I am. I’d have some fucking self-esteem.

“Neil, I’ll tell you.” He sits down on his bed and sighs. “I’m here for
the same reason you are, the same reason every guy is: I got caught.”

Or maybe I still wouldn’t have self-esteem. Suddenly, I like him. He
speaks my language.

The room is sparse: three small cots, three locking wardrobes, and three
cheap plastic alarm clocks. I claim a bed and a closet as Adam tells his
story. The bed is so low to the ground that his knees are almost at his
chest.

Adam is a hardworking, God-fearing, patriotic American man clipped right
out of a 1950s magazine ad for aftershave. Married his college
sweetheart, bought a small house in Pasadena, sells insurance, has two
kids and a dog, goes to church on Sundays.

“But my wife,” he’s saying, “she doesn’t take care of herself. She lies
around the house all day and does nothing. I come home from work and she
just sits there reading a magazine. I’ll ask if she wants to hear the
five-minute version of my day and she’ll say, ‘No thanks.’ She doesn’t
even have dinner ready for the kids.” He drops his chin into his hands
and takes a deep breath into his probably perfect athlete’s lungs. “It’s
not that I want her to be a housewife or anything, but I’m exhausted. So
I’ll make dinner for everyone and she doesn’t even clean up. You know,
Neil, I call her every afternoon and tell her I love her. I send her
flowers. I do everything to show her I care.”

“But do you care or are you just doing a duty?”

“That’s just it.” He anxiously twists his wedding band. “I play soccer
and help run the local leagues, and there’s this woman who started
coaching one of the teams, and there was something there between us. It
was maybe seven months before anything happened, but when it did, let me
tell you, Neil, I’m not kidding, it was the best sex I’ve ever had. It
was real passion and it developed into real love. But then my wife hired
a private eye and that was the end of that.”

Perhaps marriage is like buying a house: You plan to spend the rest of
your life there, but sometimes you want to move—or at least spend a
night in a hotel. “So if you were so happy with this other woman and so
unhappy with your wife, why didn’t you just get divorced?”

“It’s not that easy. I have a mature, established relationship with my
wife. And we have children, and you have to think about them.” He pushes
himself off the bed and rises to his feet. “Wanna keep talking while we
jog?”

I look at his legs, built by some super genetic stock and, probably, by
a strict dad who loved him only when he scored goals. It would take me
four steps to keep up with just one of his.

“That’s all right. I have dinner plans.”

“See you around, then.” He starts to leave the room, then turns back.
“Anyone warn you about Joan yet?”

“Joan?” And then I remember.

“She runs our group. A real ballbuster. You’ll see.”

And off Adam goes—healthy, wholesome, and fucked.

In the cafeteria, there’s no sugar or caffeine, just food that won’t
make anyone high. At a table in the corner, seven women with eating
disorders sit with a staff counselor, who makes sure they swallow their
allotted calories and don’t purge in the bathroom.

So far I haven’t seen any women with red tags. Evidently, women have
eating disorders, men have sex addiction. I suppose both share the same
obsession: women’s bodies.

I sit down next to the love addict, who’s with the broken-armed vampire
from reception. Turns out they’re roommates. The love addict introduces
herself as Carrie; the vampire as Dawn, an alcoholic and indiscriminate
drug fiend. Whenever Dawn needs more sugar-free dessert or caffeine-free
coffee, Carrie gets it for her, until the counselor from the eating
table walks over.

“Stop getting food for other people,” he reprimands her. “That’s
codependency, and it’s against the rules here. No more caretaking! Got
it?”

After he leaves, Carrie gives me a helpless look. “But her arm’s broken!
What am I supposed to do?”

“You’re enabling my cast addiction,” Dawn jokes. And we laugh as if
everything’s normal. But as we do, I look down and see the red tag
dangling over my solar plexus like a scarlet letter. And I start to
falter, to get nervous, to wonder if they’ve noticed that, of all the
people to talk to here, I’ve chosen them—the youngest ones, the most
attractive ones, the only two I shouldn’t be sitting with.

If they don’t know yet what this red badge means, they will know soon:
Keep away. This man is a pervert.

On a bulletin board outside the reception area, there’s a list of
twelve-step meetings taking place that night: Alcoholics Anonymous,
Narcotics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, Overeaters
Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Crystal Meth Anonymous, Co-Dependents
Anonymous. A menu of dysfunctions to choose from.

I’ve never been to any of these meetings, so I choose the most relevant:
Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous. It’s in the patient lounge, which serves
primarily as a library of tabletop puzzles to keep obsessive-compulsive
patients busy wasting their lives. In a circle of couches and chairs at
the far end of the room, there’s a group of three men and three women,
including Carrie, led by a sad but dignified gray-haired man with a
binder open in front of him. He looks like a newscaster who’s fallen on
hard times.

“My name is Charles, and I’m a codependent depressive sex addict with
PTSD and OCD,” he tells the group.

“Hi, Charles.”

“I was treated for sex addiction ten years ago and then relapsed two
months ago. Because I didn’t want to raise kids around my addiction,
I’ve passed up the chance to have children with my wife. We’re both too
old now, and I really regret that. And I’m scared for her to come for
family week, because I don’t want to lose her.”

When he’s finished, he looks to Carrie. She’s changed into another tight
T-shirt. This one says DAMAGED GOODS on it.

“My name is Carrie, and I’m a love addict and trauma survivor.” Hi,
Carrie. “I just got here today. I spent the last two years chasing after
an abusive guy who wasn’t even interested in me. If a guy gives me just
a little bit of attention, I get obsessed. I don’t feel pretty, and I
see him as a challenge. And because I want approval and love so much, I
have sex before I should—and a lot of times when I shouldn’t at all.”

The thought occurs before I can stop it: These groups are a great place
to meet women. Carrie is sitting here divulging the exact strategy by
which she can be seduced. There’s nothing a man with low self-esteem
loves more than a beautiful woman who doesn’t know she’s beautiful.

I need to control my mind. I suppose that’s why I’m here.

Next up is a man in his early fifties: gray hair, gray beard, slight
belly, red cheeks, like a skinnier, sex-addicted Santa Claus. He stares
at his stomach and slowly, reluctantly tells his story. “I started out
just going to strip clubs, but then I went to Tijuana and found this
whorehouse and started going there all the time.”

He sucks in a lungful of air like it’s cigarette smoke, and lets out the
saddest sigh I’ve ever heard. “And I got an STD.” He pauses, as if
considering whether to share the rest of the story, then squeezes his
eyes shut for a moment and shakes his head side to side. “And I haven’t
told my wife about it yet.” He waits for a reaction, but it’s so quiet
you could hear a syringe drop. “I’m going to have her come for family
week and tell her then, I guess. Twenty-five years of marriage, and the
whole house of cards is about to come tumbling down.”

He looks like his neck is in a guillotine and he’s waiting for the blade
to fall. No one seems to have much of a problem with cheating here, just
with getting caught. Many a man has shot himself in the head rather than
face up to the consequences of what he’s done in his secret life.

Yet the consequences are rarely death, violence, or prison. The
consequences are that other people will know about it, and they’ll have
feelings and emotions about it that he can’t control. Santa Claus’s wife
isn’t going to kill him. She’s just going to be really, really, really
pissed off. Lying is about controlling someone else’s reality, hoping
that what they don’t know won’t hurt you.

Suddenly I notice that everyone’s eyes are on me.

“My name is Neil.”

“Hi, Neil,” they all echo flatly.

And then I hesitate. If I check in as a sex addict, that could ruin my
chances with Carrie.

But I’m here to ruin my chances with Carrie. I’m here to ruin my chances
with everyone. If I have sex in rehab, then I’m really doomed.

But Carrie aside, am I even a sex addict? I’m a fucking man. Men like to
have sex. That’s what we do. Put a beautiful woman in a tight dress in a
bar on a Saturday night, and it’s like throwing raw meat into a den of
wolves.

But I ate the meat while I was in a relationship. And I lied to and hurt
someone who loves me, or loved me—I’m not sure which anymore. I suppose
that’s what addicts do: They want something so badly, they’re willing to
hurt others to get it.

“And I’m a sex and love addict.”

Okay, so I softened it a little.

Everyone is listening, no one is judging. They’ve all got their own
problems. “I never thought I’d be in a place like this. But I made some
bad decisions and I cheated on the woman I love. So I guess I’m here to
find out why I’d do something like that and hurt her so much. And
because I want to become healthy enough to have a committed
relationship, hopefully with her. I don’t want to end up destroying a
marriage and traumatizing my children because I cheated.”

Santa Claus shakes his head and his eyes well up with tears.

I stop there. I decide not to mention the other option I’m debating: to
just say, “Fuck it, this is my nature,” and not get in another
monogamous relationship, to be free to go out with who I want, when I
want.

Since adolescence, we’ve been trained as men—by our friends, by our
culture, by our biology—to desire women. It seems unreasonable to expect
us to just shut it off forever once we get married. Legs are long,
breasts are soft, and forever is a long time.

After everyone else shares, Charles asks if anyone is attending their
first meeting. I raise my hand and he passes around a coin for me. I’ve
seen friends who were junkies get these coins for sobriety and treat
them like Olympic gold medals. Now I’ve got one. I look at it. It means
nothing to me, except that today I’ve become one of them. One day sober.

Never in my lifetime did I think I’d be a patient in a place like this.
In fact, I always thought that I was normal, that I was lucky to have
parents who stayed together and never beat me, that my father’s secret
had nothing to do with me, that I had no use or time for therapists,
that I was a journalist who wrote about other people’s problems. I’m not
sure what made me finally realize I was the one who was crazy.

Maybe it was Rick Rubin.

PACIFIC OCEAN, FIVE MONTHS EARLIER

So let me get this straight: You love your girlfriend, but you went and
had sex with someone else?

Yes.

And you knew that would hurt her, so you lied to her about it?

Yes.

Well, look on the bright side: If she finds out and breaks up with you,
you’re not really in a relationship anyway. With all the lying, you’ve
been in your own world the whole time.

_Rick and I are paddleboarding in the Pacific Ocean. He’s one of the
best music producers in the world, and for some reason he’s taken me
under his wing. At first I thought he befriended me so I would write
about him in_ Rolling Stone, _but I soon realized that nothing could be
further from the truth. He doesn’t like to be written about, to go to
parties, or to be in any situation outside his comfort zone. Yet at the
same time, he has no problem telling bands like U2 that some new song
they’ve recorded sucks._

So do you think I should just tell her what happened?

Of course. If you’d committed to always telling her the truth in the
first place, you would have thought twice before cheating on her. So
start now, and maybe it’s not too late to include her in your
relationship.

I don’t think I can do it. It would hurt her too much.

Well, was it worth it?

Definitely not.

_Every other day for the last year, Rick and I have paddled from
Paradise Cove to Point Dume together and talked about our lives. He’s
older than me but faster, always a few strokes ahead. Shirtless, with a
long gray beard, he looks like some kind of water mystic leading a young
acolyte._

_Our paddles together are a far cry from my conversations with Rick a
few years ago. Back then, he was 135 pounds heavier and rarely got off
his couch. Every movement seemed like hard labor to him. Now, every day
he’s either working out, paddleboarding, or trying some new exercise
regimen. I’ve never seen anyone go through such a rapid transformation.
And today, I suppose he’s trying to help me do the same._

Do you know what kind of people can’t control their behavior, even when
they don’t enjoy that behavior anymore?

Weak people?

Addicts.

I don’t think I’m an addict. I’m just a guy. It’s not like I do this all
the time.

Spoken like a true crackhead. Didn’t you just get finished telling me
that you lie to the people you love to get your fix, that you don’t even
get high from it anymore but still do it?

Yes. But what if Ingrid just isn’t the right person for me? If she was,
maybe I wouldn’t cheat. She gets on my nerves sometimes, and she can be
really stubborn.

You had the same kind of complaints about your last girlfriend. When
things get hard for you, you start blaming the person you’re with. None
of this has anything to do with her. Just you. Can you see that?

I don’t know.

_He rolls his eyes._

_Sometimes I feel like I’m an experiment of Rick’s, that he gets off on
persuading people to do the exact opposite of what they enjoy, that this
is a sadistic attempt to see if he can make the guy who wrote_ The Game
_let go of the game._

I will go as far as to say you probably have never experienced a true
connection, sexually or otherwise, before in your life. Rehab may be
exactly what you need to cure your fear.

What fear?

That in a healthy monogamous relationship, you’re not enough for the
person you’re with.

_Either that or he’s actually trying to help me._

I’ll have to think about that.

You don’t have time to think. If you ever want to be truly happy in this
lifetime, you have to recognize that you’re using sex like a drug to
fill a hole. And that hole is your self-esteem. Deep down, you feel
unlovable. So you try to escape from that feeling by conquering new
women. And when you finally go too far and hurt Ingrid, all it’s going
to do is reinforce your original belief that you’re not worthy of love.

_As he speaks, Rick appears almost messianic. His eyes burn brightly and
he seems to be receiving the truth from some higher place, a place I’ve
never been. I’ve seen him get like this before—and when I ask him later
to repeat what he said, he usually can’t remember._

I see what you’re saying. But I also just like trying new things. I love
traveling, eating at different restaurants, and meeting new people. Sex
is the same: I like getting to know different women, experiencing what
they’re like in bed, meeting their friends and family, and having the
adventures and memories.

Fill the hole and have sex when you’re whole, then see how that feels.

Maybe you’re right. It wouldn’t hurt to try that.

There’s a place I know where you can go for sex addiction. It’s a
month-long program. If you go now—and write Ingrid from rehab, tell her
the truth, and explain that you’re dealing with your problem—I think
she’d forgive you.

I can’t go now. I have a couple of really big deadlines coming up.

If you got hit by a car today and you were in the hospital for a month,
you wouldn’t miss out on anything by not being able to write during that
time. That excuse is just the illness having free rein with you.
Nothing’s going to change until you take deliberate and committed action
to change it.

_I promise myself that I’ll be faithful to Ingrid from now on, that I’ll
make sure she never finds out what I did, and that I’ll prove to Rick
I’m not an addict. Yet at the same time, there’s a voice inside me,
telling me that somewhere out there, like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness
Monster, there are smart, attractive, and stable women who want
commitment without requiring sexual exclusivity._

Listen, there’s a lot of truth in what you’re saying. And I’m going to
think about it and try to do the right thing. But I really don’t think
I’m a sex addict. It’s not like I’m blowing all my money on hookers or
fondling altar boys or anything.

Maybe you’re not ready yet. Like a junkie, you need to hit rock bottom
first.

There are ten chairs pushed against the side and back walls of the room,
each filled with a broken man, including my roommate Adam. Charles, who
led the twelve-step meeting the previous night, is here. So is Santa
Claus, slumped in his chair, his forehead creased with stress, his eyes
cinched tight. He’s in the room in body only. His mind is elsewhere,
suffering. Against the front wall is a rolling chair, a desk, and a file
cabinet filled with the sins of countless sex addicts.

On the wall is a large chart titled “The Addiction Cycle,” with four
terms—_preoccupation, ritualization, acting out,_ and _shame &
despair_—arranged in a circle. Arrows point from one word to the next in
an endless loop.

[image]

As I’m studying it, the door swings open and a tall woman with a
pear-shaped body walks in. She has brown hair, unwashed and pulled back
in a tight bun. She’s wearing a loose-fitting flowered top over brown
slacks and flat shoes. The corners of her lips are pulled slightly
downward in a permanent frown. She looks the group over, careful not to
make eye contact with anyone or acknowledge his individuality. Whatever
the opposite of sex is, she embodies it.

She lands with a thud in the rolling chair. Sifting through a stack of
manila folders, she shows no tenderness, no humanity, no humor. She is
our doctor and judge, the stern mother we’ve been fucking women to try
to escape from and the bitter wife who’s caught us.

Her name is Joan. And her mere presence ripples through the flesh of
each man in the room like a violent chill.

“Have you completed your assignment?” she asks a man in his
mid-thirties. He’s thin and blond, with a sweet, boyish face, ruddy
cheeks, and the beginnings of an oddly incongruous potbelly.

“Yes,” he says nervously. “Should I read it?” His red name tag
identifies him as Calvin.

“Please.” There’s no warmth or caring in her voice, only authority and a
drip of condescension. In fact, everything she does and says is so
measured that her personality seems artificial, like a mask she puts on
before walking into a room to face ten male sex addicts. And she fears
that if she drops it, if she gives up any ground, she’ll lose control of
these predatory animals she must tame and civilize.

“These are the ways in which my sexual addiction has hurt my life,”
Calvin begins. “I lost my house and my brother. I booked a trip around
the world with him and snuck away to see escorts in almost every city.
I’ve spent a total of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars over
the course of my life on escorts.”

“Are you counting everything you’ve spent?”

“I think so.” He braces himself as if he’s about to be attacked.

“Did you include your Internet bill?”

“No.”

“Do you use the Internet to find escorts?”

“Yes.”

“Then include your Internet bill. And your phone bill, if you called any
of these women you dehumanized.” She spits out the last word like a
preacher damning him to hell. “Include the money you spent on taxis to
see these women and the money you spent on condoms and the entire cost
of any trip where you saw them.”

“Okay, then maybe it’s two hundred and fifty thousand?”

A quarter of a million dollars is still not enough for Joan. As she
pushes him to add up every penny even peripherally involved in the
pursuit of sex, I think about how I’ve made my living off my so-called
sex addiction. My sex addiction pays for my phone, rent, and health
insurance. It pays for breakfast, lunch, and dinner; for movies, books,
and the computer I’m writing on; for socks, underwear, and shoes. Fuck,
I couldn’t afford to be here getting treatment without it.

When I look back on my childhood, I see a malnourished nerd wearing
cheap black-rimmed plastic glasses, too big for my little face yet too
small for my gigantic ears. And I see greasy brown hair chopped
awkwardly short—at my request. I hated my curls. Everyone else had
straight hair and I wanted to fit in. Even my own mother called me a
follower.

My losing streak continued not just through high school—where my junior
prom date left the dance with another guy and my longest interactions
with attractive women were during haircuts—but through college and my
twenties. I sat on the sidelines, watching other people have fun.
Eventually I made that a full-time job and started writing profiles of
musicians for a living. When things got particularly lonely in the long
droughts between girlfriends and I craved female touch, I’d go to an
Asian massage parlor. And even there, I got the feeling they were making
fun of my awkwardness behind my back.

But one day, everything changed. I embedded myself with the world’s
greatest self-proclaimed ladies’ men, hoping to turn my losing streak
around. After living with them and traveling the world with them for two
years, I finally developed the confidence to talk to women I was
attracted to and, for the first time in my life, the ability to attract
them to me. The book I wrote about my education at the hands of these
unlikely Lotharios became so infamous that it eclipsed everything I’d
done before. And so my pursuit of sex didn’t destroy my life, it made my
career.

How frustrating, then, to find myself in rehab some five years later,
trying to unlearn everything I’ve spent so much time and energy
learning.

“Do you realize that you’re harming these women when you use their
bodies to masturbate with?” Joan admonishes Calvin. She senses he’s on
the verge of tears, then tries to bring him over the edge. “They don’t
care about you. These are hurt and abused women. And you’re reenacting
their childhood trauma. You are their father, their first boyfriend, the
predator who raped away their innocence.”

And that’s it. Calvin is done. His head rolls down and he covers his
eyes with his palms as the tears spill out. Victorious, Joan takes a
verbal lap around the room, asking different patients to report on what
their sexual addiction has cost them, breaking down each of their
defenses, stripping them of the last vestige of ego and pride they’ve
retained from any affair or adventure or transaction.

When a thin, laid-back patient with thick black hair and a cratered face
mentions a girl he had an affair with, Joan recoils and spends ten
minutes lecturing him on the use of the g-word. “As a therapist, when I
hear the word _girl,_ I have to automatically assume that you’re talking
about a minor. And I’m obliged to report that.”

The air in the room thickens with confusion and discomfort. Finally, the
accused replies, “I’m a sex addiction therapist also. I’ve been
practicing for fifteen years. And I have never heard that interpretation
of the word _girl_ before in my life.”

Joan raises her head like a cobra about to strike: “If I hear you use
that word again, I will report you. And you will not make it to your
sixteenth year as a CSAT.”

That shuts him up. Another man down.

A CSAT is a Certified Sex Addiction Therapist, a designation invented by
Patrick Carnes, the Johnny Appleseed of sex addiction. While working
with sex offenders in the seventies, he began to view sex as an
addiction like alcohol and he believed it could be treated with the same
twelve-step program. So in the decades that followed, he started
lecturing, writing books, setting up treatment centers, studying
thousands of sex fiends and their families, and crusading to get
psychiatrists to recognize sex addiction as a mental disorder.

On the wall over Joan’s desk, there’s a small framed photograph of Saint
Carnes himself in a majestic dark suit and striped tie, forehead shining
below his receding hairline like the halo of an angel,
wedding-band-consecrated left hand resting in the foreground. He’s
smiling crookedly and looking down beatifically on the room of sex
addicts prostrate before him.

Except for Calvin, who’s never had a serious girlfriend and is here
because he got a Brazilian hooker pregnant, every other sinner seems to
be in the room for cheating—some regularly for decades, others once or
twice. And so they come here, trying to work off the sins of the flesh
and hoping Saint Carnes can perform a miracle and save the family that
is both their greatest achievement and their greatest burden.

Looking at abject Adam and scared Santa Claus and penitent Charles, I
think: I need to fix this problem now. Because otherwise I’ll be right
back here like them after I’m married, fighting to keep my family
together.

When Joan releases us, I stand up to head to the cafeteria, but she
stops me. “You need to stay and sign some paperwork.” She makes no eye
contact.

Instead, she turns to her computer and pulls up my file, then studies it
carefully.

“So how long have you been taking Zoloft?” she asks.

“I’ve never taken Zoloft.”

“It says here in your file that you do.”

“Well, that’s probably a mistake. I’ve never taken any psychiatric
medication in my life.”

“So you don’t take Zoloft?” Her eyebrows rise incredulously and she
types into my file: “Denies taking Zoloft.”

It’s interesting how someone will believe a document more than they’ll
believe a human being—even though the words didn’t get on the document
by themselves. For the rest of my life and even after it, whenever
people dig through my records, they’ll think I have a chemical mood
imbalance because of this hack.

She closes my file, then calls up another document. I look over her
shoulder. The bold print at the top of the screen freezes my heart:
CELIBACY/ABSTINENCE CONTRACT_._

Evidently I’m about to become a priest.

She reads it sternly.

                 I WILL REFRAIN FROM THE FOLLOWING:

                 [image]  Masturbation

                 [image]  Implicit or explicit pornographic material

                 [image]  Flirtatious, seductive, romantic, or
suggestive comments or behavior

                 [image]  Seductive attire

                 [image]  Sexually overt or covert contact with another
person or myself

                 [image]  Secretive sexual fantasizing: I will report
objectifying, fantasizing, or obsessing to appropriate staff members

                 [image]  And cross-dressing.

“This contract is effective for twelve weeks,” she informs me.

“But I’m only supposed to be here for four weeks.”

She fixes her eyes on mine. Her pupils are brown and glassy, with as
much empathy as a snail shell. “This is for your own benefit. It takes
three months for your brain to return to normal after all the imbalances
caused by the constant high of sex.”

“So I can’t even have sex when I go home?”

“Not if you want to recover.”

I sign the contract. Like a good cheater.

“Thank you,” she says dryly, waving me out of the room.

Check-in: the feeling your balls get when you jump in a really cold
lake.

SAN FRANCISCO, ONE MONTH EARLIER

I’m standing at the baggage claim in San Francisco when the call comes.
I’ve just pulled my roller bag off the carousel.

“I got an email from Juliet,” Ingrid says.

The blood drains out of my face and my bones feel hollow. Something in
me has just been cut loose. It is fear. It is panic. It is sadness. It
is guilt. It is pain. It is every bad emotion at once. I’m as light as
cotton, yet I don’t have the strength to move.

“Is there anything you need to tell me?” she asks. I can hear the hurt
in her voice, the shock, the disbelief. Her world has just come apart at
the seams. What she thought was golden thread has turned out to be
polyester. She needs me to say it’s not true. And, more than anything, I
want to give her one more soothing lie to keep the fabric of our reality
stitched together.

I open my mouth to speak and nothing comes out. I can’t compound the
injury with one more deception. But I can’t bring myself to admit the
truth either. I have only one other option.

“Can I call you back?” If truth is not on my side, at least time can be.
“My plane was delayed and I’m late to my talk.”

I’m speaking at a big tech company about my books. And right now, it
seems so fucking unimportant, all this writing, all this time spent
hunched over a glowing screen, all this convincing myself that any of it
matters. People are what matter, not things.

And I have destroyed the person who matters most to me.

Just the night before, Ingrid texted me a photograph. She was on stage
in a bar, holding an immense trophy aloft, a huge silly grin on her face
as a crowd applauded her. Somehow, she’d won an annual
rock-paper-scissors championship against a hundred other people, even
though she’d barely played the game before. Looking at that image, I
felt as excited as if she’d won an Oscar. That’s my girlfriend. She’s a
champion. She can figure anything out and crush it.

Well, now she’s figured me out.

As I’m driving to the lecture, my heart pounding and mind racing, Ingrid
forwards the message she received from Juliet. I glance at it, see “we
had sex in his car, in my bed, and in my shower,” and can’t read
anymore. All I can imagine is how Ingrid must have felt when she read
those words.

This pause, this procrastination of the inevitable, is like the fuse on
a bomb. I see it burning and I’m scrambling to find a way to extinguish
it before it reaches the detonator. But there’s too much evidence Juliet
can provide: dates, times, texts, techniques. I don’t know what made me
believe I could get away with it or why I even put myself and Ingrid in
this position. The first time I did it out of desire. The second time I
did it out of guilt. The third time I did it out of fear: She’d
threatened to tell Ingrid. Then I didn’t do it the fourth time.

And that’s when the gates of hell opened.

At a generic office building, a generic man in a generic shirt leads me
to a generic room filled with more than a hundred generic employees. I
take a deep breath and spend the next hour telling them to enjoy their
lives and be their best selves, while in my chest I feel my life caving
in.

When I get to my hotel room, I plug my dying cell phone into the wall.
The cord is short, so I have to lie on the floor beneath the desk.

“I just got off the phone with Juliet,” Ingrid says when she answers.
“She told me about your birthmark.” My birthmark is a splotch of raised
red bumps, kind of like the six on a die, on the left side of my ass.
When I was ten, I read the book _The Omen_ and became convinced that my
birthmark was the mark of the Antichrist. Ingrid had a more positive
interpretation: She once took a thin black marker and connected the
bumps like islands on a pirate treasure map, with an X at the end.

“I also talked to Luke,” she says. Luke is a friend of ours. Juliet is
his ex-girlfriend. “He’s really upset.”

“I know, I know, I can explain,” I weakly protest.

“Neil, I am so hurt and in shock. I’m leaving. And I don’t want to see
you again. I don’t want to talk to you again. That’s it.”

Then she hangs up and I collapse crying on the floor. Just sobbing out
loud. Tears drip out of my eyes and my stomach heaves. I fucking blew
it. I blew it. I blew it.

And then the texts come: Luke says he’s going to punch me in the face
when I get home. Ingrid’s girlfriends want me dead. And I’m worried that
her stepbrothers are going to beat the shit out of me.

Not that I don’t deserve to be disfigured. At least my outside can match
how I feel inside. It’s not just the pain of losing Ingrid, it’s the
pain of knowing I’ve hurt her. In this life, we don’t meet many people
who truly love us, who accept us for who we are, who put us before
themselves. Maybe a parent or two if we’re lucky, perhaps a couple of
previous partners. So what kind of person rewards someone’s love with
lies, betrayal, and pain?

A selfish person. A coldhearted person. A thoughtless person. An
asshole. A liar. A cheater. A guy who thinks with his dick. Me.

As soon as I regain a semblance of control over my motor functions, the
next call I make is to Rick to ask for the name of the program he
recommended.

9

As I walk through a drab yellow hallway to the cafeteria, I feel a pain
in my groin, a psychologically induced ache. I’ve signed my soul to Joan
and turned my dick into an appendage, doomed to dangle desolately
between my legs and just piss occasionally.

“Let me ask you,” I nudge Charles, joining him in the food line. “Do you
think it’s male nature that makes us want to sleep with other people or
is it really an addiction?”

“It’s definitely an addiction,” Charles says authoritatively. “And the
day I finally admitted I was powerless over it was the happiest day of
my life. Suddenly I was no longer responsible. If I saw a beautiful
woman on the street and was attracted, I knew it wasn’t my fault. I just
looked away and said, ‘This is a disease and I’m powerless over it.’”

At a table near the caffeine-free-coffee maker, I spot a fashionably
dressed brunette with a red tag. She’s the first female sex addict I’ve
seen. So of course I sit next to her. She’s tall and graceful, like a
Siamese cat but with a forehead as big and shiny as a car mirror. Her
name, according to her tag, is Naomi.

She’s sitting next to a heavyset woman with short black hair, a lumpy
sweatsuit, and several chins and growths on her face. Charles refuses to
sit with us.

“We signed a contract,” Charles admonishes me.

“We’re not hitting on them. We’re just eating with them.”

“We’re not supposed to talk to female patients.”

“Says who? It’s not even in the contract.”

“You’re threatening my sobriety,” he warns.

Naomi laughs as Charles walks off, indignant. It’s the first music I’ve
heard since checking in. The laughter of a woman is a high unto itself.

As we eat, I ask Naomi about her story. She says she cheated on her
husband seventeen times. “I remember the first time I slept with someone
else. I got my first client on my own at work and my boss took me out to
congratulate me. We started drinking, and he leaned over and made out
with me. That acceptance was like a high for me. My head was just
spinning. I’ve cheated since then looking for that high again, and it’s
always the same situation: wanting acceptance from powerful men.”

As she speaks, I think about how easy it would be to fuck her. She’s got
a nice body, and she seems to have a wild side.

Shit, now I definitely broke the contract. Maybe Charles was right. A
shiver of remorse runs through me: Why am I trying to patch things up
with Ingrid when I’m still clearly not capable of the commitment she
expects? But I suppose that’s why I’m here: to become capable.

Check-in: shame.

Guilt is about breaking the rules. Shame is about being broken.

“My therapist gave me a really big insight today,” the person I just
accidentally fantasized about is saying. “I always put a lot of thought
and care into the clothes I wear. But she told me that dressing to get
attention is a form of acting out and part of my disease.”

These therapists must be stopped. If they succeed in bullying women out
of dressing beautifully, we might as well all move to Iran.

“She explained that sex addiction is different for women,” Naomi
continues. “Female sex addiction is usually about seeking love.”

She tells me that roughly 90 percent of sex addicts entering treatment
are men because guys tend to act out, while roughly 90 percent of people
with eating disorders are women because they tend to act in.

The woman next to her, Liz, has a purple tag, which she says is for
post-traumatic stress disorder. Because Naomi is the only female sex
addict here, they’re in the same group. “They diagnosed me as a sexual
anorexic,” Liz says.

I’ve never heard the term before, so Liz explains that it means she
avoids sex. She tells us she was raised in a cult and repeatedly
gang-raped. Eventually she ran away. And since then, she’s compulsively
eaten a lot, neglected to care for herself, and dressed sloppily to keep
men away. All those chins may look soft on the outside, but in actuality
they serve as a strong shield, keeping her body safe.

After lunch, as I walk along the path to the dorms, the sex-addicted sex
addiction therapist from Joan’s group spots me and motions me over with
his finger.

“Your last name is Strauss, right?” he asks when I join him on the lawn.
His name tag reads TROY.

“Um, yes.”

“I read your book.”

“Do me a favor and don’t tell anyone who I am,” I plead. “It’s too
ironic.”

“So why _are_ you here, man? I thought you’d be out living the life.”

“I was. I learned all that stuff and it was fun. But at some point I
want to get married and have a family, so I have to shut it off if I
want to do that.”

“I’ll tell you something,” Troy whispers conspiratorially. “As a sex
therapist, I’ve heard every story there is out there.” He gestures away
with his right arm. It doesn’t matter which direction he’s pointing: All
roads lead out of here and to the real world. “And after fifteen years
in this job, I don’t know if I believe in monogamy.”

I clap him on the back and breathe a sigh of relief. “Let’s talk some
more about that,” I tell him.

I’ve found either an ally in truth here or a partner in crime.

10

I’ve been sitting in this room with Joan for three straight days now and
I’ve barely spoken a word or learned a thing. Today, Calvin is in
trouble again. In the meantime, a new patient has joined us: a gay
crystal meth addict from Las Vegas named Paul. He sits in his chair,
unshaven, scratching his short brown hair, probably wondering why he’s
here as Calvin tells Joan, “I was doing equine therapy and there was
this girl”—Joan glares at him and he corrects himself—“I mean, woman,
there. Carrie.”

“Oh man, that’s my arousal template right there,” Troy mutters, patting
his chest.

Joan’s neck suddenly reddens. “Are you aware that undressing someone
with your eyes is covert sexualized violence?” She doesn’t yell—that
would signify a loss of control. Her weapon is severity. She knows just
how to reduce a man to a boy: become his mother on her worst day.

“Sorry, I am aware of that,” Troy says obediently.

I, however, am not aware of that. I want to ask her: Since when did
thinking become an act of violence? If you see a bank teller counting a
huge stack of bills and imagine taking it when she’s not looking, is
that covert bank robbery? And what are the charges?

“Go ahead, Calvin,” she says icily, “tell everyone how you pornified
Carrie.”

“I don’t know. I just noticed that she had riding boots on and was
talking about how she liked horses, and I do too. So I was fantasizing
about riding away on a horse with her and getting married.”

I always thought that sex addicts would be lecherous criminals, not
overgrown boys who fantasize about getting married to women who share
their interests. The first time I heard of sex addiction was when I saw
a news exposé as a teenager. It followed a sex addict who drove around
the city in a van with a mattress in back and somehow talked women into
hooking up with him in there. He was very ordinary looking and plainly
dressed, and I was envious that his sheer determination to have sex
could actually produce results when my desire was getting me nowhere
with the ladies.

I guess the moral is: Be careful what you wish for.

When I tune back into the room, Charles and Troy are bickering about
pronouns. Joan asks them to sit in chairs opposite each other and talk
using what she calls the communication boundary. She holds up a poster
board reading:

                 When I saw/heard ____________.

                 The story I told myself about that was ____________.

                 And I feel ____________.

                 So I would like to request that ____________.

Charles tries it: “When I heard you say that ‘we’re not monogamous by
design,’ the story I told myself about that was that it’s not true for
me. I’m here to get better. And I feel angry. So I would like to request
that in the future, you use _I_ to refer to yourself instead of _we_.”

“Well done,” Joan says. Then she turns to Troy, her voice saccharine
sweet: “Now you need to respond using the communication boundary.”

I look around and see Calvin drifting off again, no doubt fantasizing
about Carrie. I see Adam sitting next to him, probably wondering how to
convince his wife he’s been cured. And I see Santa Claus retreating
further into his mental hell, desperate for attention and advice. No
one’s problems are being dealt with. They’re going to leave rehab the
same as they walked in, just with more guilt and an awkward way of
communicating. I can’t take it anymore.

My voice cracks as I open my mouth to speak for the first time, and the
question spills out clumsily: “How is this helpful to us?”

“The way that we’re communicating in here is how people should be
communicating with their spouses,” Joan responds coolly.

“And that’s going to stop them from sleeping with other women?”

It’s a serious question, but everyone laughs. Joan’s face trembles for a
moment, as if nervous she’s about to lose control of the room. But then
she regains her composure and answers, “You learn to love yourselves by
learning to be relational with each other.” She emphasizes the word
_relational_ as if it’s a magical healing salve.

I don’t completely understand her answer, but it sounds like an
important concept. “I’m not sure I understand what you mean by
‘relational.’”

“Being relational is being in the moment—in the here and now—with
someone else. Here’s a tool you can use: Your mind can only do two
things at once. So if you can sit and feel your breath go in and out as
you listen to someone else, you are in the moment, in action. And when
you’re not in action, you’re not relational: You’re in reaction.”

Finally, she appears to be teaching us something relevant. “So you’re
saying that if we’re relational with people, then we won’t want to
cheat?”

She sizes me up for a second, trying to ascertain whether I’m a threat
or not. It’s the first time she’s actually looked me in the eye. “What
I’m saying is that if you have true intimacy with your partner, you
won’t need to seek sex outside the relationship.”

She holds me in her gaze for a moment longer, then slowly scans the
room. “This is the reason all of you ended up here. If you’re addicted
to sex, you’re probably co-addicted to something else, like drugs or
work or exercise, and this is because you’re afraid of intimacy and
you’re afraid of your feelings.”

I’m trying to get something out of this. I really am. But the
accusations and diagnoses fly around so quickly that it’s hard to accept
them just on faith. You come in as an alcoholic or a sex addict, and you
leave as an alcoholic codependent sex addict love avoidant with PTSD,
OCD, and ADD. We’re all suffering from low self-esteem, so I don’t see
how making us into walking DSMs helps.

Joan writes the words S.A.F.E. SEX on the blackboard. The acronym was
devised by Patrick Carnes, she explains, and it means that sex must
never be “_secretive, abusive,_ a way to alter _feelings,_ or _empty_ of
a committed intimate relationship.”

Before I can ask what’s wrong with casual, consensual sex, Joan
announces that a counselor named Lorraine is going to speak to us after
lunch about something called _eroticized rage_. Then she curtly
dismisses us to eat.

“I kept this to myself, but there was more to my fantasy,” Calvin
whispers as we rise to leave.

“What’s that?” I ask.

“I’m glad I didn’t tell her about the picnic.”

In the hallway, Adam and Troy are waiting for me. “Hey, man, I like the
way you stood up to Joan,” Troy says under his breath. “We all have
those questions, and it’s cool that you’re asking them.”

“Thanks.” From the corner of my eye, I notice Charles speaking with Joan
in the therapy room. I’m pretty sure he’s telling on me. Some folks live
to say, “I told you so.”

“Don’t give in to her,” Troy encourages me as we head to the cafeteria.
“She’s going to try to break you so you can be like Charles. But you
have to stand up for us.”

“Why don’t you guys just speak up for yourselves?”

“You know, we just want to make it through to the end of the program.”
He and Adam exchange glances. Troy is here because his wife caught him
having an affair with an import model he met on a website for women
seeking sugar daddies. “Joan, she doesn’t forget. And when our wives
come for family week, we don’t need her making things any more difficult
for us, if you know what I mean.”

I’ve heard other guys here mention family week like it’s the equivalent
of an IRS audit, so I ask them about it. They explain that the program
is divided by weeks here. In week one, you do your timeline; in week
two, you go through a psychological head trip known as chair work; in
week three, parents and wives visit so your therapist can help heal your
family system; and in the final week, you design a recovery plan for
when you leave.

For sex addicts, the family-week process includes something called
_disclosure_, which requires coming clean with a partner about past
affairs and transgressions. Ideally, once these final wounds heal, the
couple can build a new relationship from a place of truth and intimacy.
With a therapist who’s not tactful, though, or one who has a hidden
agenda, disclosure can quickly turn into disaster—and the next time the
addict sees his wife will be in court.

LOS ANGELES, TWO WEEKS EARLIER

I haven’t been able to cry since this happened. I keep trying. My
friends have cried for me, but I can’t. I gave him my heart and my soul
and . . . everything.

_This is the first time I’ve seen Ingrid since she said she never wanted
to see me again. It took countless emails, flowers, and coaxing from
mutual friends to bring her to couples therapy. And now that she’s here,
I can see what I’ve done. She’s pale and emaciated. Her eyes stare ahead
vacantly and her skin seems devoid of nerve endings, like a combat
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder._

Do you think you can trust him again?

I don’t trust him. I just don’t. I feel hopeless.

_And it rips me apart to know that I was the traumatic stress._

Did you trust him before all this happened?

Yes, of course. I had 150 percent trust in him before. I thought our
relationship was the best thing that ever happened to me. It was like I
was on ecstasy every day. I was walking on a cloud.

And how did you feel, Neil?

I felt the same way.

_Ingrid shakes her head slowly and a distant voice inside her replies._

That’s not possible. There must have been something wrong for you to do
that.

There wasn’t, I swear. It had nothing to do with you. I just got . . .
weak.

Ingrid, what would you need to even consider being in this relationship
again?

I just need three things.

What are those?

Honesty, trust, and loyalty.

_The therapist turns to me. I know what she’s going to ask. The only
question I don’t want to answer._

Do you think you’re able to give her those things?

_This is it: I must make a choice. The truth or the lie. Just one word
either way. If I choose the truth, I risk losing her forever. If I
choose the lie, I get to stay with her, but I continue living in deceit
and risk hurting her again._

_I start to speak. It’s hard to get the words out. It’s hard because
I’ve opted for the truth._

I can’t say for sure that I’m strong enough yet to resist every
temptation out there. This is why I’m going to rehab. So I can work on
myself and make sure this never happens again. I need to understand how
I could have done this to someone I love so much.

_Suddenly, Ingrid throws her arms around me and we embrace tightly, with
as much pain as passion. Tears spring from both our eyes and make trails
on the other’s cheeks._

_The first tears are sadness. The second are relief. And the third are
the most dangerous of all: They are hope._

Lorraine is a bird-like woman in her fifties with long shaggy gray hair,
taut lips, a big beak, and incongruous thigh-high black boots. The
wounds of whatever struggle she went through still show in the lines on
her face.

“I’m here to tell you that sex addiction goes away,” she announces to
us. “The compulsion stops. It’s not like alcohol. You can get past this.
Recovery, if you work at it, will take you three to five years.”

At first, the words sound reassuring. But then I realize that if you
work hard enough on almost any behavior, it can be changed in three to
five years. I suppose another term for recovery is just behavior
modification. There could be twelve-step programs for biting your nails,
picking your nose, saying “I’m sorry” when you’re not really sorry, and,
perhaps more dangerous than cheating on a spouse, texting while driving.

Lorraine tells us, as she’s probably told every addict who’s passed
through here for the last decade, that her alcoholic father would lock
her in a closet for hours at a time when she was three; that she was
molested by a priest at age twelve; and that she spent most of her adult
life as a codependent, stuck in a marriage to an abusive, alcoholic
husband. She was one of those women who couldn’t leave the man who beat
her—until he drank himself to death.

When Lorraine was here twenty years ago, her tag was blue.

“What I just presented to you was my timeline,” she explains. “And all
of you are going to do your own timelines this week. Who here has
childhood trauma?”

Everyone raises his hand except for me, Adam, and Santa Claus, who
probably didn’t hear the question.

Lorraine stares at us incredulously. “Trauma comes from _any_ abuse,
neglect, or abandonment. Think of it this way: Every time a child has a
need and it’s not adequately met, that causes what we define as trauma.”

“But by that definition, is there anyone in the world who doesn’t have
trauma?” I ask her.

“Probably not,” she replies quickly. “We link and store any experience
that brings us fear or pain because we need to retain that information
to survive. All you have to do is touch a hot stove once and your
behavior around hot stoves changes for the rest of your life—whether you
remember getting burned or not. So think of anything in your childhood
that was less than nurturing as a hot stove, and when you encounter
something similar as an adult, it can trigger your learned survival
response. We have a saying here: _If it’s hysterical, it’s historical_.”

I look around the room. Everyone seems to be drinking this in. I suppose
we’re all broken in some way, whether or not we choose to admit it to
others—or to ourselves.

“Most people think of trauma as the result of a serious assault,
disaster, or tragedy,” Lorraine continues. “But a small trauma, like a
parent criticizing you day in and day out, can be just as damaging
because it’s happening on a regular basis. Think of it this way: If one
big-T Trauma is a ten on the scale and a little-t trauma is a one, then
ten little traumas can be just as powerful as one big Trauma.”

Lorraine is blunt and severe, perhaps even more so than Joan, but
there’s something about the way she speaks that I trust. She doesn’t
seem to have a chip on her shoulder, nor does she sound like a member of
the Moral Majority. And at least I’m finally learning something, though
I’m not yet sure how it will help me be faithful to Ingrid.

“When children experience trauma, they tend to absorb the feelings of
their abusers and store them in a compartment in their psyche that we
call the shame core. It contains the beliefs _I am worthless, I am
unlovable, I don’t deserve_. Any time you feel _one down_—or inferior—to
someone or you feel _one up_—or superior—those are false beliefs
generated by your shame core. Because, in reality, every person in the
world has equal worth and value.”

Charles interrupts, “But I’m thinking of you as better than me because
you’re an expert on this topic and you know so much more than me. So
what should I do?”

“And how do you feel about that?” Lorraine asks. “I’m standing here, a
middle-aged widow, telling you how to live your life. I’m telling you I
know more than you do and I’m one up to you.”

“I feel anger,” Charles says.

“Exactly. To survive painful beliefs and feelings, we often mask them
with anger. That way, we don’t have to feel the shame behind it.”

I look at Joan. She’s watching Lorraine with a frown, rapping her pencil
against her knuckles. “The payoff of anger is mastery, control, or
power,” Lorraine continues. “So the anger makes you feel better and one
up. And when you use sex to restore power or feel better about yourself
in a similar way, this is what’s known as eroticized rage.”

Eighty-eight percent of sex addicts, she tells us, came from emotionally
disengaged families. Seventy-seven percent came from rigid or strict
families. And sixty-eight percent say their families were both distant
and strict.

“Being overcontrolled as a child sets you up to lie as an adult,” she
concludes. “So the theory of sex addiction is that when you feel out of
control or disempowered, you sneak around and act out sexually to
reestablish control and regain your sense of self.”

This is where she loses me. “Can you give a specific example?” I ask.

“Well,” she replies with what appears to be a touch of condescension,
“what’s your story?” Or perhaps it’s not condescension, it’s caring, and
my shame core is just flaring up.

“I cheated on my girlfriend.”

“Strict mother?”

“Yes.”

“Mom wasn’t emotionally available, so you’re taking out your dick and
using it to look for love. And sex is healing the anger at Mom for not
being available.” She speaks quickly and confidently, as if my story is
exactly what she knew it would be.

“So I fuck other women to get back at my mom?”

“And to have an emotionally safe way of getting the affection,
acceptance, and comfort you never got from Mom.”

“I don’t know. It felt like my mom was always there for me.”

She strokes her hair, which is as prodigious and thick as Rick Rubin’s
beard, and asks a question that will alter my entire understanding of my
childhood: “Was she there for you . . . or were you there for her?”

Chicago, Thirty Years Earlier

_Y_ou know the drill, right?

Yes, Mom.

Then let’s go over it again.

_My younger brother and I are at the kitchen table, eating cereal. My
mom sits in a chair backed against the wall, her mismatched legs
dangling from her housedress at different heights off the ground. She
observes us carefully as we speak, trying to ascertain whether we can be
trusted._

If you die, we’re not allowed to tell anyone.

What do you do if Uncle Jerry calls?

Don’t say anything until afterward.

Right.

Then we go get you cremated.

What if Daddy tells you I should be buried? He wants that, you know. He
doesn’t care.

We don’t listen to him. We make sure you get cremated. Then we put the
ashes in a Marshall Field’s box.

And then what?

We take the box to Lincoln Park and scatter the ashes.

Right. And no funeral. No obituary. No grave. Nothing. Don’t tell anyone
I’ve died until after it’s done, in case they try to stop you.

Can we keep the box?

Yes, you may keep the box.

And then we’re going to meet you at the bookstore, right?

We’ll meet at Kroch’s & Brentano’s in Water Tower. In the magazine
aisle.

Should we meet at the guys’ magazines or the girls’ magazines?

Either one is fine.

I’ll be looking at the music magazines, okay? I’ll wait for you all day.
In case you’re late.

You may not know I’m there, but I’ll be there. I’ll try to find some way
to let you know.

_I imagine her as a ghost, in another plane where she can see me but I
can’t see her. And I hope that if I stay alert, I’ll be able to sense
her presence in a cool gust of air or a sudden rustling of magazine
pages or . . ._

Maybe you can whisper something in my ear.

I’ll try to do that. Now hurry up and wash the dishes. The school bus
will be here in ten minutes and you’re always late.

Yes, Mom.

Don’t ever forget what I told you today.

When Lorraine finishes her lecture, Joan’s lips curve into something
resembling a smile. She walks to the front of the room, then lets us
bask for a moment in the knowledge that we are now not just sex addicts
but rageaholics. We fuck women because we hate our mothers.

Although pleased with the net effect of the talk, Joan also seems
resentful of Lorraine’s easy command and sway over our minds. She
motions brusquely for Lorraine to leave, then turns to us and speaks.
“One of the other therapists tells me that the male sex addicts have
been talking to her female sex addict. I told her that it can’t have
been my guys, it must have been her patient. But then”—she raises her
eyebrows in feigned shock—“I was told by a member of this group exactly
what happened and who was responsible.”

I flash Charles a dirty look and turn back to feel Joan’s glare heating
my face. “Do you see women as human beings or do you see them as a
collection of body parts?” she asks.

It’s such a loaded, judgmental question that I don’t feel like answering
it. I stay silent to see if I can get away with pretending like it’s
rhetorical, but she just repeats the question. So I tell her, “I see
them as human beings. I’m not a serial killer.”

“I would beg to differ,” she responds, as if she really believes that
eye-fucking someone should be punishable by lethal injection.

I want to be a better person. I want to have a healthy relationship. I
don’t want to cheat and lie and cause pain. But outside of Lorraine’s
talk, the lifesaving healing and lessons in intimacy that Rick said I’d
experience here are nowhere to be found. I’m trying to have an open
mind, but Joan keeps filling it with garbage.

“As a consequence of your behavior,” Joan continues, “I’m going to have
to take more extreme measures with all of you.”

She holds up several slips of paper, each with the words MALES ONLY on
it. “I’m requiring all of you to wear this in your badge, displayed
prominently at all times. From this moment forward, you are not allowed
to even say _hi_ to a woman.”

What if she says _hi_ first? I wonder. But Joan’s already closed the
loopholes, with the exception of one: Paul, the lone gay member of the
group, also has a badge that reads MALES ONLY. “Just point to your badge
if they say anything.” She slams her pencil onto her desk. “If any of
you are seen talking to a woman, I _will_ hear about it.”

Now we don’t just have the scarlet letter, we’ve been muzzled. It’s hard
to tell if they’re healing our shame core here or adding to it.

“What about you?” Charles asks. “You’re a woman. Are we allowed to talk
to you?”

And that’s the last straw for me. I’m not like Charles. I can’t just
blindly obey. It needs to make fucking sense to me. It’s like going to a
church to be a better person, but then being told that the only way to
do it is by worshipping a god you don’t believe in. Maybe I’ve come to
the wrong place to learn how to be intimate and decide if a sexually
exclusive relationship is right for me. So far, this program is as
effective at teaching monogamy as prisons are at teaching morality.

“Is the underlying principle of all this the idea that if we have true
intimacy in our relationship, we won’t seek outside sex?” I ask Joan.

“Yes,” she says, with some satisfaction that I appear to be getting it.

I ask again, just to make sure. I want everyone in the room to hear
exactly what she’s saying. Troy’s advice from earlier echoes through my
head: I’m not going to let her break me. I’m going to be the voice of
sanity. Of reality.

“If you had true intimacy in your relationships,” she repeats, “you
wouldn’t be seeking sex outside your relationships.”

“I have this thing that’s been going through my head all day. Is it all
right if I ask it?”

“Please.” The word drips with disdain.

“Is it okay to use the blackboard?” I don’t know any other way to
explain it.

Her back stiffens. She senses something unpredictable may be about to
happen. She shoots me a stern look, trying to melt my resolve as I
approach the blackboard.

My hand starts shaking as I pick up a piece of chalk. I write her words
on the board:

_If true intimacy, then no outside sex._

“That’s your theory,” I begin. “If you boil it down to the basic idea
behind it, what you get is this . . .”

_If true X, then no outside Y._

“And the problem is, this equation just isn’t true.” In school, I never
thought I’d actually have to use algebra in real life. I was wrong.
“Even if you make both X and Y the exact same variable, it still doesn’t
work.”

I continue writing:

_If true X in the relationship, then no X outside the relationship._

“Let’s say, for example, that your wife is the best cook in the world.
Then according to what you’re saying, you’ll never want to eat anywhere
else.”

Joan remains quiet, watching me, letting me write on her blackboard,
rattling me with her lack of reaction.

_If true cooking in the relationship, then no cooking outside the
relationship._

“But that’s just not true. Sometimes you want to go to a restaurant for
a change.”

The guys are watching intently. Calvin is on the edge of his seat. Troy
has a big smile on his face. Charles’s brows are deeply furrowed.

This is it. This is the moment where I disprove all the bullshit Joan’s
been feeding us. She can have her revenge afterward, whatever it may be.

“Now let’s go back to your original premise. And let’s make it even
stronger.”

_If true intimacy, then no outside intimacy._

“Even that statement isn’t true. You seek intimacy with your parents,
your siblings, and your friends. No matter how you look at it, what
you’re telling us doesn’t add up.”

She says nothing. I press on.

“The other issue is that you’re telling us intimacy and sex are related
like this . . .

[image]

“But for men—and not just the guys here but every man I know—they’re
like this . . .

[image]

“So what are we supposed to do with all the rest of our sexual needs?”

The guys are staring openmouthed now, big dopey grins on their
faces—except for Charles, who’s looking at Joan imploringly. I must be
interfering with his recovery again.

“Here’s what I’m starting to think,” I press on. “People are under the
logical fallacy that when their partner wants sex outside the
relationship, it’s harmful to their intimacy together. We are all here
because we don’t believe that’s true, but we do believe that lying and
deceit harm intimacy. So instead of being retrained to accept a
relationship on our partners’ terms, we could just as easily retrain
them to accept the relationship on our terms.”

Troy dares to applaud. Calvin pumps his fist into the air in solidarity.

Joan doesn’t change her expression. She’s stone cold. “Cross out _if
intimacy, then no outside intimacy_,” she instructs me. I do as she
says. “Now cross out, _if cooking, then no outside cooking_.” I do that.
“Now go back to your seat.” I do that too.

She stares at the board. “I’m processing,” she says.

The room is completely silent. It’s like a chess match. And everyone’s
wondering if it’s checkmate.

Finally, Joan turns to me. “You need to define _intimacy_.”

“Would you like me to do that now?”

“You can do that on your own time.”

I’m disappointed, because I know the answer. I heard it recently in the
patient lounge, where someone was quoting Pia Mellody, who’s the Patrick
Carnes of codependency: _Intimacy is sharing your reality with someone
else and knowing you’re safe, and them being able to share their reality
with you and also be safe._

“The definition doesn’t have any bearing on what I’ve said, anyway,” I
tell her.

“I think you’re intellectualizing to be able to control the overall
addiction,” she responds.

That’s all she’s got: to tell me to stop using my brain? “That’s what
dictators like Pol Pot and Hitler and Stalin say. They burn books and
kill intellectuals so no one can question them.”

The response comes out more confrontational than it’s meant to be. I’m
not trying to rebel. All my relationships have been disasters and
something clearly needs to change. “So help me,” I add, beseechingly. “I
_want_ to be wrong. I _want_ to recover. But I need to reconcile this
contradiction. What you’re teaching us needs to actually make sense to
me.”

“This is your addict fighting against recovery and not letting go,” she
says sharply. She looks at the clock and rises to her feet. “You’re all
late for dinner.”

She walks to the desk and starts gathering papers, holding her head high
as if she’s prevailed. Yet everyone, possibly even Charles, is aware
that not only did she fail to defend her thesis, but quite possibly she
couldn’t.

“Neil,” her voice rings out as I’m leaving, loud enough for everyone to
hear, “why don’t you present your timeline to the group tomorrow?”

15

At dinner we all sit together, the red demons of the round table. We are
bonded now in brotherhood, in celibacy, in shame, in sickness, in
punishment, in victory, and by the fact that we’re all wearing signs
that read MALES ONLY around our necks.

Nearby I see the anorexics in their workout clothes; Carrie, the love
addict; Dawn, the alcoholic; and Naomi, the female sex addict. And they
are ghostlike to me, creatures in an alternate dimension I can’t
communicate with.

The mood at our all-male table is jubilant and conspiratorial. If the
guys could carry me on their shoulders, they would. I am their white
knight, their sacrificial lamb, their dick in shining latex. In the
meantime, from my perspective, something has shifted. This whole notion
of sex addiction is unraveling for me. And quite possibly for everyone
else. I came here with such high expectations from Rick, but all rehab
has done so far is make me even more ambivalent about relationships and
monogamy.

“You know, I’ve been thinking about how Joan made me add up all the
money I spent,” Calvin says. In the outside world, he’s a day trader who
writes about conspiracy theories online. “And most of it was worth it. I
was with a porn star from Serbia once. She was a ten. Cost a thousand
dollars—and she worked me over. It was the best experience of my life. I
wouldn’t trade it for anything.” He pauses and reflects. “I’ve probably
wasted more money on bad food.”

“And bad dates,” adds Troy, the sex therapist. He tears open three bags
of sugar substitute and pours them into his coffee substitute.

“Okay, here’s my main question about this place,” I begin. “I think
helping us understand our childhoods and heal our wounds—that will help
our relationships. But I don’t know if I buy the idea that wanting to
sleep with other people is an unhealthy response to that trauma. I mean,
they told me when I checked in that if I masturbated, I was a sex
addict.”

“Let me tell you, Neil, just be glad you’re not in one of the sex
addiction programs run by the church,” Adam says. “My wife made me go to
one of those before I came here. They consider you a sex addict if you
have premarital sex.”

Troy flashes a big grin. “We’re guys. We like sex. Everywhere you turn,
you’re shown pictures of gorgeous women who look like they want to cater
to your every desire. And then what? If you think about sleeping with
them, suddenly you’re sick and unhealthy?”

Adam nods. “You know, I don’t think there are many guys who, if they
were staying alone in a hotel and a beautiful woman wanted to have sex
with them, would turn it down.”

Suddenly Charles slaps the table, as if trying to snap us out of a
trance. “This is your disease talking right now, guys. You can’t trust
your thoughts. Your addiction will say anything so it can keep
controlling you.”

“How old’s your wife, Charles?” Troy asks.

“She’s forty-eight.”

“And do you find her attractive?”

“I don’t know. She’s a beautiful person.”

“So when’s the last time you had sex with her?”

“Eight years ago. But I brought that on myself.”

“Adam, what about you?” Troy asks.

“Things were okay at first,” Adam says. “But when we had kids,
everything changed. She just let herself go. We tried having date nights
once a month, but all she’d do is worry about the kids. So we stopped
doing that too. And”—he hesitates—“I’ll tell you honestly: I like sex
that’s exciting, you know, and sometimes a little rough. And she just
lies there like once every three months, and basically lets me have sex
with her.”

And I wonder: Is this the reality I’m here training for? To cut off my
dick in a sexless marriage, and then pathologize myself as a sex addict
if I break down one night and sleep with a woman at the office or an
ex-girlfriend while I’m traveling or even a hooker, just so I can
remember what it feels like to have my dick sucked?

“So what do they expect?” Exasperation pushes the words out of me with
unexpected force. “It’s just common sense. If your partner hasn’t had
sex with you for a year, you should be allowed to get it elsewhere
without having to throw away your entire relationship.”

“Sex isn’t something you’re entitled to just because you want it,”
Charles admonishes me. “Pretending like this is common sense and natural
is a form of denial. If you want any hope of overcoming this, you have
to recognize and intervene on your distorted thinking. When I see
another woman, for example, I just tell myself, Bright red apple, wrong
orchard.”

As the guys laugh over Charles’s orchard, I’m overwhelmed by a crushing
anxiety. A vision forms in my head before I can stop it. I grab my
notebook and sketch it for the guys. They gather around to look:

THE MALE DILEMMA

1. Sex is great.

2. Relationships are great.

3. Relationships grow over time.

4. The sex gets old over time.

5. So does she.

6. Thus the problem.

It’s a horrible thing to write or even think. No one could ever say this
in regular society. They’d be destroyed for it. But it seems to be the
reason most of these middle-aged guys are here. “That just about sums it
up,” Adam says sadly.

Troy shakes his head resolutely. “You wanna hear something tragic? I was
still having sex with my wife four times a week when I started my
affair.”

“And that’s the problem with what Joan’s been telling us.” Calvin
flashes a big, guilty grin. “Sex isn’t always about intimacy. Sometimes
you just want some dirty sex.”

Charles jumps out of his seat and announces, “This is not good for my
recovery.” He grabs his tray and walks away, looking for another table
without women.

The counselor supervising the anorexics turns around and scowls at us,
so we take it down to a whisper. We’re rehab insurgents plotting a
revolution. “Wanting variety is natural,” Troy says quietly as the guys
lean in. “Look at porn: Guys don’t watch the same girl every time.”

I think about one of the books the attendant confiscated when I checked
in: James Joyce’s _Ulysses_. The main character is an advertising
salesman with a gorgeous wife at home. And he wanders around Dublin,
worried that she’s cheating while he gawks at and fantasizes about women
of all ages, shapes, and sizes. At one point he starts wondering what
his problem is, until he concludes very simply, “The new I want.”

Santa Claus looks up from his food and speaks for the first time today,
acknowledging morosely, “That’s why I kept going to Tijuana. You could
walk around a club with sixty women and have any one of them. And the
things they could do . . .” Then he drops his head again.

“You know who the best girlfriend would be?” Calvin interjects, his eyes
lit up as if he’s just had the perfect picnic. “That mutant from _X-Men_
who can turn into anyone she wants. I’d never get bored of her! You
could have sex with Megan Fox one night and Hillary Clinton the next.”

“Hillary Clinton?!” Troy asks for all of us.

“Why not? Just for the experience,” Calvin says. “Don’t tell me you’ve
never thought about it.”

None of us has.

I’m intoxicated by the discussion. But in the back of my mind, I wonder:
Are we a bunch of junkies in denial—addicts bonding over our favorite
drug—or is this just a natural by-product of high testosterone? In a
book on evolution I once read, the writer cited research claiming that
gay women have fewer than ten partners on average in their lifetimes
whereas gay men have more than a hundred. So I ask Paul about it.

“I’ve been with over a thousand guys,” he confirms. His voice is raspy
and gruff, and he has the permanent look of someone who’s had a rough
night partying. “But it’s different in our world, because everyone wants
to have casual sex. So, literally, guys would come over to my place and
instead of hooking up, they’d go online and invite more people. I’d have
a dozen guys fucking each other in my living room sometimes.”

“I once interviewed a woman who was going through a sex change to become
a man,” I tell him. “And she told me that as soon as the testosterone
therapy kicked in, she suddenly understood men, because she wanted to
fuck everything that moved.”

“Imagine if women were wired like men,” Calvin says dreamily.

“It would be sexual pandemonium,” Troy replies with a big smile.

I ask them the ultimate question: “So if your wife allowed you to sleep
with other women, would you allow her to sleep with other men?”

And much to my surprise, every guy except Adam says yes. “I wouldn’t
like it, but I guess I’d have to suck it up,” Troy says.

Adam appears uncomfortable. We may have gone too far for him. Unlike the
rest of us, he doesn’t yearn for casual sex or variety; he just wants
the love and passion his marriage is lacking. “Here’s the thing you’re
all missing,” he says, laying his huge hands on the table. “We’re not
here because we had sex. We’re here because we lied, because we wanted
sex so badly that we violated our own moral values.”

He has a great point. No one is actually here for promiscuity. They’re
here solely for cheating. Except for Calvin, of course, and for Paul,
who came to get off crystal meth but was placed in our group when he
mentioned sex parties in his intake interview. “You’re right,” I tell
Adam. “If we were single and behaved exactly the same, we wouldn’t be
here. It wouldn’t be considered an addiction. If the rule was that
you’re not allowed to eat sushi once you’re married, we’d all be here as
sushi addicts.”

“So maybe the answer to your male dilemma is that you sacrifice,” Adam
replies. “You tough it out and stand beside your wife, for better or
worse, as a choice that you’re led to by faith in your family and God.”

“But why should you have to make that sacrifice?” I ask. “A relationship
should be about what you both want, not about what you both don’t want
each other to have. There must be some way in which we can have freedom
and our partners can have security—or we can all have both freedom _and_
security.”

Troy points a long finger at me. “See, that’s the kind of thinking they
want to stop here.” He stretches an arm along the back of Charles’s
vacant chair. “The problem with therapy is that they try to normalize
everyone and keep them in the middle of the road. But if you do that to
a society, there’s no innovation. Nothing new is created. You need that
one caveman who said, ‘We can’t just keep waiting for lightning to
strike every time we need fire. We have to make fire ourselves.’ They
probably thought he was crazy, rubbing rocks and sticks together. Today
they’d diagnose him as obsessive-compulsive. But then he gave them fire,
and all of a sudden everyone was doing it. You can’t get anywhere as a
civilization without that kind of original thinking and focus. It’s
people with compulsive behaviors who change the world.”

As Calvin fist-bumps Troy, I wonder if maybe life has led me here not to
cure my supposed sex addiction, but to take on a mission for the
betterment of my peers and the world: to redesign relationships so that
the needs of both sexes can be met. Because they don’t seem to be
working as it is.

Chicago, Twenty-Eight Years Earlier

_Sigh._ You’re the only one I can talk to around here.

What about your friends?

I can’t trust them.

Not even Denise?

She’s the worst of all. Never tell her anything. She can’t keep her
mouth shut.

Okay.

_I’m lying in bed wearing_ Star Wars _pajamas, a comic book and
flashlight tucked under the covers. My mom’s sitting in a small desk
chair pulled up to the side of the bed. Sometimes, when she’s really
upset at my dad and has no one else to talk to, she comes to me. This is
one of those times._

I’ve just had it up to here with your father.

Is that why you guys were fighting?

Do you hear the way he swears at me—in front of you and your brother?
He’s a monster. I don’t think he has any feelings.

He must have feelings.

He doesn’t. He’s like a rock. I remember I returned from my honeymoon
and asked my mother if I could divorce him. And she said she wouldn’t
let me come back home if I did that. So I stayed with him, that selfish
bastard.

You don’t have to stay with him now, though. You’re an adult.

Where am I going to go? Who’s going to take care of me?

I’ll take care of you.

You’re not old enough. Where are you going to get the money?

I don’t know. Maybe you can find someone else with more money than Dad.
Then you can be happy.

Maybe when I was younger. I had a lot of confidence then. I even entered
a beauty contest. A lot of men wanted to date me, if you can imagine
that. But your dad has ruined me. You know he could only get it up
twice: once for you and once for your brother.

Really?

Really. Listen to me, Neil: Whatever you do, never grow up to make
anyone as miserable as your father makes me.

17

After dinner, I walk across the grounds to the art room to work on my
timeline. I’m supposed to present the story of my life from birth to age
eighteen, which Joan doubtless plans to use to pathologize me as a sex
addict and troublemaker. And if that’s the truth, so be it. I’ll give
her everything she needs.

I grab a long sheet of butcher paper and a black marker. Then I read a
handout with instructions. I’m supposed to write my family message along
the top of the butcher paper; words describing the different members of
my family down the sides; and, along the bottom, a list of my family
rules, my most prevalent feeling growing up, and the role I played in my
family system.

Then I’m supposed to draw a long horizontal line from one side of the
paper to the other, and to write positive memories above it and negative
memories below it in chronological order.

Carrie sits two chairs away from me working on her own timeline, her
nipples practically jutting through her shirt. “How’s it going, Neilio?”
she asks with a friendly smile.

I show her the slip of paper in my badge and trace a fake tear out of my
eye. She pretends to catch it and put it in her pocket. This feels a lot
like flirting.

I turn away instantly, exercising too little self-control too late. Next
to me, a large-jawed, broad-faced man in a white T-shirt and jeans is
working feverishly with a charcoal pencil. He looks like he could play
the romantic lead in a Hollywood film, except for his forehead and his
posture. The former is deeply furrowed, as if his brain is in pain; the
latter is rigid, almost bristling, as if the slightest touch will send
him into a fit of tears or violence or both.

I look at his drawing. It’s a very detailed rendering of a demonic,
childlike face behind bars. And it’s beautifully done—good enough to
sell to Goth kids. He notices me admiring it and I avert my eyes. Too
late.

“Have you heard the story about the kid who wanders into the forest and
gets captured by a witch?” he asks, his voice monotone.

“Hansel and Gretel?”

“No, this kid was bound with a golden cord. And when he got free and
told people, no one believed him.”

“I don’t think I know it, but . . .”

“That’s me,” he says laconically, pointing to the creepy child face.
“The bars are what separate me from everyone else. And no one can see
through them to the monster I’m hiding inside.”

His tag is purple for post-traumatic stress disorder. His name is Henry.
It’s clear someone did something horrible to Henry—probably
repeatedly—and no one believed him when he sought help.

Henry says he runs a furniture-manufacturing company. As we discuss our
lives, I’m aware that Carrie is nearby, listening to every word. And
although I’m speaking to Henry, I’m also talking for her benefit. I’m
following the rules but missing the point.

“Guys don’t shoot themselves in the heart,” Henry is telling me. “They
shoot themselves in the head because they’re trying to shut their brain
up.”

I try to focus on my timeline. I write a few words describing how I saw
my mother when I was a child, then a few words about my father.

                 MOTHER

                 Punishing

                 Strict

                 Secretive

                 Complaining

                 Suffering

                 FATHER

                 Distant

                 Unemotional

                 Selfish

                 Temperamental

                 Alone

As I review the list, I realize that my family fits neatly into the sex
addict mold that Lorraine taught us: Mother is strict and punishing
(i.e., rigid) and father is distant and unemotional (i.e., disengaged).

I press on, writing down my most prevalent feeling growing up
(“misunderstood”) and my family role (“the black sheep”). Next I’m
supposed to list my family rules.

And that’s when I get stuck. Not because I can’t think of any rules, but
because there were so many of them. Too many rules to think about right
now.

I feel a rush of anxiety and decide to postpone this part of the
assignment. In the meantime, I start filling in the timeline with
childhood memories that had a strong impact or imprint. Until I explored
my father’s closet, I never thought of my childhood as particularly bad
or unusual. Although my parents were strict and at times eccentric, they
loved me and provided for me. But as I start unpacking my memories, a
small black cloud drifts into the idyllic picture.

I remember that some days my mother told me never to be like my father;
but other times, when she was mad at me, she’d say I was just like my
dad. And this was a man she apparently hated. She complained about the
way he smelled, the way he slouched, the way he chewed his food, even
the way he put his hands in his pockets. She’d call him temperamental,
selfish, awkward, embarrassing, and a loser with no friends.

Suddenly, I notice that her constant admonishments that I’m just like my
father are not only the root of my self-esteem problems, but that every
word I used on the timeline to describe him was a word I’ve also used to
describe my negative qualities: distant, unemotional, selfish,
temperamental, alone.

For a moment everything in the room goes silent, and I feel an old wound
begin to tear open. I shake it off and try to focus my attention
elsewhere, like on Carrie.

“I’m running a meeting tonight for incest and rape survivors, if you
want to come,” a monotone voice tells my ear. It’s Henry. And suddenly
my tiny black cloud seems like a small white wisp compared to big-T
Trauma.

“Okay.” Anything to avoid having to think about this stuff.

As I put away my supplies and prepare to walk out with Henry, Carrie
writes something on a piece of paper and hands it to me.

I read it instantly: “When I’m in L.A., we have to hang out.”

I nod yes. And then I realize: If I can’t control myself around her,
then maybe I do have an addiction. This is my chance to demonstrate that
I’m not powerless. I resolve not to give Carrie my number, and to resist
doing anything else that will violate my celibacy contract for the rest
of the time I’m here.

I hurry out of the art room with Henry like Lot escaping Sodom. If I
look back, I’ll turn into a pillar of addict.

When we get to the meeting, two women are already there: Dawn, my other
temptation, and a sickly looking freckle-dusted brunette in her
thirties. Henry arranges us into a square of four chairs. He picks up a
binder with instructions and readings for twelve-step meetings, then
sets it aside. “Let’s not do this,” he says, speaking slowly, as if each
word requires effort to utter. “Let’s just talk. I can begin.”

He pauses for five long seconds, the corners of his mouth trembling,
then continues. “I snuck out to the street last night. I stood there and
looked at the cars passing by in the dark. And I thought about throwing
myself in front of one. I stayed there for an hour. I wanted so badly to
end it all. It wouldn’t take much effort. Just a little bit of courage
to take that leap.”

Not only did he almost get himself killed, I think, he almost got
himself sued for violating the Promise Not to Commit Suicide form he
signed.

“You don’t worry about losing your life when you don’t have one, when it
was taken from you,” he continues. He’s silent again for several
seconds, his brow furrowing and unfurrowing. “I remember the first time
my brother raped me. I was in my room, and he came in and held me down.
He choked me while he did it and said he was going to kill me if I made
a sound or ever told anyone.”

Henry goes on to talk about an evening, years later, when his father
caught him molesting a horse in the barn and beat him. “For a long time,
I’d seek out prostitutes, usually men, to whip me and beat me,” he
continues. “I got into some dangerous situations. My wife doesn’t know
any of this. Not even about my brother. When I told her I was going to
rehab for post-traumatic stress disorder, she just looked at me and
said, ‘That explains it.’ That really hurt me.”

Dawn volunteers to speak next. Her story is also horrifying. She tells
us about two memories of her father fondling her. A decade later, he was
arrested for sexually abusing other underage girls. She testified
against him and now he’s serving time in prison. Then the freckly woman
tells us how her adoptive father would come home drunk, stagger into her
room, and molest her.

“I called him last night and asked him to come for family week to help
me heal,” she says, her eyes and nose filling with tears and mucus. “And
he actually agreed to come.”

As a culture, we voraciously consume horror movies about vampires,
ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural beings. But people are much
scarier than any monster we can make up. It’s not just the acts of
horror they perpetrate on each other, but even when they spare the
person’s life, they still take their soul, their spirit, their
happiness. These offenders are the kinds of people I used to think of
when someone mentioned sex addicts, not guys like Adam and Calvin.

“I just want me back,” Henry is saying, his eyes ringed red. “I want to
know who I am.”

Then he looks at me and waits. I’m the only one who hasn’t spoken. And I
haven’t been an incest or rape victim. But then I remember: One day,
when I was in seventh grade, the school bully fondled me, then tried to
have anal sex with me. The next day, he and his friends began a
relentless bullying campaign against me. I lived in terror for the rest
of the school year.

“I’m not supposed to talk to women,” I tell the group. “But I guess this
is okay.” I then share the story, which I’ve never told a single person
before. It was my first sexual experience, I conclude, and perhaps my
obsession later in life with seduction was a way of overcompensating and
proving to myself that I was straight.

As the three of them respond supportively, I still feel like an
impostor: My trauma is woefully inadequate compared to theirs.

Even here, in a hospital of misfits, I don’t fit in.

Chicago, Twenty-Six Years Earlier

Take off your shoes.

I know, Mom.

And put them on the mat, not the carpet like last time.

Yes, Mom.

Now go wash your hands before touching anything. It’s too hard for me to
keep cleaning your dirty fingerprints off the walls.

Okay, jeez.

And don’t forget: Dinner is at six o’clock sharp. Don’t be late or you
won’t get dessert.

_I walk to my room to wash my hands. There is no television there, no
phone, and no technology except a small stereo. It used to be the
Beatles whose music soothed me, but now that I’m a little older and my
voice is starting to change, hardcore seems to fit my temperament
better._

_I’m in the mood to play the Damned’s “Smash It Up,” but I smashed the
record in a fit of anger after I was grounded for a weekend for putting
my feet up on the kitchen counter. So instead I crank Suicidal
Tendencies as loud as I can without getting into trouble: “They just
keep bugging me and they just keep bugging me and it builds up inside.”_

_And I wash my hands. Like a good son._

_A few minutes before six, I hear my mom’s voice:_

Dinnertime.

_I enter the kitchen and see her sitting at the far end of the table, my
father on her left, and my brother at the end closest to me. I’m the
last to arrive, as usual. The black sheep. I sit down in my appointed
seat._

Neil, elbows off the table. Ivan, you too!

_Her voice is gentle for me, but harsh for my father. He is the blacker
sheep. I feel bad for him. But my mom constantly tells me, “You’re your
father’s favorite,” as if that’s a bad thing, so I try not to show him
any sympathy._

You’ll never believe what your father did to me this time. He told Robin
in his office that we were going to Sarasota for vacation. I have half a
mind to just cancel the trip. You two haven’t told anyone, have you?

No, Mom. Of course not. But it isn’t . . .

_When everyone in school brags about where they’re traveling for
Christmas break, it’s hard not to tell them where I’m going. But my
mother forbids it. She’s worried that while we’re gone, someone will
break into the house. Before every trip, she hooks up lights to timers
to fool all the criminals she imagines lurking outside. My father and I
then leave the house and pretend to wave goodbye to my mother and
brother. Afterward, they wait until the coast is clear, then sneak into
a taxi to follow us. Even at my age, I know we have very little to
steal: just two small television sets, two stereos, and one VCR._

_I’m also not permitted to know my mother’s age, where she went to
school, what her past jobs were, or why her leg is deformed. And I’m not
allowed to have keys to the house—and never will be—because she’s
worried I’ll lose them. However, my brother is sometimes trusted with
the keys to the house. It doesn’t seem very . . ._

_. . ._ fair. Sam’s going to Jamaica and he’s allowed to tell everyone.

_I’ve always been jealous of Sam. His parents are divorced and he’s a
latchkey kid, which means he gets the keys to his house. He can also
stay up as late as he wants. Until recently, my bedtime was seven
thirty._

Well, Sam’s parents don’t care what happens to him. And he’s just like
his parents. I don’t want you hanging out with Sam, Neil. He has a big
mouth. Anything you tell him, everyone in the neighborhood is going to
know. Do you understand me?

Yes, Mom.

He’s not your real friend anyway. Now what did I tell you about
switching your fork to your other hand after cutting your meat?

. . .

That’s better. Who’s your mother who loves you very much?

You are.

_As I write the family rules on my timeline, I suddenly realize: No
wonder I hate monogamy. It’s just another irrational rule I have to put
up with._

19

In the art room the next morning, I quickly finish my last rule—“Don’t
trust other people: They are out to hurt you”—and race to join the guys
in group therapy. Joan storms into the room a few minutes later carrying
a stapled printout. My picture is on it. She looks at me and blurts,
“Are you here for research?”

“Research?”

“I looked you up online. I know who you are.” She seemed merely to
dislike me before, but now she may actually hate me. She knows what I’ve
written: articles and books about sex-crazed rockers, porn stars, and
players. A sex addict’s oeuvre. And evidently she thinks my sole purpose
here is to undermine her.

“I’m one hundred percent here for me,” I tell her truthfully. What I
don’t tell her is that if I were undercover writing about sex addiction,
I wouldn’t be in this genital detention camp. I’d be with the sex
addicts in the real world—having fun in Thai go-go bars and Brazilian
termas and German FKK clubs.

“The truth is, this is the last chance for me to have a normal
relationship,” I continue. “If I can’t be convinced that monogamy is
natural and healthy, and wanting to be with multiple women is a symptom
of dysfunction and trauma, I don’t think I’ll ever want a regular
marriage.”

Joan’s arms are folded. She studies my every micro-expression closely,
waiting to see if I’ll smile or break eye contact or show any sign that
I’m lying. When I don’t, she clucks sharply, “Are you aware that any man
who courts a woman with the goal of having sex is an addict?”

I tell her I wasn’t aware of that, and she goes on to explain that
couples should have seventeen dates and fully get to know each other
before initiating any physical contact.

But sex, I think, is part of getting to know someone. What if you commit
to a relationship and she’s horrible in bed, smells like balsamic
vinegar, and refuses to give blow jobs?

She waits for me to challenge her, but this time I keep my thoughts to
myself. She then uncrosses her arms and nods her head. “Go ahead and
present your timeline.”

I unroll the butcher paper—it’s the size I was when I was ten—and sit on
the floor next to it. I tell her about the rules, the paranoia, the
punishments—and the tough but compassionate babysitter who came to live
with us when I was two and became like a second mother to me. When I get
to the story about my mom’s wish that my brother and I cremate her and
leave no memorial, my face swells and I feel tears approaching.

Joan responds to the possibility of tears in the room like a shark to
the scent of blood in the water. “What are you feeling?” she asks, as if
inviting me to cry. She has me right where she wants me: submissive,
vulnerable, open.

“Pain,” I tell her. “Because just saying that makes me realize how sad
she must be inside, how lonely and empty she must feel that she just
wants to disappear from the world without any trace of her existence
left behind.”

I inhale, clamp down on my emotions, and try to suck back the tears
through the sides of my eyes. I will give Joan the story, but I won’t
give her my soul. I don’t trust her with it.

When we move into my teenage years, I tell her about my parents never
trusting me with the keys to the house, not letting me go on my
first-ever date, and grounding me for most of my high school years.

And then, suddenly, I stop presenting my timeline. I’ve reached the part
I’ve been dreading.

“I have a family skeleton in the closet here,” I explain. “But I
promised my mother I’d never tell anyone about it. So I don’t know what
to do. I don’t want to lie or break that promise.”

“This is _your_ recovery,” Joan replies. “And you’re as sick as your
secrets. You can’t keep old promises if they’re not healthy for you.”

“Yes, but I have my own value system. Just like we’ve taken a pledge of
anonymity here, I pledged secrecy to my mother.”

“Then we will all make a pledge of secrecy to you,” she says. And they
all promise.

“One more thing,” I add.

“Just say it,” she snaps, annoyed.

I ask more questions, buying time so I can determine what’s right. I
crave the release, but I dread the betrayal. And then, as I look at the
faces of the other guys who’ve shared their secrets in this room, I
decide that, after two decades, I just need to let it go. Maybe it’s
been holding me back, keeping me stuck in the past and riddled with
confusion. And so I share what I’ve never told anyone—not Ingrid, not
even my brother.

“Okay. So one day, I was in my father’s closet looking for porn.” The
words start slowly, as if waking from a deep slumber. “And I found this
videotape. The first thing on it was a tennis game with people in
wheelchairs. Then there was a clip from a movie with a woman in a
wheelchair begging in the streets for change. Then a swimming race with
these people with no limbs just wriggling in the water. And at the end
were all these old film clips of”—it’s hard to go on; everyone is
silent—“amputees. All these models in bathing suits with missing legs
and shit. That’s when I first realized”—again, my throat tries to choke
the words back down—“my father’s got a thing for cripples.”

The words fly out between tears and spittle. “And my mom’s a fucking
cripple. She had no idea he had this obsession when she married him.
That’s why she hates him so much. She thinks she’s like the prize of his
collection.”

I tell the group that after I found the video, I asked my mom about it.
She seemed relieved she had someone to talk about it with and told me
what she already knew about his obsession, like the pictures she’d found
of my father when he was younger, bending limbs behind his back to look
like an amputee. Eventually, we began investigating him together, and we
found detailed inventories that he’d made of his photo collection of men
and women with different amputations and birth defects.

Everyone in the room is silent, even Joan. I press on, telling them that
my mom’s never told my dad that she knows about this, that she made me
promise never to say a word about it to anyone, that she constantly
calls me to discuss new evidence she’s found, that she’s paranoid that
he has cameras hidden in the house to record her, that she believes he
meets regularly with a secret club of men who share his fixation, that
she thinks he brings them photos of her and random disabled people he
photographs in the streets, that she has such an overwhelming feeling of
shame that she won’t allow herself to be photographed and thinks anyone
who stares at her must have a thing for her bad leg.

“She even found a film of their honeymoon he’d edited so that it only
contained scenes of her limping.” I talk and talk and don’t stop
talking. “I try to tell my mom that if she were a blonde with big
breasts, people would stare and take photos and she wouldn’t have a
complex about it, so she should just think of it as an attractive
feature.”

And finally, when the story is as exhausted as I am, I skid to a halt
and return to my body.

“Was that so bad?” Joan asks.

I want to answer: Yes, it was that bad. I don’t feel unburdened at all.
I’m still carrying the secret; the only difference is that now nine
proven liars also know it. I feel vulnerable and sick to my stomach.

“Are you aware that sex addiction has a genetic component?” she goes on.

“I don’t know.” I wish I hadn’t told her: She’s already using it against
me. Just like my mom warned me people would do.

“I know,” she says firmly, as if a point has been proven. “However,
there’s an issue here that’s even bigger than your father’s addiction
and him leaking that energy all over the house.”

“What do you mean?” My face is crimson from fear, guilt, stress,
fatigue.

“It’s your bond with your mother—the way you keep secrets for her, the
way you both investigated him together.” I can perceive the faint
outline of something important on the horizon of her words, but I can’t
seem to identify it. “If you put what you just shared together with all
the other pieces of your childhood, a clear pattern emerges.”

“Which is what?”

She starts to speak, then stops herself. “I don’t know how you’re going
to take this.”

“Just say it,” I snap, imitating her, just to be an asshole.

This gives her the resolve she needs. She sucks in a breath of air, then
exhales. “Okay, I’ll just say it.” The pause is long, the room is quiet,
my heart is hammering, and then she says it. “Your mom wants to be in a
relationship with you.”

It hits me like a ton of bricks. I sit there dazed, and a cold wind
blows from somewhere inside me. Images from my life flutter in the
current, each one a disturbing fragment of evidence: Why else would my
mom come into my room at night and tell me all her problems? Why else
would she not let me go on my first date? Why else was I grounded all
the time and told that my classmates weren’t really my friends? Why else
wasn’t I allowed the keys to the house when my brother was? Why else did
she cut off all support and communication when I moved in with my first
girlfriend, even though I was in my twenties? And what was I in this
whole investigation of my father if not her intimate partner?

The tears come fast now. The statement seems so preposterous, yet
something in my body recognizes the truth in it.

Joan’s got me. She’s won. The pride, the ego, the defenses, the
algebraic equations are all gone. I am at her mercy. And that’s when she
hammers once more on the stake she’s just driven into me: “That’s why
you’re unable to be in a healthy relationship.”

“Now it makes sense why there was a double standard between my brother
and me,” I choke out between sobs, regressing with each one. “Like,
after college, he could have his girlfriends spend the night at my
parents’ place, but I never could. Even to this day.”

“And why was that?”

“She said they were never good enough for me. That I chose badly.”

“It’s not that you chose badly.” She’s found the blood in the water now.
“It’s that you didn’t choose Mom.”

My head is spinning. My mom didn’t do this intentionally, I’m sure, but
it was unconscious. She hated Dad, she didn’t trust her friends, and I
was the oldest, most reliable male around. So she probably wanted me all
to herself, or at least safely under her control.

“When your mom is emotionally dependent on you and has intimate
discussions with you that she should be having with her spouse, there’s
a name for that.” Joan looks at me like a prizefighter sizing up a dazed
opponent, then lands her final blow. “It’s called emotional incest.”

And I’m done.

Mexico City, Many Years Earlier

_“R_eady for school, princess?” her father asked.

She glanced up at him. He was wearing a dark suit and looked like a
movie star. An actor. She hated it when he talked to her like that. He
had no right. He was rarely around and had never taken her to school
before.

He bent down and found her hand. She let it lie limply in his, like
dough in an oven. She couldn’t remember ever feeling the warmth of his
hand before.

Instead of taking her to the front door of the school, he led her to an
alley alongside the building, where he met a short-haired brunette woman
in a pencil skirt with high heels. He kissed her, but not the way the
girl’s grandmother kissed people. They kissed like lovers in the movies.

In the days that followed, she conducted an investigation of her father,
like in the detective shows she’d seen on TV. In an evidence box
underneath her bed, she collected her father’s beeper, full of messages
from random women; his scheduling book, documenting appointments with
them; and, finally, tape recordings her father was secretly making of
her mother talking on the phone.

When she was ready to make her case, she sat her mother down and handed
her the box. The little girl was nervous, not because of the effect it
would have on her mom, but because the phone recordings contained
evidence that she and her brother had been prank-calling the butcher.
(“Hello . . . do you have pig’s feet?” “Yes.” “Why don’t you wash them!”
_Click_.)

Her mother didn’t say a word as she went through the box. First she
looked confused, then uncomfortable, and finally she started crying.

The next day, her mother started her own investigation. In addition to
discovering that her husband had several girlfriends on the side, she
found out that not only had he never divorced his previous wife, but he
was actually still living with her—and having more children with her. So
she confronted her husband about his double life and told him it was
over between them.

That night, the little girl was woken by screaming and a loud crash from
her parents’ bedroom. She ran to their door and pushed against it, but
it was blocked by a broomstick. The doorknob had fallen off a few weeks
back, so she looked through the hole to see what was going on.

Her father was sitting on top of her mother, his face red and twisted as
if possessed. His hands were over her mother’s mouth and nose, squeezing
tightly. She struggled to breathe, her hands clawing at his. Her eyes,
grotesquely enlarged, appeared to turn toward the little girl, pleading,
“Help me!”

“Please don’t kill her!” the little girl yelled between sobs as she
tried to open the door. She rushed to her older brother’s room and woke
him up, and he ran into the hallway and slammed his body against the
door. Over and over again.

As the door burst open, her father released his grip from her mother’s
face and backed away, telling his children that they were just playing.
Her mother stumbled toward her—gasping violently, her face pale blue,
her eyes blood red—and the little girl grabbed her hand and ran into the
bathroom with her. She locked the door, and the two of them cried
together.

The boy ran to the phone to call their mom’s brothers. They were all big
men and very protective of their sister. But as the boy was yelling
“Help!” into the receiver, his father tore the cord out of the wall,
pulled open the window of their fourth-floor apartment, and threw the
phone outside.

Ten minutes later, the girl emerged from the bathroom. The house was
completely still. She heard classical music coming from the kitchen.
There, she saw her dad sitting at the table, his legs crossed
gracefully. He was holding a glass of cognac, swirling it slowly, gazing
at it with a look of complete peace as he breathed in the notes of the
drink, the music, the night air.

She yanked the needle off the record. “What are you doing?!” she yelled,
furious, confused, terrified.

“I’m waiting for my death to arrive,” he said calmly.

That was the last time Ingrid saw her father.

21

I wake up alone in the rehab dorm, the sun diffusing through a small
dirt-filmed window, the muffled mating calls of birds and cicadas
announcing another morning, and a raging hard-on pressing against my
boxer shorts.

My mind drifts to an image of Carrie and the suggestive way she handed
me her note. I remember she’s roommates with Dawn and I start picturing
a threesome with them. I think about how her caretaking qualities must
extend to the bedroom and I imagine her using her breasts in considerate
ways. Some guys are ass men; others are into breasts, legs, or faces. My
theory is that it has to do with the sexual position you prefer. If you
like it doggy style and you’re looking at a woman’s ass when you come,
you’re going to associate your sexual pleasure with that part of her
body. If you like missionary, maybe you’re a face man. And if you like
her on top, you’ve usually got an eyeful and a handful of breasts when
you orgasm. And if . . . fuck, I just made a mess in my boxer shorts.

I waddle to the bathroom and wipe up. I feel like an alcoholic who’s
smuggled a fifth of vodka into rehab and just guzzled it.

As I get ready for the day, I think about a book Rick Rubin once showed
me. It was about a seventies commune called the Source Family, which was
run by a bank robber, vegetarian-restaurant owner, and aspiring rock
star known as Father Yod. In the book, there was a photo of him—looking
eerily like Rick—sitting outdoors in his commune in the Hollywood Hills
with thirteen of his hippie wives and lovers gathered around him, at
least two of them pregnant with his children.

[image]

And I wonder what it would be like to live in an environment of open and
unrestricted sexuality, with friends and lovers coming in and out
freely, no one claiming ownership of another’s body as if it were a
personal possession.

That’s when I realize why today, of all days, my mind is spinning out of
control: It’s Sunday and Ingrid is coming. The force of light, monogamy,
stability, marriage, children, and a normal life is on her way. And now
my “disease” is blossoming like mold.

Check-in: guilt. And shame.

Guilt is about making a mistake. Shame is about being a mistake.

And fear.

Two days earlier, when I was lying in a puddle in group therapy,
seething over the violence of the phrase _emotional incest,_ Joan
suggested a couple of things. The first was that I call Ingrid and tell
her what I’d learned about myself and why I’d cheated on her. The second
was that I ask my parents to come for family week to work on healing our
trauma and dysfunctional relationships with one another.

As I masturbated, Ingrid was driving hundreds of miles to see me for the
first time in weeks and talk about my recently diagnosed intimacy
issues. I think of her driving so far all alone, and I’m touched she
would do that for me after what I did to her. And how do I show my
gratitude? By plotting orgies.

I’m not a bad person, I tell myself. I’m just scared of intimacy.

Unlike reaching out to Ingrid, calling my parents and telling them I was
in rehab for sex addiction wasn’t liable to be greeted with the same
degree of support. So, like anyone faced with doing something
emotionally difficult, I put it off until later.

Every Sunday, all patients are required to attend family-week
graduation. So I walk across the property to a large classroom, where a
dozen addicts and trauma survivors sit with their families in the front
of the room. One after another, sons, daughters, parents, siblings, and
spouses stand up and talk about how the week has begun a much-needed
healing process for them.

“A lot of times, people in a family think it’s just one person who
causes all the trouble,” Lorraine, the therapist who lectured us on
trauma, is telling the assembly. “But a family is a system, and a sick
person is the product of a sick system.”

As the ceremony continues, I feel a dry, sticky crunching in my navel
hair. Evidently I didn’t wash away my sins well enough. I look around to
see if it’s possible to slip away, but then the freckly woman from
Henry’s rape-and-incest meeting rises from her seat and turns to face
us. She’s wearing black slacks and a blue cardigan, and looks much less
sallow than before—almost upbeat, bordering on charismatic. She’s
standing next to a man in his late sixties with a large red face, a
porcine body, and huge, crevassed hands. It is the adoptive father who
molested her.

I don’t sense any hatred from her, nor any warmth. Someone looking at a
photo of the two of them might think it was of a schoolteacher giving an
old janitor an award for forty years of dedicated service.

“If some of you remember, when I first arrived, I was very depressed and
cried a lot and thought about killing myself,” she is saying. “I don’t
think I talked to anyone for my first two days here. But thanks to
family week, I feel like a human being again.”

She turns to her father and everyone sits stock-still, waiting to hear
what he has to say. “It was very hard for me to make the decision to
come here,” he says. No shit: You’re staring at a room full of trauma
survivors who hate you. “I feel very bad about what I’ve done. And I
think Laura is an incredibly brave woman for being here and for allowing
me to be here. I know nothing I can do or say will take away the past,
but I’m happy that Laura can have a future now. I think I’ve grown more
as a person with the therapists here than I have in my entire life.”

Listening to him, I resolve to call my parents. Since the day I left
home for college, I’ve called my mom nearly every Sunday; the few times
that I haven’t, she’s given me a guilt trip to remember. And it is a
Sunday.

Besides, if this woman could invite the monster who molested her to
come, then surely I can ask a woman who merely grounded me a lot. Not
only would it be good for my parents to face the truth—my mother and I
have never told my dad that we know his secret—but maybe the family
healing will relieve me of whatever is hanging over my head and standing
in the way of having a happy, honest relationship.

Rehab, One Hour Later

You’re not a sex addict, you’re a man. If someone wants to play with
you, you’re not going to walk away. What are you, a dork? You’re going
to play back.

_The voice belongs to my mother._

Yes, but not when I’m in a relationship.

In my book, that’s how men do it. I believe in honesty in relationships,
but if you’re going to cheat, you gotta keep it to yourself. As a woman,
I’ve been asked out for coffee a couple of times and I say no thanks.
But that’s because I’m a woman and that’s not my nature. Though if he
were a multimillionaire and he wasn’t married, maybe I’d get coffee with
him.

_As I listen to her talk, I’m floored. I’ve never heard her views on
fidelity before, except when she’s disclosing the latest piece of
evidence supporting her conviction that my father is having an affair.
Yet here she is on the phone, making the exact same argument I’ve been
making all week—except she’s doing it her way._

_She continues . . ._

I don’t think you need treatment. Everything about you is going to be in
those hospital files for the rest of your life and the world is going to
know about it. All you’re addicted to is life and living it.

It’s too late now. But I’m learning some things that will help my life.
And the week after next, they have something called family week, when
the parents of the people here visit. It really completes the healing
process and I wanted to see if both of you could come for it.

To go there would be useless.

I really need you and Dad here. It would mean so much to me. And it
would help me a lot.

Listen, you’re an unusual but normal person. If it were a life or death
situation, we’d do it.

_My father is also on the phone, but he doesn’t say a word—except to
apologize when my mother tells him he’s breathing too loudly into the
handset. No wonder I’m scared of marriage. Whenever someone I’m dating
starts treating me worse than they treat a stranger, that’s always the
beginning of the end for me._

What if I have a therapist from here call you and explain why it’s
important?

Don’t you dare give anyone my phone number.

Okay. Please, Mom. I don’t know what to say.

There’s nothing you can say. Physically, it’s just very difficult to
travel.

If they have therapists in Chicago they recommend, can we all go see one
together?

I don’t think so. There’s nothing we could do or add. We don’t feel you
have a problem. Whatever problem you have, you know and we know.

It would help us connect. Remember my ex-girlfriend Lisa? When she saw
us together, she said it didn’t seem like there was any warmth or love
between us.

Lisa was just with us for one meal. I wasn’t comfortable with her. She
wasn’t friendly or smiling. She didn’t relate to us at all.

_Joan’s words ring in my head as she speaks: another example of the
women I date not being good enough for my mother. The implicit message
is that sex and affairs are okay, but don’t get a real girlfriend
because that would be competition._

_I try using her own weapon against her: guilt._

As a mother, it would be one of the best things you could ever do for
me.

How would it help you exactly?

It would help me be happier, healthier, and capable of having a
functional relationship and starting a family of my own.

Charlie Aaron didn’t get married until he was in his seventies, and he
was never happier. And he didn’t need any kids.

_My breath catches in my throat. I’ve never heard of a mother who didn’t
want to be a grandmother. Every word coming out of her mouth seems to
support Joan’s horrific diagnosis._

But remember Irvin from high school? He said he didn’t even know the
meaning of the word love until he became a father.

Irvin was your brother’s friend?

No, he was my friend.

That’s not possible. You were a dork. You didn’t have any friends.

_Why would a mother ever say that to her son? I wonder. Then I realize
that I just recently learned the answer: She’s keeping me in my place. I
beg and plead for them to come, countering objection after objection,
until she says flatly . . ._

I have some really valid reasons why we can’t come. We love you, and
we’d do anything else for you.

_Hard to believe that right now._

Can just Dad come then?

No way, José.

_He says nothing. He has no voice in the relationship. I try one last
angle, my ace in the hole: promising to keep the secret._

Whatever you’re worried about, and I think I know what it is, we don’t
have to discuss that.

I know who I am. I know who my parents are. I had an idyllic childhood.
I think I turned out to be a great mother with two wonderful kids. I
wouldn’t change you an ounce. But if you’re not satisfied with you, then
you can help you by yourself. I’m not coming for personal reasons—very
personal—and that’s it! Tell them not to call.

_The words fall like a sledgehammer, breaking the ground around me,
isolating me, sending me spinning off into space alone. I reach for a
lifeline._

Can I ask you to just send me a copy of the keys to the house instead?
They said it would give me a sense of closure if I could wear them
around my neck as a symbol that I can be trusted.

_I realize that since leaving home for college, I’ve always had an odd
key fixation. I’ve never thrown one away, even to old dorm rooms, cars,
and apartments._

Sorry, Charlie. It’s not you, it’s me. I don’t feel safe. And, besides,
you’re absentminded. You lost that tape recorder when you were twelve
and a million other things. And I can’t endanger my feeling of safety.

Okay, thanks for listening. Bye, Mom.

We can hire two people and send them to family week instead if you want.

That’s okay.

Enjoy your incarceration.

_The world I once knew, the one I thought I grew up in—strict, yes, but
full of love and sacrifice from the parents who conceived, nurtured, and
supported me—is gone. What she’s saying, ultimately, is that her issues
are more important than my well-being. And they always have been._

_It could be worse, though. At least she has a sense of humor._

23

I shower for a second time, making sure to use a washcloth, soap, and
pressure, then trudge to a men’s circle in progress on the lawn. The
thirty or so guys there are using what they call a talking stick, and
only the person holding the erect-cock-sized piece of wood can speak.
When he’s done, he says “aho,” which is some sort of macho Native
American sound, and hands the wooden dick to the next lunatic.

“Hi, I’m Calvin and I’m a sex addict. And I’m feeling a lot of fear
right now, but also joy, because Mariana”—the Brazilian prostitute he
impregnated—“just told me she wants to keep the baby. Aho!”

He hands me the stick. It’s my turn to check in and I want to get it
over with quickly: “I’m Neil and I’m tired of labels and I’m fine. Aho!”

Everyone sucks in air or exclaims “ooooh” like I’ve just stepped in
shit.

“What?” I ask.

Charles gestures for me to hand him the stick. I shake my head in
annoyance and hand it to him. Idiotic rule.

“Fine stands for fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional,” he says.

“That’s about right.”

The men glare at me in silent accusation: I spoke without holding the
talking stick. You’d think I just shot someone.

Charles hands me the talking dick and I place it on the ground next to
me. “I love how someone can just make up a random fucking rule and you
all follow it like sheep,” I tell them as I walk off. “I’ve been in a
fucking men’s circle all week anyway. Aho!”

No one responds because no one is holding the talking stick.

I’m aware, as I walk away, that I’m not really mad at them. And I’m not
mad at the talking stick. It’s actually a decent rule. If I’d had the
chance to speak uninterrupted as a child and express myself and truly be
heard, I’d probably be much healthier.

What I’m mad about is that some people’s parents _can’t_ come to family
week because they’re dead or broke or in prison, but my parents just
_won’t_. A guy who molested his daughter has the balls to show up here.
As for my father, he doesn’t even have the balls to speak up for himself
on the phone.

Check-in: fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional. And rethinking
everything I thought I knew about my childhood, my life, and who I am.

The perfect frame of mind to see Ingrid after all this time apart.

24

She is too pure for this place.

She stands in the nurses’ area, where I’m now allowed the occasional use
of my razor under supervision only. She’s wearing a fitted blue plaid
button-down shirt that’s open to reveal a triangle of flawless skin, and
black jeans that stop just above her high heels. No one wears high heels
in this place. It’s not healthy for the fragile libidos here.

She stiffens as she sees me and everything comes up at once in her
face—the love, the hate, the desire, the fear, the hope, the hurt—and
pushes through the scab covering it all.

The words “Oh my god” escape from her mouth. Then the tears roll. When
we hug, it seems like she’s dissolving into me. But when I feel her
shirt rubbing against my chafed navel, a sense of unworthiness sweeps
over me. Here I am, lusting after every slightly attractive inpatient I
see, while she’s come all this way hoping I’ve changed. I guess I’m here
because I want to be as good a person as Ingrid is.

What I’m feeling right now is another symptom of my trauma. It’s shame
again. I am putting myself one down.

Where I belong.

Suddenly, a fragment of my past comes rushing back. I’m a teenager lying
in bed, imagining what my life will be like in the future. It’s always
the same scene:

My brother is living in a large suburban house with a big green lawn and
a beautiful blond wife. I visit and ask if I can stay for a while
because I have nowhere else to go. My clothes are dirty and wrinkled,
and my face is unshaven. I crash on his couch, emitting a funny smell
and watching TV, until one day his perfectly put-together wife asks him,
as politely as can be, “Is your brother ever going to get a job? He
can’t stay on this couch forever.”

And now, two decades later, I actually manage to achieve the happy life
I never thought possible—a home, a job, a girlfriend oddly similar to
the wife I imagined my brother with—and I wreck it. It’s as if the
prediction didn’t come true, so I willed it to be. I fucked it to life.

“What are you thinking about?” Ingrid asks.

“I’m just happy you’re here.”

There’s an energy between us. It’s a stronger feeling than I get with
anyone else, like the pull of two magnets held just slightly apart.
“What’s in your hand?” she asks.

“It’s my timeline. I want to explain it to you, so you can know who I
am.”

We walk to the lawn and sit in the grass near where the men’s circle
was. It’s just below the patient lounge and I notice the sex addicts
clustered along the outdoor benches above. They also seem taken in by
Ingrid’s magnetism. I wonder if they’re thinking of being with their
wives or of cheating on their wives.

Ingrid listens closely as I walk her through each event on my timeline.
But when I reveal the punch line—emotional incest—she strains to
understand. “How is that incest?”

“I know. I hate the term. Everything is diagnosed as some sort of
crippling psychological disorder here.” It feels so good to be talking
with her, sharing with her, smelling her again that, despite the subject
matter, I’m giddy with happiness. “But this is what pertains to us: They
say here that if you tell them what kind of relationship you had with
your opposite-sex parent as a child, they can tell you what kind of
romantic relationship you’re going to have as an adult. Unless you’re
gay, in which case it would be the same-sex parent.”

“I don’t know. That sounds oversimplified.”

“Maybe it is. I have no idea what’s true anymore.” Ever since presenting
my timeline, my head’s been a mess. So I explain to Ingrid what I’ve
learned since that afternoon . . .

They say here that there are three ways of raising children. The first
is functional bonding, in which the parents or primary caregivers love,
nurture, affirm, set healthy limits with, and take care of the needs of
the child. I turn over my timeline and sketch it for her:

[image]

This creates a child who has healthy, secure self-esteem and
relationships.

But then there’s neglect, when a caregiver abandons, is detached from,
or doesn’t appropriately nurture the child. This can range from a parent
who isn’t physically present, to a parent who is physically present but
emotionally distant, to a parent who doesn’t provide adequate care or
safety, to a parent lost in a work, sex, gambling, alcohol, or other
addiction. If you grew up feeling unwanted by or unimportant to a
parent, this is a sign that neglect likely occurred:

[image]

This creates wounded children, who are often depressed and indecisive,
see themselves as flawed and less valuable than others, and feel they
can’t face the world alone. In relationships, they tend to have what’s
called anxious attachment. They may feel like they’re not enough for
their partners; become so wrapped up in their relationships that they
lose sight of their own needs and self-worth; and be emotionally
intense, passive-aggressive, or in need of constant reassurance that
they’re not being abandoned. Here, they call this type of person a love
addict.

As Ingrid listens intently, I look for any recognition in her eyes.
After all, she was abandoned by her father throughout her childhood,
even before he tried to kill her mother and narrowly escaped her uncles.
When I see none, I move on to explain the third type of parenting:
enmeshment. This is my upbringing.

Instead of taking care of a child’s needs, the enmeshing parent tries to
get his or her own needs met through the child. This can take various
forms: a parent who lives through a child’s accomplishments; who makes
the child a surrogate spouse, therapist, or caretaker; who is depressed
and emotionally uses the child; who is overbearing or overcontrolling;
or who is excessively emotional or anxious about a child. If you grew up
feeling sorry for or smothered by a parent, this is a sign that
enmeshment likely occurred:

[image]

In the process, enmeshed children lose their sense of self. As adults,
they usually avoid letting anyone get too close and suck the life out of
them again. Where the abandoned are often unable to contain their
feelings, the enmeshed tend to be cut off from them, and be
perfectionistic and controlling of themselves and others. Though they
may pursue a relationship thinking they want connection, once they’re in
the reality of one, they often put up walls, feel superior, and use
other distancing techniques to avoid intimacy. This is known as avoidant
attachment—or, as they put it here, love avoidance. And most sex
addicts, according to this theory, are love avoidants.

I tell Ingrid that I asked if there was a fourth category for physically
or sexually abusive parenting, but was told that this could register on
a child as either neglectful or enmeshing. They explained that a rule of
thumb to use is that when a parent’s abuse disempowers a child, that’s
neglect; when it’s falsely empowering, that’s enmeshment.

Ingrid blinks back tears, places her rock-paper-scissors-playing hand
warmly over mine, and says, “I would give up anything to see you healed
and free of the enmeshment that’s keeping you from living.”

In the past, I would have thought this was the most beautiful thing in
the world to say. Now, instead, I worry that wanting to give up
“anything” for someone else’s happiness is a dysfunctional symptom of
love addiction and codependence. Then I worry that being scared by her
selfless caring is a symptom of my own love avoidance. They’re really
screwing up my mind in here.

“I’m working hard on it,” I tell her. Wait, that’s not completely true.
“Some of the stuff here is a little too over-the-top for me, though.”
That’s better.

“I think this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to you,”
she responds. And for the first time since I cheated on her, I see the
light return to her eyes.

“Do you really think so?”

“I know it. I’ve never told you this, but I was in rehab for two years.”

25

“So all you really want in a relationship is freedom?” Ingrid asks as we
walk to the cafeteria for dinner later that day.

“Yeah, I think so.”

“I’d like to give you more freedom, then.”

“Really?”

“Yes, starting now.” She grabs my jeans playfully and starts pulling
them down. “This is what freedom feels like!” An impish smile, which
I’ve sorely missed, spreads across her face. “Why don’t you show
everyone here your freedom?” she mocks, pulling next at my boxer shorts.

I yank the waistband up to keep from exposing myself: If Joan saw this,
she’d probably add _compulsive exhibitionist_ to my permanent record.
But Ingrid keeps fighting to remove my clothing, yelling “Freedom!” at
the top of her lungs.

We walk into the cafeteria, grinning ear to ear. She’s making a joke out
of the issue all us red demons have been tying ourselves in knots over.
Perhaps the best cure is just to lighten up. I don’t need Zoloft. I have
her.

“Miss, you’re going to have to button your shirt higher,” the
dining-hall counselor and anorexic-feeder barks when he sees her, as if
the sex addicts are going to break into spontaneous public masturbation
when they see that extra inch of cleavage.

We each grab a plate of flavorless chicken parts over soapy rice and
walk to the sex addict table. Troy claps me on the back and says
idiotically, “You didn’t tell us how hot she was.” Maybe the counselor
was right after all.

Charles doesn’t leave the table as we sit down, which means visitors are
presumably exempt from the “males only” rule. Ingrid asks each guy in
the group about his story and each speaks freely of his sins, except for
Charles.

Then she tells them her family’s story: “My grandfather cheated on my
grandmother all the time, but she always loved him. After he died, she
started having recurring nightmares about him cheating. So every
morning, she goes to his room and yells at his ashes, ‘_Dios mío_! Even
in death you are still cheating on me. Can’t you let me be, you dirty
old man?’” The guys laugh all too knowingly. “Then, a few hours later,
she returns, apologizes, dusts the room, and refreshes the flowers on
his nightstand.”

And so, even in death, in relationship with a memory, the ballad of the
love addict and love avoider continues.

Ingrid’s mother was just as obsessive a love addict. “She used to be
beautiful and independent and have her own TV show in Mexico, but when
we moved to America, she became a domestic slave to my stepfather,”
Ingrid tells the guys. “I’d try to get her to leave him because he was
so emotionally abusive, but she’d always say, ‘I can’t. What am I going
to do when you both turn eighteen? I’m going to be left alone.’”

“Maybe that’s the female dilemma,” Troy cuts in. “She marries someone
who’s giving her love and romance, but over time she gets taken for
granted or turned into a maid or becomes a baby factory or gets cheated
on. There’s not a single emotional need of hers that’s filled by her
husband. Then he has the nerve to complain that she’s not sexual or
attractive when he’s drained the life out of her.”

As the guys nod in sad recognition, Ingrid quickly summarizes her
teenage years, some of which she’d never shared even with me before: Her
stepfather treated her worse than a servant—making her do backbreaking
work, refusing to let her dine at the table with the rest of the family,
and giving her an unheated garage without any furniture as a room.
Ingrid soon slid from a straight-A student to a straight-F student.

Eventually, she ran away, started doing meth, and spent two years living
in rehab because her stepfather wouldn’t let her back in the house. She
ended up becoming the youth spokesperson for the treatment center,
appearing on the news and speaking at events with the mayor.

Yet despite separating from her family and accomplishing so much on her
own afterward, she still followed in her mother and grandmother’s
footsteps and fell in love with a cheater.

After dinner, the anorexic-feeder curtly tells Ingrid that visiting
hours are over. As we head back to reception, Henry, my new friend from
the art room, falls in step with us and starts speaking in his slow
monotone, ignoring Ingrid. “They talk about how there are eight emotions
here, but I think there are nine.”

“What’s the other one?”

“The ninth emotion is the death emotion. It’s just feeling nothing.”

We’re fragile beings, I think as I see the pain in his face. Even when
the body heals, the soul remains scarred. As we talk, he slowly becomes
aware of Ingrid’s presence and asks if she’s my girlfriend.

I turn to Ingrid and our eyes search each other’s for an answer. I’ve
done my penance and shown a willingness to change by checking in here;
she’s shown her forgiveness by driving here to see me and sharing her
own secrets.

“Yes,” she tells him. “I am.”

Relief and gratitude flow through me. I’m done fantasizing about the
women here. I’ve been given a second chance not to be Ingrid’s father
and grandfather—or to be them and perpetuate the multigenerational
pattern of cheating men and the women who love them. The sins of the
parents are the destinies of their children. Unless the children wake up
and do something about it.

“I trust your boyfriend,” Henry says. “I feel like I can talk to him.”

Of course he can, I think. I must give out some sort of enmeshment
signal, letting everyone know they can confide their crazy shit in me.
That’s probably why I ended up profiling rock stars for _Rolling Stone,_
why all those mistrustful celebrities felt comfortable divulging private
thoughts to me that they’d never shared with anyone else, why my editors
clapped me on the back afterward and put the story on the cover.

Childhood trauma may sneak up from behind and fuck you in the ass when
you grow up, but at least it leaves a tip on the nightstand.

“Who was that poor guy?” Ingrid asks as Henry drifts away, talking about
his latest suicide plan: He’s identified the most dangerous patient here
and is planning to pick a fight with him.

“He had sex with a horse.”

“And the horse got jealous and told his wife?” she jokes, though there’s
a barb in there that I ignore.

As we hug goodbye in reception, I try to imprint the softness of her
breasts against my chest, the ridges of her spine beneath my fingertips,
the warmth of her cheek against mine, so I can remember them when I get
weak.

“My biggest wish is that you find your inner peace and happiness,” she
says as she pulls away.

“Thank you for believing in me,” I tell her—my girlfriend, my lover, my
jailer.

After she leaves, I sit on a bench outside the patient lounge and tears
come to my eyes. She seems to love me unconditionally, but I fear that I
love her conditionally. I look at her sometimes and worry that she’s
going to get wide hips like her mother, or I wonder if I’ll still be
able to make love to her when she’s fat and wrinkly. Other times, I pick
apart her existing features, looking for flaws and imperfections. The
sad thing is, I certainly have a lot more imperfections she could pick
apart: I’m short, bald, bony, and big-nosed, with huge greasy pores. I’m
lucky to have her. And I wonder: Am I even capable of love? Have I ever
truly loved anyone?

I can’t tell whether my tears are for the beauty of her love or the
sadness of my incapacity to feel worthy of it.

As a journalist, I’ve met a lot of so-called experts. Most are just
people with a little experience and a lot of confidence who’ve given
themselves a title with which they can fool the suggestible and
dim-witted. But every now and then, I come across someone who has the
experience, knowledge, and calling to be not just a teacher dispensing
information but a guide leading others to themselves. And Lorraine seems
to be one of them.

“Self-deprecation is still self-worship,” she is telling Calvin. “It’s
the flip side of the same coin. It’s still about _self_.”

It’s our second week here and the staff has divided us into smaller
groups to experience a Gestalt-like therapy they call chair work. Adam,
Calvin, Troy and I—the troublemakers—have, to our relief, been placed
under Lorraine’s care in a nearby building. And she’s in the midst of
prepping us to undergo this intense form of trauma healing.

“I suck at self-deprecation,” I whisper to Calvin.

Lorraine overhears and says sternly, “Remember that humor is a wall.
It’s a form of denial, just the same as repression, rationalization,
globalization, and minimization.”

Yes, I think she is one of those experts. It’s clear she’s dealt with
enough stupid smart people that she can read me like a book.

That afternoon, Lorraine rips open everyone’s minds. As she lectures on
the human psyche, sex addicts’ faces illuminate intermittently, like
fireworks, as they realize the origins of their behaviors, their
feelings, and the beliefs that have kept them estranged from others and
ultimately themselves.

Unlike traditional talk therapy, in which a therapist sits with a client
in an office for an hour every week for years or even decades, addiction
treatment _has_ to change people quickly. Lives are at stake. That next
drink could lead to a burst vein; that next injection could be a hot
one. What matters is what works today, not what’s been studied and
accepted by the mainstream psychiatric community. And so some say the
techniques here, many of them adapted from the decades-old work of a
former nurse, Pia Mellody, who as of this moment doesn’t even have her
own Wikipedia entry, are problematic; others say they are the pinnacle
of personal transformation—if you’re lucky enough to get the right
counselor.

And we were lucky enough to get Lorraine, the only person I’ve
encountered here so far who doesn’t seem burned out or embittered by the
Sisyphean task of healing damaged minds she can’t touch or see.

As Lorraine explains the model they use here, she asks us to take a deep
breath, listen carefully, and drift back to the way we saw our
parents—and the world—at age eight or twelve and not as we understand
them now. And this is what we hear. Maybe, if you choose to do the same,
you’ll recognize someone you know . . .

EVERYTHING THAT’S WRONG WITH YOUR BEHAVIOR AND WHY IN 1,800 WORDS OR
LESS

IN THE BEGINNING . . .

You were born.

And like all infants, you were completely vulnerable and dependent, with
a new developing brain and no understanding of the world.

IN A PERFECT WORLD . . .

Your parents would be perfect. They would be dedicated full-time to
taking care of your physical and psychological needs, always making the
right decisions, setting the healthiest boundaries, and protecting you
from all harm, while preparing you to eventually take care of your needs
without them.

BUT IN THE REAL WORLD . . .

No one is perfect. Neither your parents, nor the other people who play a
role in your upbringing. Therefore, along the way, some of your
developmental needs don’t get met.

AND THE PROBLEM IS . . .

When one of your needs doesn’t get met, however big or small, it can
leave a wound.

These wounds are known as childhood trauma. Each instance or pattern of
trauma can create specific core personal issues and relationship
challenges—and if these are left untreated, you’re likely to pass your
wounds on to the next generation. Since this trauma occurs early in
life, it can affect social, emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and moral
development.

IT’S NOT ALWAYS OVERT OR INTENTIONAL . . .

Most commonly, people think of trauma as coming from hateful
perpetrators who are knowingly and willfully abusive. But even parents
who think of themselves as loving or well-meaning make mistakes, cross
boundaries, or simply do their best with the limited internal resources
they have. And this covert, often unrecognized abuse can, through its
constant repetition, leave wounds just as deep as those created by a
single malicious act.

IT CAN BE AN EMOTIONAL SCAR . . .

In your earliest years, you’re the center of the universe. Everything
revolves around you. So wounds can come from caregivers who are either
out of control or completely detached from their emotions around you.
When Mom is always full of anxiety as she’s breast-feeding, Dad comes
home in a rage every time he has a rough day at work, or Stepdad is
depressed by his money problems during the rare moments he spends with
you, you soak up these emotions like a sponge, often erroneously taking
the blame or responsibility for them. Even if a parent falls ill and
passes away, it can seem like abandonment or something you made happen
if you’re too young to understand death.

IT CAN BE PHYSICAL . . .

Most people understand that it’s not okay to physically harm or even
spank a child. But here’s an example that’s not as obvious: Any invasive
medical procedure—even something as commonplace as a circumcision or
getting stiches—may register the exact same as physical abuse if you
experience it in your first few years of life. You may even start to
distrust your caregivers for bringing you to an unfamiliar place and not
keeping you safe.

OFTEN IT’S INTELLECTUAL . . .

After the first few years of life, you start to separate from your
parents. In this period, it’s their job to help you become your own
person and confidently stand on your own two feet in the world. Here, a
whole new set of problems can arise—especially when parents try to
over-control you, habitually criticize you, or unreasonably expect you
to be perfect. Other families adhere to such rigid rules that any
manifestation of a child’s individuality is immediately attacked as a
threat. All these can lead to esteem problems later in life.

OR IT CAN TAKE OVER YOUR ENTIRE IDENTITY . . .

Within a dysfunctional family system, each child tends to play a
different role that helps the family survive and detracts from its real
issues. These can include the revered _hero_, the troublemaking
_scapegoat_, the neglected _lost child_, the people-pleasing _placater_,
and the mood-lifting _mascot_. Later in life, these roles (as well as
birth order) can lead to corresponding personality issues, whether it’s
the hero’s judgmental perfectionism, the scapegoat’s explosive anger,
the lost child’s low self-esteem, the placater’s denial of personal
needs, or the mascot’s impulsive irresponsibility.

BUT IT’S NOT EASY TO SEE YOUR OWN CORE ISSUES . . .

Your oldest beliefs, behaviors, and adaptations have not just been
reinforced by decades of habit, but are built deep into the architecture
of your brain, which is busy building new neural connections at an
astounding rate in early life. As the saying goes, “Cells that fire
together, wire together.” So trying to see yourself with any objectivity
can be like trying to touch your right elbow with your right hand.

But if you can detach from yourself a little bit, you’ll notice that the
things you do and think don’t just come out of nowhere. Here are a few
techniques and tools you can use to better understand the way your past
can interfere with your happiness, your relationships, and your life
today.

YOU CAN WORK BACKWARD . . .

Are you relentlessly driving yourself to succeed and beating yourself up
when you fail? Maybe that’s because when you were a teenager, your
parents made you feel as if your worth as a human being was dependent on
your grades, touchdowns, or accomplishments.

Are you out of touch with your emotions because Stepdad always told you
to toughen up when you cried? Do you feel deep down like you don’t
matter because you were often ignored growing up? Are you always trying
to save or care for others because you were never able to save Mom from
her depression or addiction? Are you in complete denial that anything
was wrong with your family because Dad acted as if he were infallible
and must be unquestioningly obeyed, so criticizing him would be like
blaspheming God?

Are you getting the hang of this yet?

YOU CAN EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE . . .

Some of you have a big bag of shit you’re carrying around. And every
time you encounter a situation in which you can possibly get more shit
to put in the bag, you grab it and stuff it inside. You’ll even ignore
all the diamonds glittering nearby, because all you can see is the shit.

This shit is known as “the stories you tell yourself.”

Examples include generalizations like “I make bad decisions,” “If people
saw the real me, they wouldn’t like me,” or, conversely, “No one is good
enough for me.” Each of these beliefs can be formed in childhood by,
respectively, fault-finding parents, abandoning parents, and parents who
put you on a pedestal.

As a result, you can spend much of your life misinterpreting situations
and thinking you’ve found more evidence to support these false
conclusions formed in childhood. One way to recognize when you’re stuck
in your own story is whenever you feel less than or better than others.

YOU CAN EXAMINE THIS CHART . . .

  --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------
  WOUNDED CHILD         ADAPTED ADOLESCENT       FUNCTIONAL ADULT
  (EMOTIONALLY 0–5)     (EMOTIONALLY 6–18)       (EMOTIONALLY MATURE)

  --------------------- ------------------------ ------------------------

Then ask yourself: In a given week, do you exhibit any of the wounded
child or adolescent behaviors here? If so, you may have either gotten
stuck somewhere along the way in your emotional or behavioral
development, or certain situations are causing you to revert to those
ages.

Any time you overreact to something—by shutting down, losing your
temper, sulking, feeling hopeless, freaking out, disassociating, or any
of numerous other dysfunctional behaviors—it’s typically because an old
wound has been triggered. And you’re regressing to the childhood or
adolescent state that corresponds to that feeling.

Note that the wounded child tends to directly internalize the messages
that caretakers give; the adapted adolescent tends to react against
them.

HOWEVER, NOT EVERYONE REACTS TO THE SAME TRAUMA IN THE SAME WAY . . .

And children are born with different predispositions and resiliencies.

So if you remain loyal to people who abuse and mistreat you, that’s
called _trauma bonding_.

If you only feel normal if you’re doing something extreme or high-risk,
that’s _trauma arousal_.

If you’ve developed intense self-loathing, you’ve got _trauma shame_.

If you find chemical, mental, or technological ways to numb yourself and
your feelings, that’s _trauma blocking_.

And it goes on and on. One pattern of trauma; many different possible
responses to it. We’ve only scratched the surface. But at least you know
the model we’re working with here.

IT’S NOT ABOUT BLAMING BUT UNDERSTANDING . . .

In summary, we each spend our adult lives running on a unique operating
system that took some eighteen years to program and is full of distinct
bugs and viruses. And when we put together all these different theories
of attachment, developmental immaturity, post-traumatic stress, and
internal family systems, they make up a body of knowledge that allows us
to run a virus scan on ourselves and, at any point, to look at our
behaviors, our thoughts, and our feelings, and figure out where they
come from.

That’s the easy part. The tough part is to quarantine the virus, and to
recognize the false self and restore the true self. Because it isn’t
until we start developing an honest, compassionate, and functional
relationship with ourselves that we can begin to experience a healthy,
loving relationship with others.

“And that,” Lorraine concludes, “is what chair work is all about.”

At the Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous meeting that night, Carrie plops
down on the sofa next to me, her bare arm resting gently against mine. I
move my arm away. This is the new me.

“I can’t believe that bitch still won’t let you talk to me,” she says.

“It’s for your own safety. I’m too dangerous for women.”

Charles, who’s sitting across from me, makes a slashing motion over his
neck. He’s right. Even that little is too much. I leave the room, return
a few moments later, and sit somewhere else. Although it seems like a
sensible thing to do and respectful of Ingrid, this kind of distant,
uninterested behavior is probably only going to make Carrie like me
more. This is, until she hears my check-in.

“I broke my contract Sunday morning,” I confess when my turn comes. “I
feel weird saying this in front of everyone, but I masturbated. I just
woke up in a certain condition and couldn’t help myself.”

The words ring in my head: “I couldn’t help myself.” That sounds exactly
like something an addict would say. To reassure myself, I ask if anyone
else has masturbated.

There’s total silence and then one hand sheepishly rises. “I have,”
Calvin whispers.

Suddenly, I’m the most out-of-control sex addict in the room. Calvin was
probably masturbating about his picnic. “I realized afterward,” I
continue, “that I was masturbating because I was terrified of my
girlfriend coming to visit. However, it turned out to be incredible
having her here, and it made me want to take my recovery more seriously
and become a better person.”

As we walk out of the lounge after the meeting, Charles falls into step
with me. “Let me give you some advice so you don’t break your contract
again,” he says. “Believe, behave, become: Believe in you and Ingrid.
Behave for Ingrid. Become a nuclear family.”

It’s good advice. The three steps.

“If you ever decide to admit you’re powerless over your addiction, you
can look me up in L.A. when you leave,” he continues magnanimously. “I
can get you into a private therapy group with one of the best CSATs in
L.A.”

Evidently I said the right thing in today’s meeting. I decide to ask him
how he relapsed, since he shared the details of his story with the group
before I arrived. “I was in New Zealand, where prostitution is legal,”
he answers. His voice is melancholy, yet despite himself, a guilty smile
creeps across his face. Joan calls this _euphoric recall_. “And I ended
up going to this place where they had a menu of services and had a
threesome with two very attractive women for four hundred and fifty
dollars.”

We stand silently at the edge of the dormitory for a moment, both
dialing up the visual, a crack of desire appearing in Charles’s
austerity. “And that was bad,” I say. “Very bad.”

“Yeah, very bad.”

That night, I dream that Ingrid and I are in a hotel room in Las Vegas
with a priest we’re paying by the hour.

“I now pronounce you man and wife,” the priest says.

As soon as the words leave his lips, a cold shroud of fear envelops me.
Something irreversible has taken place in just seconds and I’m overcome
with regret because I know I can’t reciprocate what Ingrid feels. I wake
up with a sense of doom hanging over my head.

Charles’s words ring in my head: “Become a nuclear family.”

What’s so great about a nuclear family? I wonder, before I can stop
myself. All the word _nuclear_ makes me feel is a fear of annihilation.

Chicago, Twenty-Three Years Earlier

_Ring. Ring._

Hello.

Is Todd there?

_It’s a girl calling for my younger brother. They always call for him.
Never for me._

No, he’s out.

This is Rachel.

Hey.

I’m with Julia and we were calling to invite him over. We’re having a
special party. Julia, why don’t you tell him about it?

_They both giggle. It’s a sound only teenage girls can make. It is their
mating call._

Yeah, Jonas and Craig were over, but they can’t get it up anymore.

What do you mean? What are you guys doing?

We’re really horny. Want to come over?

_This is it: finally, a chance to lose my virginity. And I need to
become a man before college._

_There’s only one problem._

I can’t. I’m grounded.

We’ll make it worth your while.

How?

We’ll give you—_and here she whispers_—a blow job.

Together?

If you want. We’ll do you so right if you do us right.

God, I want to come over so much.

_I can’t believe they’re offering to have a threesome with me. This
would be the Super Bowl of teenage sexual experiences. But I stayed out
too late one night without calling my mom, so I got grounded for two
months. I’ve spent most of my teenage life punished. The year before, my
mom somehow found out that I’d gone to a rock concert I wasn’t allowed
to attend, so she grounded me for six months._

Hurry. Julia wants to have sex with you.

Really?

She wants you, Neil.

Fuck, I want her too. But I don’t think I can today.

_Or any day for the next seven weeks._

Why not?

I told you. I’m grounded.

Just sneak out.

I can’t. I don’t have the keys to the house.

You’re no fun.

Wait.

Let’s call Alex. Hey, do you have Alex’s number?

_Looking back on that phone call—the only time I ever got propositioned
in high school or college—I don’t know why I never rebelled, why I never
just went out anyway, why even at that age I put up with being
constantly imprisoned. Senior year of high school, second semester, when
you’ve already been accepted to college—that’s supposed to be the best
time of your life. At least for teenagers who aren’t enmeshed._

Lorraine tapes several sheets of butcher paper across the wall and asks
me about my relatives as far back as my great-grandfather. As I speak,
she maps my family tree, diagramming everything I know about each
relative, from their birth order to tragedies in their lives to the
power balance in their marriages. This is called a genogram. She’s
looking for patterns. And she finds several.

“I’ve been doing this a long time, and this is one of the most
narcissistic mothers I’ve ever come across,” she tells me when we get to
my parents and my relationship history. “She suffocated you, so you set
up a wall with her that you kept in place through anger and sneaking
around behind her back. And you’re still using that wall to keep from
being suffocated by Ingrid.”

Everything she says lands in my head like the sweep of a broom, knocking
away cobwebs and uncovering lost brain cells, like the years of anger
and regret I harbored over being grounded and missing out on my only
high school sexual opportunity.

“There’s one thing that’s been bothering me,” I tell Lorraine. “I can’t
understand why I never stood up for myself against her strictness and
just rebelled or ran away?”

She looks at my genogram for a moment, then responds: “Because your
example was your dad, and he never stood up for himself. And his father
didn’t stand up to his mother either.”

The rest of the guys nod in agreement as I wonder whether my grandfather
had a secret sex life too. Probably. “And you’ll notice,” she continues,
“that they didn’t model a healthy relationship for you. It’s no wonder
you have fear when it comes to Ingrid. You don’t want to end up in a
relationship like the one your parents have.”

Growing up, I often wished my parents would have affairs. When my mother
and I found photos of my father out with a woman we didn’t recognize, I
was happy he’d apparently found some romance and excitement outside his
desolate marriage. It’s no wonder cheating came so naturally to me. I’d
given myself permission long before I’d ever had a girlfriend.

Lorraine spends the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon doing
everyone’s genograms. When she finishes, she tells us that before we
start our chair work tomorrow, she wants to teach us about the
relationship between the love addict and the love avoidant—or, as she
prefers to put it, the codependent and the counterdependent.

“If you think of intimacy as _into me I see and I share that with
you_—that’s intimacy,” Lorraine begins.

I’ve heard the word _intimacy_ constantly here, spoken as if it’s the
holy grail. And all these fun things—from sex to drugs to ambition to
even dressing attractively, reading novels, or having intellectual
thoughts—are supposed to be eliminated because they’re barriers to it.

“Intimacy problems come from a lack of self-love,” she continues.
“Someone who fears intimacy thinks, unconsciously, If you knew who I
actually was, you’d leave me.”

“I always think that!” Calvin says, raising his hand for a high five. It
goes unslapped.

“I’d classify all of you as intimacy avoidants,” she presses on. “The
avoidant is very good at seducing, in the sense that he has an uncanny
ability to find out what his partner needs and give it to her. Because
he was usually enmeshed, he gets his worth and value from taking care of
needy people.”

“So are guys love avoidants and women love addicts?” Calvin asks.

“No, I’ve seen both. What happens in either case is that we choose
partners who are at our age of emotional development and maturity, and
whose issues are complementary to ours. Your wives may think they sent
you here because you’re sick and they’re normal, but I’ve never worked
with a couple where one of them had it all together and the other was a
screw-up. They’ve got just as many issues as you do. Proof of this is
the fact that they’re still with you.”

“Can I please get you on the phone with my wife to tell her that?” Adam
asks.

“This is exactly what I’m talking about,” Lorraine responds. “That’s the
enmeshed child in you speaking. You should be in recovery for you, not
for her. And that’s typical of your marriage as a whole. Because when a
love avoidant and a love addict begin a relationship, a predictable
pattern occurs: The avoidant gives and gives, sacrificing his own needs,
but it’s never enough for the love addict. So the avoidant grows
resentful and seeks an outlet outside of the relationship, but at the
same time feels too guilty to stop taking care of the needy person.”

“By outlet, you mean an affair?” Adam interrupts.

“It can be,” Lorraine says. “But it can also be obsessive exercising or
work or drugs or living on the edge or anything high-risk. He will also
compartmentalize it because the secrecy helps kick that intensity up a
notch. In the meantime, as the avoidant’s walls keep getting higher, the
love addict uses denial to hold on to the fantasy and starts accepting
unacceptable behavior.”

As she speaks, I think of one of the most classic myths of our
civilization: _The Odyssey_. Odysseus cheats rampantly on his voyage
home from the Trojan War, even shacking up with a nymph for seven years,
knowing full well that his wife, Penelope, is waiting for him.
Meanwhile, Penelope stays pure for twenty years, even though she thinks
he’s dead. Yet Odysseus is the hero of the tale and even slaughters all
108 of Penelope’s suitors for daring to court her. In here, they’d
diagnose Odysseus as a love avoidant—off adventuring, warring, and
intensity-seeking—and Penelope as a love addict, living in fantasy. This
relationship is as old as time.

“But the avoidant’s behavior has consequences,” Lorraine continues, “and
chief among them is something most of you are familiar with: getting
caught. And that shatters the fantasy for the love addict, who
experiences her biggest nightmare: abandonment, which replicates her
original wound.”

One thing Odysseus did right is that he didn’t get caught. That’s
because they didn’t have paparazzi, social media, mobile phones, and the
Internet back then. It was easier to compartmentalize.

“The pain and the fear are so intense for the love addict that she often
develops her own secret life as well. Where the avoidant wants the
highs, the addict typically goes for the lows. She wants
benzodiazepines, alcohol, romance novels, shopping till she drops, or
anything that depresses the central nervous system. If she acts out
sexually or has an emotional affair, it’s not for intensity, but to numb
the pain and get away from the agonizing hurt. Soon, the relationship is
no longer about love for either partner, but about escaping from
reality.”

Lorraine draws a diagram of the unhealthy relationship she’s been
describing:

[image]

“Is everybody one or the other?” Calvin asks. “I feel like I’m both.”

It’s a good question: I’ve always seen myself as more ambivalent in my
relationships than avoidant, but perhaps doubt is just a form of
avoidance because it prevents me from ever fully committing to anyone.

“Some people have elements of both or play different roles at different
times,” Lorraine responds. She then draws a picture of a healthy
relationship:

[image]

“A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a
relationship and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the
relationship and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly
dependent or independent: They are interdependent, which means that they
take care of the majority of their needs and wants on their own, but
when they can’t, they’re not afraid to ask their partner for help.” She
pauses to let it all sink in, then concludes, “Only when our love for
someone exceeds our need for them do we have a shot at a genuine
relationship together.”

“Can I ask a question?” I blurt. For some reason, whenever someone
starts telling me what’s right and wrong, or making life sound so
black-and-white, I get uneasy. My fellow red demons give one another a
look. They know where this usually leads. I walk up to the blackboard as
Calvin rubs his hands together gleefully.

In her model of an unhealthy relationship, I erase the arrows and the
words _neediness_ and _resentment_. Then I erase the other person, until
all that remains is one person in a box with an excitement arrow:

“If we eliminate one half of the dysfunctional relationship, the
dysfunction is gone,” I explain. “What’s left is a single guy enjoying
life and its pleasures. Why is the option with two people in a
reciprocal nurturing relationship any better than this option?”

“If it’s not outside your value system and there aren’t any negative
consequences, then live it up,” Lorraine replies. “But I would question
why you’d choose intensity over intimacy.”

“Because intensity’s more fun.”

This time, I return Calvin’s high five as I take my seat. I’m not doing
a very good job of taking my recovery more seriously, but in her
depiction of a relationship, all the highs and peak experiences of life
have to be sacrificed in the name of intimacy. And that doesn’t seem
like a goal worth aspiring to.

“I’d be willing to bet that after the high of the intensity, there’s a
comedown, and you feel not so great and you need that next hit of
intensity,” Lorraine responds coolly. “So ultimately, you can live your
life like a hamster on a wheel, chasing after the next hit to keep
yourself spinning. Or you can realize that ultimately it’s all a
distraction to avoid the harsh reality that you are not connected to
yourself.”

The jubilation in the room dies down. Her blows are well aimed and hard.
Unlike Joan, Lorraine doesn’t seem to be trying to win, but rather to
help—and her position is not only less dogmatic, it actually makes
sense.

“There’s an unconscious part of ourselves we want to defend,” she
continues, “and it’s been useful and helped us survive the difficult
stuff we went through with Mom or Dad or the priest or the coach. But we
don’t want it driving the car anymore.” She looks at me and Troy and
Adam and Calvin, then concludes: “Life’s not worth living if you’re
living someone else’s life.”

Calvin starts crying.

Today I saw myself. For perhaps the first time in my life.

The day after Lorraine’s lecture, we walk into the treatment room to
find six chairs carefully arranged. There are two chairs near one wall.
The first is for Lorraine, the second for her first victim—which I soon
find out is me. There’s a third empty chair facing mine on the other
side of the room. The seats for the rest of my libidinous brethren are
lined up against the wall on my left side, as if out of the range of
fire.

Each chair has a box of Kleenex next to it.

“You’re going to want to imagine that you have wetsuits on,” Lorraine
tells the rest of the guys. “And zip them up tight, because it’s going
to get very emotional in here and I don’t want any of you affected.”

I brace myself for what’s to come as she tells me, “Before we start this
process, I’d like you to know that there are married men who are not
only faithful, but don’t even think of cheating.”

Before the adapted adolescent in me can respond with something cynical
like, “And there are also men born with eleven toes,” she tells me to
close my eyes and shut off my thoughts. “Pay attention to the feeling of
your feet on the ground and the gentle in and out of your breathing,”
she says, her voice slowing and softening. “Notice how every time you
exhale, you become more relaxed.”

I know what she’s doing: She is putting me into a trance. And I trust
her, so I try to relax and let go. She asks me to imagine my
eight-year-old self sitting next to me, watching the events that are
about to unfold. As I try to visualize that skinny, awkward kid with the
cheap glasses, I recall Joan saying that fantasizing is a defense
against intimacy. So I wonder what she’d have to say about this.

Shit, I need to stop thinking critically for this to work.

Focus on breathing, come back to the moment.

There.

“I want you to imagine that your dad is outside the door. Picture him as
he looked when you were growing up.”

I summon an image of my father: He is bald, wearing a faded blue
monogrammed dress shirt tucked into black pants. There’s a gentleness to
his face, but also a distant look, as if he’s not completely present. In
short, I see him exactly as he was when I was eight.

“Call him into the room and ask him to sit down in the chair across from
you.”

I do as she says and try to imagine my father walking into the room.
It’s eerie how easy it is to feel like I can see him. The imagination is
a powerful thing. Of course, I’ve had plenty of practice with it, but it
usually involves that threesome I missed out on.

“What’s he doing?” she asks.

“He’s just sitting there, kind of disconnected.”

“I’d like you to talk to him. Repeat what I say: _Today I am calling you
into this room and holding you accountable for the way you raised me_.”
She speaks the words loudly and forcefully—as if she is the parent and
my father the child, as if she is the judge and he the accused. I try to
match her tone, repeat her words, and not sound too ridiculous in front
of my fellow addicts in their imaginary wetsuits.

_“This is not about you, Dad,”_ she says. _“This is about me.”_

I repeat.

_“This is about your behaviors, not about who you are as a person.”_

I repeat, and she urges me: “Louder! Really speak up and tell him off.”
She shifts into her accusatory voice. _“You were never there for me,
Dad. When Mom punished me, you chose to stay silent, even though you
knew her punishments were arbitrary and unfair.”_

I try to own each phrase, to feel it as deeply as I can, to release it
as explosively as possible. And it goes on:

_“You never protected me.”_

_“You neglected me.”_

_“I’m not going to act out for you anymore, Dad.”_

_“I’m not going to medicate anymore by seducing women.”_

I throw the words with force at my dad, but as I do, a voice in my head
goes, “Wait a minute. I worked hard to learn how to seduce women!”

She’s still feeding me: _“I’m not going to medicate anymore with cheap
sex in some club bathroom.”_

I repeat, but the voice in my head grows louder. “Hey, those are among
my most treasured life experiences. What is she implanting in me while
I’m in a trance?” Then another voice reminds me, “Go with it. That’s why
you’re here.” So many voices. Joan can add dissociative identity
disorder to my file now.

And the tirade continues:

_“I’m angry.”_

“Shout it: _‘I’m angry!’_” I try, but it’s not enough for her. She has
me scream it over and over until I’m really summoning wrath and hurling
it at him.

“Tell your father what it was like being punished by him!”

I do as she instructs: “The only time you ever punished me was when you
spanked me because I made you late to watch a TV show. I was only a kid
and I was having fun on the walk home. You didn’t punish me to make me a
better person. It proved everything Mom said about you being selfish.”

_“That was wrong, Dad!”_ she has me repeat. My eyes well with tears,
with the sadness that I never allowed myself to show at the time. She’s
getting to me. _“You were shameless! And I give you back your shame!”_

As I tell him off for not being a father, for being checked out, for
never standing up for me, I hear Calvin sobbing in the background.
Evidently he didn’t zip his wetsuit up high enough. As for me, I have no
wetsuit. I’m in the moment, yelling at my father, flushing out the
loneliness and sadness of childhood. It’s as if a heavy load is lifting
off me.

“You had a secret life, Dad,” I’m telling him now. “You lied to all of
us and it wasn’t fair. You disappeared on Thursdays, and no one knew
where you were or what you were doing. You traded photos with a group of
guys who shared your obsession. You kept it in the closet and it was
more important to you than any of us.”

“Let go,” she encourages me. “Tell him how shameless it was for him to
teach you to lie and sneak and hide things.”

The next word doesn’t make it out of my throat. All that emerges is a
sudden, uncontrollable sobbing. I can’t remember the last time I cried
this much.

“What just happened?” she asks.

“I realized why he has that obsession,” I say, each word escaping after
a heave of my chest. “Because that’s how he feels inside, like a
cripple. He’s emotionally crippled.”

And then I really break down.

When I recover, she tells me to return his problems, behaviors,
emotions, and neglect to him so that I can shrink my shame core. She
asks how he’s receiving all this, and when I respond that he’s taken it
in as best he can, she has me tell him to leave the room.

“Now I’d like you to imagine your mother standing outside the door,” she
says.

Anxiety bursts from my chest and buzzes through every nerve in my body
like a swarm of insects. This is the moment I’ve been dreading.

31

It’s much more difficult to imagine my mother outside, because just a
few days ago she refused to come here. So I know she’d never walk into a
room full of strangers to air personal problems.

“Order her in, then,” Lorraine instructs. “Tell her she has no choice.”

I do as she says and eventually I see my mom limp into the room.

“What’s she doing?”

“She’s sitting down and she has a sort of joyful, happy face on. But
it’s just a mask.”

“Can we see through it?”

“It’s pretty convincing.”

“Let’s see how it holds up. Tell her she told you things she shouldn’t
tell a kid.”

I do as she instructs, but for some reason, it doesn’t sound very
assertive.

_“You made me your surrogate spouse,”_ she cues me.

I repeat her words and try to match her tone, but it rings hollow.

_“You enmeshed me, Mom.”_

I can’t seem to find the inner strength and conviction to yell at her
about all this. Besides, she doesn’t know what enmeshment means. I
didn’t even know myself until a week ago.

_“You committed emotional incest.”_

This is where I draw the line. “I can’t say incest. Can I call it
emotional abuse?”

“That’s fine. But is anything else wrong?”

“Yeah, as I’m saying these things, I’m hearing her voice in my head
telling me, ‘I did my best to raise you. And I talked to you because I
had no one else to turn to.’”

“Are those things true?” Lorraine asks.

“They are to her.”

“Are they to you?”

“No.”

“Then tell her what it was like growing up with her. If it’s easier for
you, simply list the things she did.”

I suck in air and prepare myself. Ever since I presented my timeline,
the thread holding together the first eighteen years of my life has been
completely ripped apart, with strands swirling through my memory, trying
to coalesce around the new narrative that Joan and Lorraine see so
clearly. So I just let it all out.

The room, and the world, seem to freeze as I vomit out every single
memory of being overcontrolled, overwhelmed, and overshared with: The
constant groundings. The warnings that everyone was out to hurt me. The
criticisms of all my friends and girlfriends. The belittling of my dad
as a husband and lover. The prohibiting of my first dates. The
withholding of keys to the house. The insistence that I report to her
room after returning home at night to tell her everything I did. The
abandonment when I chose to live with a girlfriend. The request to not
bring girlfriends when I visited home. The refusal to let them stay at
the house when I did. The comments that she’d rather live to see my next
book than to see a grandchild. The constant admonishments that I don’t
take care of things and I lose everything and I can’t be trusted and on
and on and fucking on.

I pause. “There’s more, but that seems like enough for now.”

“Tell her what you think of all that,” Lorraine says.

The narrative is disturbingly clear. “I didn’t want to believe the
counselors here at first, Mom, because it’s so weird, but you’ve been
trying to keep me all to yourself. And since you can’t do it physically
anymore, you continue to do it emotionally. Why?”

“Do you want to know why?” Lorraine asks.

“Please.”

“She wants a monogamous relationship with you. So when you’re in a
relationship with someone else, you’re being unfaithful to her. And if
you don’t take your emotional life back, you’ll be in a relationship
with your mother until the day you die.”

She has me yell at her, _“Shame on you, Mom, for scaring away women so
you could have me to yourself!”_

Despite all I’ve learned, I still feel guilty for hurting my mom this
way and for bursting her bubble. But Lorraine keeps encouraging me to
defeat my resistance with volume, until I’m roaring her words: _“_This
is your pain I’ve been carrying, Mom! I’m giving your pain back to you.”
My voice fills the room until it feels like there’s no space for air.
“I’m very angry. And I have a right to be angry!”

“Tell her how it felt when she told you never to make anyone as
miserable as your father makes her.”

“It fucked me up, Mom. It made me avoid relationships and made me fear
the future. It made me scared that I would make someone I loved
miserable, that I was bad for them, that we’d end up hating each other
like you and Dad.”

And all of a sudden I collapse into tears. Fuck.

“What are you feeling?” Lorraine asks.

“I haven’t been connecting with Ingrid.” The tears come harder. I can’t
believe I’m bawling like this. Again. “Every time I have sex with her,
I’m thinking about some random woman I didn’t have sex with. I’m not
letting her in.” I’m crumpled in my seat now. I can hear Calvin and the
other guys crying. I feel the support and encouragement of all the sex
maniacs in the room. “It’s not fair to her.”

“Do you know why that is?”

“No.”

“Because your mother has taught you to fear women. So you avoid intimacy
by not being present and connected when you’re with Ingrid.”

Before I can process that concept, she has me yelling, _“I’m not letting
you scare me away from women anymore, Mom. I’m going to love who I want,
and you can find someone else to be your confidant.”_

It’s preposterous, but I really feel like my mom’s sitting there and I’m
telling her all these things. Tears pour down my face. Until this
moment, I’d maintained a small reserve of skepticism about the concept
of emotional incest. But now there’s no doubt. I feel the truth of it in
every cell of my body. _“I’m not going to be afraid of intimacy for you
anymore, Mom!”_

And when it seems like everything’s come out, that there are no more
tears and snot left inside, Lorraine asks if I have anything else to
tell my mother.

“Yes.” I take a deep breath and let the last thing out: “I’m not keeping
your secrets for you anymore, Mom.” And fuck if I don’t break down
again.

Lorraine asks what I’m experiencing. I tell her, “I realize that she
feels on the outside how Dad feels on the inside: like she’s deformed.”
And then I have a fucking breakdown within the breakdown. I don’t share
this next epiphany, but I recognize that they do belong together: two
trauma-bonded cripples who are comfortable in their walls of secrecy and
silent suffering, who are even more afraid of intimacy than I am, and
who are mortally terrified of anyone knowing who they are.

It turns out it wasn’t me who was the black sheep. That blackness came
from them. That’s how they feel on the inside, underneath the mask.

I thought that the tears were done and dried, but they’re back again.
This time, though, they’re accompanied by a feeling of lightness and
freedom in my chest. I can’t remember the last time I saw the truth.
This is more cathartic than any drug experience I’ve ever had. All my
anxiety and fear and guilt have peeled away, as if they were layers of
clothing I didn’t know I was wearing. I thought they were part of my
skin the whole time, but it turns out they were someone else’s
hand-me-downs.

So that’s what they mean by my false self.

I used to think that intelligence came from books and knowledge and
rational thought. But that’s not intelligence: It’s just information and
interpretation. Real intelligence is when your mind and your heart
connect. That’s when you see the truth so clearly and unmistakably that
you don’t have to think about it. In fact, all thinking will do is lead
you away from the truth and soon you’ll be back in your head, groping
with a penlight in the dark again.

“How’s your mother feeling right now?” Lorraine asks.

“It got through to her. Her walls are crumbling and she’s realizing she
wasn’t actually a good mother after all.” Somehow I feel set free by the
thought that I was heard and understood. To the brain, the difference
between reality and imagination can be minor. After all, the information
travels down similar neural pathways. So I suppose it doesn’t matter
that she actually didn’t hear a thing and may never understand. My brain
thinks she did, and that’s good enough.

Lorraine directs me to send my mother out of the room, then has me tell
my eight-year-old self, who’s been sitting next to me and watching the
whole time, that I’m firing his parents—and that from now on I’m taking
care of him. She guides me through a visualization in which I imagine
shrinking him until he can fit in the palm of my hand and placing him in
my heart.

“Now that you’ve re-parented your inner child, you’re going to protect
him and look after him—and let him play with Ingrid’s inner child,”
Lorraine instructs. She gives me a few moments to imagine this, then
gently says, “You can open your eyes when you’re ready.”

There’s one thing I’ve been striving for all my life: with sex, with
writing, with surfing, with partying, with anything and everything. And
that is to be free. It’s the one feeling I never had growing up.

When I open my eyes, I feel free like I never have before. I see the
guys sitting against the wall, their cheeks shining with tears, and I
can tell they’ve been on this ride with me. Then I see Lorraine, beaming
at me like an angel. And I tell her, “You’re doing God’s work.”

The words come out of my mouth before I have a chance to think about
them. I’ve never used the word _God_ in my life in a spiritual context.
In fact, the week before, I even had an hour-long debate with the
spiritual counselor here, trying to dissuade him from the belief that
there’s a higher power who cares about the fate of every individual.

I once wanted to write a novel called _The Big Book of Negativity_. It
would be about what life is really like, the cold hard truth. But in
this moment, I’m so full of light, hope, and positivity that I wouldn’t
be able to put a single word on paper. I can’t even connect to the idea
anymore.

I need to hold on to the golden cord that, right now, is connecting my
brain to my heart and illuminating the path to my authentic self—or, as
the singer and poet Patti Smith once put it, “the clean human being that
I was as a child.”

“You look like you’re floating on a foot of air,” Calvin tells me.

Technically, this process is called post-induction therapy. Others call
it ego-state integration. Joan calls it feeling reduction work. And
Lorraine calls it an experiential. But those are euphemisms for what it
really is: an exorcism. An exorcism of childhood demons.

“You’ve been letting the grounded teenager control your life,” Lorraine
says as I rise unsteadily to my feet. “And he wants to compensate for
missing out on his adolescence by doing all the things and having all
the women he was never allowed. But it’s time to be an adult.” She hands
me a box of Kleenex. “It will wear you out if you don’t live your
authentic life.”

I excuse myself from the room to get some fresh air. As I stand outside,
experiencing the warmth of the sun and the cool of the wind and the
smell of the trees through reopened senses, I think, I can’t wait to
connect with Ingrid. To look into her eyes and let her see into me—all
the way—and not be afraid of what she might find there.

_T_he problem with time is that it doesn’t go backward.

Every word, every step, every action is irreversible. If we step in
front of a moving car, if we sign a contract we haven’t read, if we
betray the person we love, the best we can do is try to clean up the
mess. But no matter how hard we scrub, the stain on reality will never
come out. The word you just read can never be unread.

And so I am back in the airport where I stood fifteen days earlier, on
the way to the plane that will take me back to Ingrid, blinking in the
light of a reality that is no longer the same.

Instead of glimpsing anonymous individuals hurrying by, I see different
archetypal products of bad parenting. That meek old man with the blank
stare was probably beaten senseless by his father; the sad-looking obese
guy in an undersized T-shirt may have grown up with a mom who expressed
love only through her cooking; the uptight businessman was likely raised
by strict parents who never allowed him to be imperfect. Suddenly there
seem to be very few adults in the world, just suffering children and
overcompensating adolescents.

When I see a tempting mane of blond or black hair, I try not to turn my
head and “pornify” this human being or see her as “a collection of body
parts.”

If the discharge papers in my luggage are to be believed, I am a very
sick man.

According to my psychiatric evaluation, I have “Axis I sexual disorder,
generalized anxiety syndrome, and depressive disorder,” in addition to
“problems with primary support group” and “problems related to social
environment.” As the coup de grâce, I have an Axis V rating of fifty out
of a hundred—a score reserved for head cases who are either suicidal or
so functionally impaired they’re unable to form basic friendships. This
diagnosis is followed by a three-page list of medications and treatments
I’d supposedly been given in rehab, including an enema, none of which
I’d taken or even requested.

I wonder for a moment if my mother was right. These medical opinions,
most of them made up by someone who clearly has her own psychological
issues, are now on my permanent record, where they could come back to
haunt me at any time. I start to imagine going through a divorce trial
in the future and a lawyer showing this evaluation to the judge as
evidence that I shouldn’t have custody of my children.

I have left rehab AMA—against medical advice. There was no reason to
stay. After the chair work with Lorraine, we were back with Joan for
family week. Since my parents weren’t coming, and Joan said it wasn’t
necessary for Ingrid to return, and even Charles admitted that the final
week mostly involved administrators trying to up-sell the hospital’s
aftercare program, there didn’t seem to be much point in spending the
money to stick around. The other guys who didn’t have families to
save—Calvin and Paul—said they were planning to break out early as well.

Before leaving, I stopped by Lorraine’s office to get her contact
information in case I needed to get in touch with her in an emergency.
She gave me an hour of good advice on reentry into my relationship,
explaining, most importantly, that in order to be emotionally free to
commit to Ingrid, I need to limit contact with my mother. “Stick to
news, sports, and weather,” she advised with a smile.

Then I said goodbye to Joan, whose only words as she closed my file were
a dismissive “good luck.”

As I board the plane, I’m excited to use what I’ve learned about myself
to heal my relationship with Ingrid and earn back her trust. However, as
I’m buckling my seat belt, I see body parts: a pair of tan legs, long
and toned, topped by tight cutoff denim shorts. I look up to see a
frayed, loose-fitting gray sweater that, despite its bagginess, reveals
the outline of what are clearly large breasts. The body part above them
has flowing brown hair and a golden-hued face with very little makeup.
The sum effect of all these parts is so naturally sexual that even a
clown suit couldn’t hide it.

I try to put myself back in the chair with Lorraine and imagine my inner
child playing with Ingrid’s. But it’s too late. Out here, there’s just
too much reality: lights, colors, screens, signs, faces, fast food
wrappers, yoga pants. My brain is working so hard just to keep up, it
doesn’t have time to pause and think about consequences. And now this
woman has gotten in. I’m already imagining making out with her and
putting my hand up her sweater. This is covert sexualized violence. I
need to stop myself.

And so I think, Bright red apple, wrong orchard—and I look away. Damn
you, Charles, that was actually decent advice.

I notice another side effect of rehab: I am no longer _attracted_ to or
_turned on_ by random women; instead, I am _triggered_ by them. It’s the
same thing, but being attracted is a natural human impulse; being
triggered is an unhealthy plunge into the addiction cycle, into
compulsive behavior, into the charts and diagrams hanging in Joan’s
office.

This may be the first step in my downward spiral. And I haven’t even
been free for three hours.

2

In the baggage claim of LAX, I see her. She’s wearing an outfit that
would have gotten her banned from rehab: tank top with no bra and tight
jeans, with a wave of blond hair falling over the left side of her face.
At first, she backs away a step—maybe out of shyness, maybe fear. Then
joy washes over her face, as if a spotlight’s been turned on overhead,
and she rushes toward me.

“I’m ready to start something new with you,” she whispers. The warmth of
her breath fills my ear, carrying with it the implicit expectation that
I’ve been cured.

“Me too,” I reply. And I hope, for both our sakes, that I have changed.

We drive along the Pacific Coast Highway listening to electronic dance
music and making up lyrics to each instrumental. The sun kaleidoscopes
off the ocean, which stretches endlessly to the left, the silhouette of
Catalina Island visible faintly in the distance like the promise of
something new and transitory.

Our destination: the two-bedroom guesthouse in Malibu that we used to
share. The day she found out I was cheating, Ingrid called two friends
to help her move out, and she’s been living with them since. Before
leaving, her friends grabbed a permanent black marker and defaced not
just the books I’d published, but cover samples for ones that weren’t
even out yet.

[image]

“I got you something special,” Ingrid says with a wide, toothy smile as
we walk inside. She pulls a small brass key out of her purse. “Everyone
deserves a second chance.”

“What’s that?”

“Your mom wouldn’t give you the keys to her house when you were in
rehab, so I’m giving you my key.”

“To what?”

“To my filing cabinet at work.”

“Why not your house?”

“I have to be out soon because my friend’s lease is ending.”

She takes a small metal chain, threads it through the key, and gently
fastens it around my neck like a charm for healing childhood wounds. No
one I’ve dated has ever done anything this meaningful for me.

“This key,” I tell her, “will serve as a reminder that I can be trusted
and that I can tell the truth.”

In bed that night, as I hold Ingrid against me and run my hands along
her skin, I try to let go completely, to breathe and stay in the moment,
to be open and vulnerable.

“Should we?” she asks.

“I don’t know. It’s up to you.”

“I don’t want you to break your contract.”

“Well, are we really not going to do it for ten more weeks?”

“I can try to wait.”

At this point, we’re naked and our bodies aren’t listening to us. As I
enter her, a rush of chemicals floods my brain and bathes my body. It
feels so relieving and uplifting, like I’m high, an alcoholic having his
first shot after rehab. But unlike before, I find it easier to stay with
Ingrid, remain connected, and look into her eyes and her being—to make
love and not just have sex.

It’s been a long time since I’ve seen and felt Ingrid this powerfully,
and so my love is fleeting. As soon as I release, my body dissolves into
weightless euphoria. I’m not sure if sex is an addiction or if it’s just
awesome.

When we shower together afterward, Ingrid starts making out with me. She
rubs me against her clit—which I believe would qualify, in Joan’s words,
as masturbating using my body. However, I’m not hard enough to have sex
with her again.

“I still haven’t come,” she pouts, trying to put it in. It’s only fair
that she also get off. So I look at her body and try to “pornify” her.
When this doesn’t work and I see Ingrid’s growing distress, I decide to
resort to more extreme measures: I think about the woman from the
airplane.

I’m doing this for Ingrid, I tell myself. And I imagine Short Shorts
sitting next to me on the plane, putting an airline blanket over us so
she can guide my hands to her smooth tan legs, whispering to meet in the
bathroom. It’s starting to work. I think about walking into the lavatory
and seeing her waiting for me, sitting on the toilet with her sweater
off and the button of her cutoff shorts undone, the fly unzipped just
enough to reveal her panties. She slides a hand under the waistband and
starts touching herself while looking me in the eye . . . and, god, now
I’m hard enough, now I can fuck Ingrid. I’m doing this for her. For her.

3

In the morning, I retrieve my phone from its resting place in my sock
drawer. I insert the battery, wait for it to come to life, and punch in
the password. A long parade of texts and emails rolls across the screen.

An Asian American tech entrepreneur, whom my friend Melanie once tried
to set me up with, writes that she wants to get on Skype to “distract
me.” An Australian girl I hooked up with on a book tour says she wants
to end six months of celibacy with me. A porn star I once had horrible
sex with in a bathroom says she misses me. A social-networking friend
from France whom I’ve never met asks when I’m going to be in Paris next,
and attaches a photo of herself standing naked in a garden. And on and
on: women sending sonar signals, waiting for a ping back so they know
what their position is.

The women you’ve slept with, the ones you never did but primed for a
future encounter, the ones who seemed interested but then suddenly
stopped texting: Unless you do something horribly wrong, they never
completely disappear. A lonely night, a cheating boyfriend, a sudden
breakup, an attack of low self-esteem, an attack of high
self-esteem—anything can, out of the blue, send them scrolling through
their address book looking for validation, for security, for
conversation, for adoration, for the fantasy of you filling some empty
space in their life.

Exacerbating this problem, I included my email address on a whim in one
of my early books, mostly because I didn’t think anyone would read it.
And so new temptation arrives to the inbox almost daily. The one that
stops me in my tracks today is from a woman named Raidne who says she’d
love to meet me. Unfortunately for my sobriety, she’s attached a photo.
She is of an ethnicity best described as Las Vegas: artificially
constructed to make every cell in the male visual brain throb with
desire—a blend of who-knows-what nationalities, beauty regimens, and
surgeries, resulting in a perpetual tan and fake breasts that catch the
light like brass Christmas ornaments.

I look at Ingrid’s key. And it looks back at me.

They say that a man is as faithful as his options, and in this moment I
know it to be true. So I switch the phone off. It’s too much. Even Jesus
had only three temptations.

Pets are the gateway drug to children. As a general rule, when a woman
over twenty-five gets a dog, it means she’s ready to start a family.

Nearly three weeks after my return, Ingrid and I are at the West Valley
Animal Shelter, where a diseased ball of black-and-white fur is
balancing on its hind legs and ever so gently resting its front paws on
Ingrid’s kneecap.

This one is good: He knows just how to win her heart. It doesn’t matter
that he’s got only one working eye, infected brown goo dripping out of
both ears, and a stench worse than a homeless person on a New York
subway. The deal is soon closed. This ten-pound runt, bred to be
faithful to whoever feeds him, has been saved.

Usually the pound keeps adopted dogs so they can get neutered before
being transferred to their new owner, but the receptionist just gives us
this one. She’s that eager to get rid of him. He has so many health
problems, she suggests getting everything else fixed before neutering
him.

On the way home, I check my post office box. Inside, amid the bills and
junk, there’s a square envelope addressed to me. I recognize the girly
handwriting on it as my mom’s.

I’m shocked when I open it to find this card:

Then I read the message inside:

[image]

Until recently, I used to think it was just her sense of humor when she
called herself long-suffering. Now I see that every joke comes with a
first-class ticket to a guilt trip. Clearly she’s not happy that I
abandoned my Sunday phone-call obligations after rehab.

It’s been a while since I’ve spoken to her, so when we return home, I
dutifully pick up the phone and dial her number. The conversation starts
casually enough, but soon the part that Lorraine warned me about begins.

“I’m worried about the things they told you in rehab,” she says. Her
voice is upbeat, as if about to break into song. “People come out of
psychotherapy thinking they have problems they don’t.” She seems to be
mounting a defense against whatever I’ve been learning, like a publicist
trying to spin-control a scandal.

“It’s actually been very helpful, and I’m smart enough to separate the
good from the bad.” I wish she were receptive enough to discuss what I
learned, but you can’t expect the same person who wounded you to heal
you. So I take a tip from my last conversation with Lorraine and
suggest: “Let’s talk about something else.”

“One thing first,” she says. “I want you to know that your father wasn’t
involved in your childhood. Marg”—the babysitter—“and I raised you. I
was home all the time for you unless I had to go out for something.” Her
voice is warm and suffocating, coming at me in a torrent of words I
can’t stop. My hands and wrists tighten, as if telling me that I need to
fight to save myself.

News. Sports. Weather.

“People always say how nice and sweet your father is. I think, if only
you knew that he’s just a piece of dirt. He does not have the ability to
love or care. It’s an act. I was on his computer the other day, and I
saw that he was searching for _congenital leg deformity_. He’s
terrible.”

“How’s the weather been in Chicago?” It feels like I’m struggling to get
a plastic bag off my head before I asphyxiate.

“You and your brother are the best things that have ever happened to
me,” she continues, talking right over the question as if she never
heard it. “I wasted my life, is what I really did. So if everything is
for nothing, then at least I have you two.”

I need to end this conversation. She may think she’s telling me how much
she loves me, but what I’m hearing is that by not calling her on
Sundays, I’m slowly killing her. One of the biggest indicators of
enmeshment, according to Lorraine, is when a mother tells her children
that she lives only for them.

“Hey, I gotta jump off the phone now.”

“Why?”

“I have a bunch of work to finish before the day ends.”

“And that’s more important than your mother?”

“Mom, I have to go, okay?!”

“Okay.” Her tone has changed. Now it’s sad, bruised, on the verge of
tears instead of laughter.

“Is everything all right, Mom?”

“Now I’m not going to be able to get to sleep tonight. You know how I—”
The guilt is like a carcinogenic gas, seeping through the holes of the
phone receiver, down my ear canal, and toward the folds and crevices of
my brain.

“Havetogonicetalkingbye!” I hang up the phone.

That was a close one. I can’t let her get back into my mind. I’ve got
enough problems in there as it is_._

I join Ingrid on the couch, where she’s sitting next to our used and
abused new shih tzu. I pet him and he barely reacts outside of blowing
snot from his nose, spraying my arm. Eventually he rises to his feet,
stretches out his front legs, takes a few steps, pisses on the couch,
walks in a tight pointless circle so that the urine gets all over his
paws, then drops back onto his chin, exhausted from this evidently
Herculean effort.

As I grab a roll of paper towels to clean the mess, I suggest calling
him Hercules. Ingrid stares rapturously at his black-and-white face. “I
love him,” she says. “I love Hercules.”

And I think: I can’t believe how easy it is for her to fall in love.

And then I think: Why is that not cheating?

And then I think: Now she’s going to neuter him.

For some reason, I’m disturbed hearing the word _love_ roll out of her
mouth so quickly and easily. Especially when I’ve been working so hard
to be worthy of it. Maybe love isn’t so sacred if we can attach it to
any furry thing with a heartbeat, bad breath, and no bladder control.

She scoops the dog up in her arms and trots to the bedroom to take a
nap. Now she’s sleeping with him. Is this still monogamy?

I grab my computer, find an image of the Mexican flag, and print it. I
have a small publishing imprint at HarperCollins, and decided recently
to contact two anonymous news bloggers in Mexico about writing a book on
the drug war there. Because the Mexican cartels have been trying to find
out who they are and execute them, however, the journalists want me to
verify my identity. So they asked me to email a photo of myself holding
a Mexican flag in one hand and a newspaper with today’s date in the
other. Lorraine would say this is a way to find intensity outside the
relationship without cheating. And perhaps she’s right.

As the flag image prints, I start thinking about our new shih tzu, which
makes me think of Asia, which makes me think of Asian women, which makes
me think of the tech entrepreneur who wanted to Skype me. I decide to
search the Internet to see how her start-up is doing, and I come across
a photo of her in a bikini. Five minutes later, I’m on PornHub watching
videos of Asian women who look like her while stroking myself.

I know I shouldn’t be doing this. It’s clearly compulsive. But it’s too
late to stop: That’s how compulsions work. Besides, I went to rehab for
cheating, not for porn. And I’m not breaking any promises to Ingrid.
There’s nothing wrong with jerking off occasionally. The whole notion
that I can only have an orgasm with Ingrid’s participation for the rest
of my life is ridiculous. I’ve been home and well behaved for almost a
month. I deserve this. I’m being interdependent.

I should send this image to the Mexican journalists.

A link underneath one of the clips leads me to an excessively pierced
girl with bleached-blond hair who looks like an emo version of Ingrid.
Suddenly I hear Ingrid’s sleepy voice summoning me: “Babe?”

I quickly zip up, close my browser, grab my computer, and walk into the
bedroom. But some combination of my flushed cheeks, overly innocent
expression, and the laptop in my hand gives me away.

“Were you watching porn?”

She’s not asking judgmentally, but I feel accused. I went to rehab to
stop cheating, and so far I’ve succeeded. I’ve been working on my
wandering eye, and that’s been going well. I’m successfully tapering off
my lust, one sin at a time. And today, these women are my sexual
methadone.

“Were you or weren’t you?”

This is my chance to be honest and intimate. If there’s nothing wrong
with watching porn, then I shouldn’t have any shame in telling Ingrid
about it. “Yes, I was. I thought you were sleeping and I didn’t want to
wake you.”

She rolls over, picks up Hercules from the floor, and hugs him against
her chest. I think she already loves that thing more than me.

And it looks like she’s enmeshing him.

“Did you finish?” she asks.

“No, I didn’t.”

And here it comes. The knife in the gut, spewing hot guilt all over my
insides: “You make love to those girls more than you make love to me!”

“That’s not true.” My heart clenches, my breathing gets shallow, and
what feels like hot steel rods coalesce lengthwise from my forearm to my
wrist. “This is the first time I’ve watched that stuff since I’ve been
back.”

She scoops up Hercules and walks out of the room. And I’m frustrated
because I shouldn’t have to defend myself if I want to have an orgasm
without her. Sometimes my inner child is going to want to play with
himself.

A text suddenly arrives on my phone from Belle, the Australian who wants
to end her celibacy experiment with me: “It’s my birthday today. I wish
you were unwrapping me right now.”

And I text back, “I wish I were too.”

Instantly, I’m filled with remorse. I don’t know why I just did that. Is
it because I’m feeling smothered by Ingrid? Is it because I would have
felt guilty letting Belle down on her birthday? Or is it because I need
more intensity in my life? Whatever the case, it was a stupid thing to
do. And if it isn’t technically cheating, it’s definitely a violation of
Ingrid’s trust in me.

Which would make it cheating.

Fuck.

I can’t believe how easy it was to slip up. That moment of blinding
clarity during my chair work with Lorraine already feels so far away,
like a memory of childhood innocence, and I wonder if it wasn’t actually
a cure but another high.

As I’m standing in the bedroom with my shame in my hand, Ingrid stomps
back in, stares at me for a moment with a hurt expression, and asks,
“What’s wrong with me? Am I ugly?”

“No, you’re not. You’re beautiful.” And she really is beautiful: The emo
girl I masturbated to had a body just like hers.

“Then why don’t you want to sleep with me?”

“I do. I was just procrastinating on my work, and I felt like I smelled
bad, and—I don’t know, I didn’t want to bother you.”

“You keep saying different things.”

“No, I don’t. They’re all true.”

I know she needs reassurance. She needs me to pick her up and sweep her
off her feet and make mad passionate reconnecting love to her. But right
now I can’t. I feel too guilty. I’m spiraling into my shame core like an
oil prospector who’s struck shit.

However, she does have a good point: Why would I rather masturbate to a
girl who looks like Ingrid than actually have sex with her in the flesh?
Is this intimacy avoidance or just normal male fantasizing?

And that’s when I realize why I was oversensitive to Ingrid’s affection
for Hercules, why I’m lusting after these women who aren’t one-tenth the
person Ingrid is, why I’m jeopardizing my relationship for a single
stupid text. It’s an unconscious reaction to my conversation with my
mother. I’m punching holes in the vacuum-sealed plastic bag of my
relationship so I don’t suffocate. The physiological reactions to
Ingrid’s complaints about me were almost the same ones I had to my mom’s
complaints about my father.

I drop onto the bed and explain this to Ingrid apologetically, along
with my fear of being trapped in a marriage like my parents’. Slowly she
begins to thaw, eventually sitting on the bed next to me and stroking my
head like I’m Hercules, a helpless creature to be pitied.

“Your problem is that you worry too much about the future,” she says,
her voice confident, her eyes wise, her hand tender. “You could die in a
car crash, or there could be an earthquake right now and the house could
collapse on top of us. There’s no guarantee we’ll be here tomorrow. So
let’s just love each other in this moment and appreciate each other in
this moment. We can deal with the future when we get there.”

She proposes taking a trip together when she can get time off work, some
place where we can enjoy peace, nature, and each other. “I’ve always
wanted to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu,” she suggests.

“Then let’s do it!”

She smiles, clasps the key hanging around my neck, and utters the most
beautiful words she’s spoken since before my infidelity ripped our world
apart: “I really trust you now. I don’t think you’d ever do anything to
hurt me.”

A wave of joy fills my heart, but it crashes instantly on the shore of
guilt. I just texted that Australian woman. If Ingrid saw my phone,
she’d be devastated.

Malibu, One Day Later

You left rehab early?

There wasn’t any point in staying longer.

And you broke your celibacy contract to sleep with Ingrid?

She’s my girlfriend and she wanted to have sex.

And you fantasized about someone else?

Only so I could please Ingrid.

All I’m hearing are excuses for going only halfway. No wonder you’re
still cheating.

_Rick and I are in his Range Rover, discussing my idiotic text. We park
in the gravel driveway of a house available for rent. It looks like the
kind of giant hippie tree house that Father Yod and his wives would have
lived in._

I can explain.

I’m all ears.

_Spoken with a wry smile, as if he’s preparing to be deeply amused by
whatever I say next._

There were two schools of thought in rehab. One was taught by a very
compassionate woman named Lorraine: From her, we learned that we weren’t
there for our partners but ourselves. And the goal is to separate from
our parents and our wounds so we can live our authentic lives.

And the other?

The other school of thought was more puritanical. It was taught by a
very strict woman named Joan. And she believes that masturbation,
pornography, seduction, fantasy, and casual sex are all unhealthy. And
that basically anything other than lifelong monogamy is a symptom of
sexual addiction and intimacy avoidance.

Why can’t they both be right?

You gotta be kidding me. Then nearly every male in the country should be
in rehab.

Who goes to rehab and just picks and chooses what they like? I think you
have a false belief about how men are that you’re using as a way of not
feeling emasculated in the world. You were unhappy before in your old
ways when you were single and you’re unhappy now in a relationship. You
can go on this way for five or ten years, and all you’ll do is waste a
lot of time sitting on the fence.

So what should I do? I’m so confused.

_I see the look of pity in Rick’s eyes, like I’m some sort of lesser
life form, a two-dimensional creature trying to understand the concept
of three dimensions._

Here’s what I suggest: Go into sex addiction recovery all the way.
Starting today, everything an expert tells you, just do it without
challenging it. Even if all you find are therapists like Joan who you
don’t agree with, hand over control anyway. If they tell you no sex for
ninety days, then don’t have sex for ninety days. If they tell you no
masturbation or porn, then cut those things out.

_I know I need to do something drastic, but . . ._

You want me to just go along with even the most extreme things these
people say, without thinking about whether they make any logical sense
or are true to myself?

Yes, exactly. How do you think I lost 135 pounds? I tried to lose weight
for years, but I wasn’t able to do it until I finally gave up control to
a nutritionist and a trainer. I didn’t think about whether anything they
said was true. I didn’t even believe it would work. But I just submitted
to the process and did it without judgment.

_I think back to the moment of clarity I had in the chair with Lorraine.
What would that opened-up version of myself advise me to do?_

_He would say to just let go and love Ingrid._

Okay, I’ll try it.

Don’t try. Do it. Really get into recovery and feel it for at least
ninety days. And if at the end of that time, you’re still not happy,
then do what you feel is right. Find an open relationship, go crazy,
have all the sex with all the people you want and see how that feels.
The goal is not monogamy or nonmonogamy. It’s for you to be living a
life that brings you happiness.

That sounds like a great way to get off the fence before I fuck up my
relationship again.

It may be your last chance. If you can’t stick with it, maybe God will
find a way for you to stick with it.

What’s that supposed to mean?

It means that if you can’t control your lust, the universe will take
care of it for you.

_He says this ominously, as if lightning is going to strike my prick or
it’s going to get stuck in a blender if I don’t keep it zipped up._

And so I’m back: facing the firing squad.

This time, the bullets are being loaded by Sheila Cartwright, Charles’s
therapist, supposedly the best in L.A. for sex addiction. She’s an older
woman with dreadlocks and beads in her hair like a teenage hippie, but
she’s sitting in a large armchair with a blanket over her legs like an
old lady. In the spirit of Joan and Lorraine before her, she’s another
single woman surrounded by male sex addicts.

Adam is also here. So is Calvin. Evidently they were smart enough to
stay in touch with Charles and join his private therapy group
immediately on reentry. There are also five cheaters I don’t know, three
of whom have been in the group for over ten years.

“It’s too bad there’s no such thing as a woman who’ll let you do what
you want and still love you,” Calvin says, nudging me in the ribs, as we
sit in adjacent mismatched chairs in the therapy room.

It feels good to be with my dysfunctional buddies again, except this
time, I need to be more like Charles and go along with the entire
program.

The meeting begins with each addict checking in and letting Sheila know
how his week went. Instead of lecturing us like Joan, she _feels_ for
us, in what seems like a tactic to get us more in touch with our own
feelings. As Calvin tells us that he’s thinking of returning to Brazil
to be with his hooker when she gives birth to their son, she exhales
slowly and melodramatically, and looks at him with big, soft eyes, as if
trying to absorb the pain and the hurt that he’s not even aware he has.

“I was alone with my wife last night, so I asked her if she wanted to
fool around,” Adam says during his check-in. “She got really mad, and
she told me it was inappropriate and not intimate and not the way she
likes to be propositioned. So it turned into a whole blowup.”

After Sheila emotes for Adam and advises him to start with hand-holding,
it’s my turn to check in. I tell the group about the woman on the plane,
the temptations of my inbox, the text to Belle, and renewing my
commitment to recovery.

Sheila’s response is a hiss of escaping air and a sad puppy dog
expression. She looks like she’s trying to send me love. And, for some
reason, it makes me uncomfortable. I’m not sure if that’s because she
seems insincere or if, although I’m used to sex with no strings
attached, I’m unaccustomed to emotion with no strings attached.

When I smile awkwardly at her, Sheila finally speaks, ever so slowly:
“What you’re doing is sexual hoarding. When there’s a problem in your
relationship, you feel shame—like something is wrong with you—and
there’s an immediate reaction to that called _defensive grandiosity_.
And that’s when you start checking your hoard of messages.” She shifts
in her chair and the blanket slides off her lap. “And that’s fueled by
anger, because it drives Ingrid away and makes you feel like you have
power.”

Sheila looks through a copy of the file from rehab listing all my
ailments, real and imagined. She stands up slowly, placing her leg
blanket back on the chair, then removes a book from a shelf and hands it
to me. The title is _Silently Seduced_.

“Read this,” she recommends. “It’s you.”

Charles leans forward in his chair and tells me, “Next time you see a
woman like that one on the plane, use the three-second rule.”

I’m stunned. The three-second rule was something I learned during my
time with the pickup artists_:_ It means that when you see a woman
you’re attracted to, you have three seconds to approach her—otherwise,
either she’ll notice you staring or you’ll get too nervous to talk to
her. “You mean I should start a conversation with her?”

“No!” he says, horrified. “The three-second rule means that as soon as
you see someone and start objectifying them or fantasizing about them,
you have a maximum of three seconds to focus on something else before
the thought starts to get too strong and lead you into the addiction
cycle. Remember”—he wags a finger—“bright red apple, wrong orchard.”

As I walk back to my car after the meeting, I flip through the book
Sheila gave me and read a passage. The author, Dr. Kenneth Adams,
writes: “Covert incest occurs when a child becomes the object of a
parent’s affection, love, passion, and preoccupation. The parent,
motivated by loneliness and emptiness created by a chronically troubled
marriage or relationship, makes the child a surrogate partner. . . . To
the child, the parent’s love feels more confining than freeing, more
demanding than giving, and more intrusive than nurturing.”

Suddenly, a lost memory comes back to me. It arrives first as a scent of
sweet petroleum, then a vision of white cream. When most of my
classmates were going to bed at ten or eleven at night, my bedtime was
seven thirty. However, my mother would let me stay up and watch TV until
eight if I massaged her hands or feet. I’d pump moisturizer into my
palms, then caress it into her olive, veined skin. When I finished,
she’d tell me, “You’re so much better than your father at this.” At the
time, I took it as a compliment, but now a shudder of disgust runs
through me.

As a result of this confusing dynamic, Adams continues, when the child
grows up, relationships often begin with “immediate and total
commitment,” but this is soon “followed by uncertainty and ambivalence.”
And, often, “having an affair is a way to be relieved of the struggle
with commitment.”

When I shut the book, I see Charles standing next to me. I have no idea
how long he’s been there. I thank him for getting me into the group. In
response, he opens a satchel he’s carrying and pulls out a copy of _The
Game_.

“Alfred Nobel,” he says.

I wait for the rest of the sentence. But evidently that’s it. “What
about him?”

“Know him?”

“Not personally.”

“Alfred Nobel, the same guy who invented dynamite, went on to create the
Nobel Peace Prize.”

He looks at me, trying to make sure his point landed. And slowly what
he’s trying to say dawns on me: that a book about learning how to meet
women is destructive, and a book about learning how to stop meeting them
would be good for the world. And ironic.

“I understand,” I tell him.

He tucks the book away and hands me a brochure for Sex and Love Addicts
Anonymous. The first sentence reads: “We in SLAA believe that sex and
love addiction is a progressive illness which cannot be cured but which,
like many illnesses, can be arrested.”

“Let me ask you something,” Charles says sharply, watching me. “Have you
finally recognized that you have a disease?”

I tell him, honestly, “I can recognize it as a disease in a metaphorical
sense.”

“No, it’s a real disease. Because it’s not a choice. It may start off as
a choice, but if you do anything to cope with stress or pain, the
structure of the brain changes and the behavior can go from an impulse
to an addiction.”

“If that qualifies as a disease,” I respond, recalling my pledge to
Rick, “then I guess I have it.”

Charles seems unconvinced. “Let me do you a favor and prove to you that
this is a disease. I’m going to set you up with a friend of mine, Dr.
Daniel Amen. He’s a brain expert specializing in addiction. He’ll scan
your brain for free, and show you exactly where the disease is in your
head and how to treat it.”

And I think, This is crazy. But I say, “Thank you.”

8

Dr. Daniel Amen is a small, balding man—the son of a Lebanese grocery
mogul—who has become, according to the _Washington Post,_ “the most
popular psychiatrist in America.”

In the waiting room outside his office, a PBS TV program featuring the
good doctor plays on infinite loop. I try to tune out his well-scripted
patter about using brain scans for behavior assessment and modification
while I work up the courage to go through the messages I’ve been
ignoring on my phone.

I scroll down the list and start politely responding to each tempting
text, making sure to mention my girlfriend.

Belle, the Australian who I didn’t unwrap for her birthday, says she’s
going to be stuck in Los Angeles on an overnight layover and wants to
know if I’ll be in town. I tell her, “Don’t know yet. But I have a gf,
so can see you only as a friend.”

Anne, my online temptation from France, has sent another nude photo,
this one of her pole-dancing, her body curving in the air like tinder
feeding the fire of my fantasy life. I write back, “Have enjoyed
corresponding with you. Wish I’d met you in person, but in a
relationship now.”

Each reply is painful, like hammering a nail into my scrotum. But I do
it: Because I believe. Because I’m behaving. Because I want to become.

I’m interrupted by a thin, sultry receptionist who calls me in to meet
with Amen. His office staff seems to consist solely of attractive women
in their twenties and thirties. I start to wonder if he has some
undiagnosed sexual compulsiveness himself.

When I enter Amen’s office, he’s sitting in a high-backed swivel chair,
swallowed in oversized clothing as if his body doesn’t matter, only his
brain. The walls are decorated with pictures of penguins, which have
something to do with a children’s book he wrote on positive
reinforcement. In his hands, he’s holding a sheaf of papers with green
splotches on them that look like Hercules’s snot stains. They are,
collectively, my brain, and it looks like this:

[image]

Though Amen specializes in a type of brain scan that involves injecting
patients with a radioactive isotope, I opted instead for a
safer-sounding EEG test, which was performed earlier by a tall blond
neuroscientist in high-waisted leggings.

“Is that a pervert’s brain?” I ask Amen.

“Have you ever been knocked out?” he inquires, ignoring the question—or
maybe answering it.

“Only once.” I tell him about an afternoon more than a decade before
when a group of guys attacked me for no apparent reason as I was walking
to my apartment in Manhattan.

“Where exactly did they hit you?”

“I think the blow that knocked me out was here.” I touch the upper left
side of my skull.

“That could be important.”

“In what way?”

“Your brain is really soft and your skull is really hard, and inside
your skull there are a whole bunch of ridges. The incidence of head
trauma in sex addicts is huge, and nobody knows that because most
addicts see therapists. And the problem with therapists is, they tell
you all about your brain, but they never actually look at it.”

“So do I have brain damage?” Fuck, another item to add to the grocery
list of what’s wrong with me.

“Your scan showed some mild evidence of injury.” He studies the images
again, decoding a language few understand. “You also have, and this is
sort of funny, high slow-wave activities. Do you know about ADD?”

“I know about it.”

“Did anybody ever suggest you had it?”

“No, never.”

“I think a lot of your behavior is classic ADD stuff, especially the
excitement seeking and the conflict. Wanting to be with new women is a
biological drive to keep the species going, but it’s totally destructive
when you can’t pair-bond appropriately and then be involved in raising a
family.”

As he speaks, I realize that’s the exact problem: These two
contradictory evolutionary desires—for variety and for family—have been
tearing me apart. And on the journey to reconcile them, not only am I
getting neither, but I’m discovering I’m insane.

Two months ago, I was just a jerk who cheated on his girlfriend and felt
really shitty about it. I’d never seen or even wanted to see a therapist
in my life. Now all of a sudden I have generalized anxiety syndrome,
depressive disorder, socialization problems, brain damage, ADD, sex
addiction, eroticized rage, developmental trauma disorder, emotional
incest syndrome, Axis V impairment, and who knows what else. It’s a
miracle I can function in society at all.

“I’m also noticing here that when your eyes were open, the back part of
your brain fired up a lot more. Which is a bad thing.”

“Why is that?” I don’t think I can take another disorder. I might as
well just get a lobotomy at this point.

“Because that means you notice everybody who passes by.”

“Yeah, that’s been somewhat of a problem.”

“When your visual center is turned on all the time like that, it can be
painful to your partner if you’re not careful.” He laughs. I laugh. We
relate. We are men. I look down and notice his wedding ring. “How does
your girlfriend react when you’re out and do that?”

“She’s been good about it, but I really haven’t done it lately. Except .
. .” I tell him about my recent lapses.

“Well, part of it is patterning,” he replies. “You worked so hard to
figure out women that you’re still like a hunter. It’s so deeply
ingrained, you’re not going to be able to just walk out of here and stop
it. The other problem is that your prefrontal cortex, the part of your
brain that’s supposed to act as the brake, is a little weak. So when you
see a really pretty girl and you go, I’d love to have sex with her, your
frontal lobe then plays it out.”

It’s confirmed: I’ve got a mind like a streaming-porn site. I have a
future as a dirty old man to look forward to when my prefrontal cortex
deteriorates even more with age. “So does my brain suggest sex
addiction, then?”

He flips through my EEG results and concludes: My prefrontal cortex is
weak, making it difficult to repress my instincts; my anterior cingulate
gyrus (which he describes as a gear shifter that helps the brain switch
between different thoughts and activities) gets stuck, making me
obsessive about women I encounter; and my emotional lobes are
overactive, so I can easily be provoked into acting out by something
Ingrid says or does—even if I’m not conscious of the exact trigger.

Finally, he says grimly: “The brain has safety circuits that form when
we experience repetitive physical and emotional caretaking from
nurturing, predictable, secure figures. If your mom is handicapped and
had to hire a babysitter after failing to take care of you on her own,
that means there’s probably little or no safety-circuit formation in
your brain. So you can fall in love for the short term, but long-term
emotional attachment may be harder to achieve and sustain.”

In other words, on top of everything else, half the lobes and circuits
of my brain are fucked up. “Do you think there’s any truth to the saying
that a man is as faithful as his options?” I ask, hoping for a small
reprieve.

“I don’t think that’s true,” he replies adamantly. “You’re as faithful
as you decide to be if your brain is healthy. If your brain is not
healthy, then you’re as faithful as your options. And we’re going to
make your brain healthy.”

He then prescribes a lengthy regimen to heal my screwed-up head:
neurofeedback to retrain my brain, herbal supplements to improve my
frontal lobe functioning, a healthy diet to keep my blood sugar
balanced, omega-3 and vitamin D to reduce my cravings, and, yes, more
sex addiction therapy.

He sends me away with a cardboard box loaded with his books, audio
programs, and branded supplements. When I return home, I look up local
sex addiction meetings to attend, order a Patrick Carnes recovery kit,
research neurofeedback clinicians, and call Charles about finding a
sponsor.

This is my new life.

_F_ast-forward through ten months of meetings and step study groups,
working to curb my lust with my fellow former philanderers. Ten months
of group therapy, learning to be emotional and powerless with Sheila
Cartwright. Ten months of one-on-one therapy, reporting my every carnal
thought to an additional sex addiction therapist. Ten months of
neurofeedback and supplements and everything else Daniel Amen
prescribed. Ten months of filling out Patrick Carnes’s workbooks and
reading his daily meditations and talking to sponsors and letting go to
higher powers and making inventories of my sex life.

And where am I?

The sun is setting and I’m taking a short break from reading _Facing
Love Addiction_ by Pia Mellody, which my sex addiction therapist
recommended finishing before our next session, to answer a call from
Adam. Suddenly, I hear Ingrid’s steps outside. Purposely loud. Each
obnoxious stomp of her heels on the wood forms a word in a sentence:
“I’m . . . coming . . . home . . . stop . . . whatever . . . you . . .
are . . . doing . . . and . . . pay . . . attention . . . to . . . me!”

Adam and I have been talking every night, and I’ve come to admire him. I
don’t think he’s even looked twice at another woman since leaving rehab.
He’s just been trying to get his wife to look at him.

He’s in the middle of telling me that his soccer team was practicing
with one of the women’s teams, and even though there was nothing
inappropriate about it, his wife saw this, got jealous, and flipped out.
She said she doesn’t trust him anymore to play soccer.

“So what are you going to do?”

“You know, Neil, I looked at my wife and I understood. I thought, How
could someone want to be with me after what I’ve done? I always think,
How can I give her back what I’ve taken away from her by my affair? So
I’m gonna stop playing soccer for a while. I want to show her that our
relationship is what’s most important to me.”

Now Ingrid’s knocking—even though I gave her the house keys when she
moved in. The rapping is nonstop. It’s not polite, like a neighbor, or
even impolite, like someone delivering a package. It’s just annoying,
like someone hitting a pipe with a hammer when you’re trying to sleep.

“I gotta go, Adam. But I don’t think you should quit doing the things
you love just because she feels threatened by them. Let’s talk later.”

I slip the phone in my pocket and walk to the door to let Ingrid in.

“Wanna watch _The Twilight Zone_?” she asks, bursting inside, grinning
ear to ear. She places Hercules on the floor and stomps in circles
around him, trying to make me laugh.

“Not right now. I have to read for a little.”

Her face drops. Following the advice in _Silently Seduced,_ I’ve been
making an effort to put my needs first in the relationship to avoid
feeling enmeshed. But so far all it seems to be doing is intensifying
Ingrid’s own abandonment fears, because now she thinks I’m falling out
of love with her and is constantly seeking reassurance.

“Skittykitts?” she chirps. It’s a card game a friend of ours invented.

“When I’m done with this chapter, okay?” I find it easy to say no once,
but after two or three requests, I start to feel guilty and lose my
resolve. Sheila tells me that continuously complying with someone else’s
priorities at the expense of my own is called _pathological
accommodation_.

“Okay!” She hugs me. I hug her back. At each point where her body makes
contact with mine, a nerve ending freezes and stiffens. The chain
reaction builds all the way to my heart until, finally, she releases me.

When Ingrid and I were at a rooftop bar last week, she was tipsy and
clingy—and I was seized by an inexplicable impulse to hurl myself over
the divider and into the void below. That’s when I understood why some
people spontaneously jump off rooftops and bridges and window ledges:
They do it because it’s easier than almost everything else in life. It’s
easier to jump than divorce your wife, easier to jump than try to win a
girlfriend back, easier to jump than ask your boss for a raise, easier
to jump than deal with your growing pile of unpaid bills, easier to jump
than face your wife and kids after letting them down, easier to jump
than spend every day in meetings and therapy trying to be someone you’re
not. It’s easier—and quicker. It solves every problem with certainty,
swiftness, and finality.

I sit on the sofa and continue reading the book, hoping Ingrid will get
the hint. Instead, she sits next to me, cranes her head over my
shoulder, and reads the page out loud, her voice histrionic and
staccato, trying to be funny: “Resentment is the anger the Avoidant
feels because of thinking he or she has been victimized by the partner’s
neediness or by the partner’s ‘demands’ for connection in the
relationship.”

She tries to make eye contact, which I don’t return. “Do you feel like
that?”

My sponsor advised me to always be honest and vulnerable, no matter how
difficult it may be. So I tell Ingrid, “I’m feeling it right now.” I
force a smile so the words don’t seem too harsh.

She touches her temple and closes her eyes for a moment, taking it in.
“Can I ask you a question?”

“I don’t know. Can it wait?” Her face starts to fall. I can’t take an
argument right now, so I pathologically accommodate. “Okay, what is it?”

“Why is this relationship different from your other ones?”

It seems not just like a need for reassurance, but an accusation.
“Because I enjoy being with you. I appreciate you inside and out. And
you make me laugh.”

She folds her arms across her chest. “So I just make you laugh. Is that
_it_?”

“No, I love you.” And I really do. Just not right now.

“What do you love about me?”

“It’s a feeling. I get it in my heart when I’m with you.” Just not right
now.

She’s silent.

“What’s the problem? I feel like I’m being cross-examined, but I don’t
know what I’m being charged with.”

She bites her lower lip and gazes down at Hercules. Then she hits me
with it: “So why are you working so hard to stay in this relationship?”

It’s a good question. One I’ve been asking myself lately. I think back
on my past girlfriends: I broke up with Kathy because she was constantly
jealous. I broke up with Katie because she kept cheating on me. And I
broke up with Lisa, my most serious relationship before this, because
she started to remind me of my mother.

But with Ingrid, I can’t find anything hopelessly wrong with her, any
way to use her behavior or shortcomings as an excuse to flee. Sure,
she’s being a pain in the ass right now. And she shuts down when she’s
angry, smothers me with affection, demands my attention when I want to
work, can be needy due to her abandonment issues, and has some
understandable insecurities because I cheated. But these are all things
a guy can live with.

So if I can’t find anything significantly wrong with her, then I must
accept the only other conclusion available: the problem is still me. And
after months of working on me, I’m a bigger mess than I was when this
whole thing started. When I was dating Ingrid and cheating behind her
back, everything was in stasis. She was happy. I was happy enough. We
were living in ignorant bliss.

Those were the good old lies.

But now, everything I once thought I liked about myself has been turned
into a symptom of something wrong with me. I’m told over and over by
addiction experts not to trust anything I say, think, or feel. They tell
me I need to build self-esteem from within. Yet in order to do that, I
have to accept that I’m broken, shattered, stigmatized, diseased, and
traumatized—and all that does is make me want to throw myself off a
rooftop so I can start all over again.

And so instead of being healed, I’ve become raw, edgy, irritable, and
moody. The blood flowing through my veins feels like it’s filled with
sand and broken glass. And my sexuality is boiling over. Despite using
the three-second rule, I’m attracted to any woman under three hundred
pounds and some cartoon characters. I feel like the drunk who can’t get
any booze, then starts chugging mouthwash and rubbing alcohol. I’m ready
to scrape the bottom of the barrel. And Ingrid’s become so sensitive to
my moods that I’m sure she’s aware of this.

“Well, why?” she asks again. Didn’t I tell her thirty times already that
I wanted some alone time to read? How am I supposed to take care of my
needs when she won’t listen to me?

As I’m trying to figure out how to respond without creating a worse
scene, my phone beeps. I check it quickly: It’s a text from Calvin,
who’s just returned from Brazil and sent a picture of his baby boy. I
return the phone to my pocket without answering him.

“Who was that?”

“That was Calvin. From my therapy group.”

She frowns and squints at me. “It seems like you’re hiding something.”

“No, I just thought it would be rude to respond to him while we were
talking.”

“Well, it seemed sneaky.”

I want to tell her to lay off me, to remind her that she said she
trusted me, to ask to see her fucking phone. But I manage to stay—just
barely—in the functional adult. “It really was Calvin. You can check my
phone. I’ve been totally good.” Actually, I think I’m in the
punished-adolescent ego state.

“I don’t need to do that.”

She strokes my face lightly, so soft it feels more irritating than
soothing, like a fly buzzing around my cheek. “I’m sorry,” she says,
looking into my eyes, hoping for something in return.

But all I feel is a rising tide of revulsion. In the last ten minutes,
we’ve gone through a whole mini–soap opera of love, suspicion, and
reconciliation. I’m emotionally exhausted.

I look into her eyes and try to stop the enmeshed monster inside me from
taking over, but it’s too late. The love I see shining there is like a
bear trap, snapped shut on my soul to keep me from straying. I am a
prisoner of fear. And in that moment, I realize that the
self-destructive impulse I’ve had lately is not actually about wanting
to hurt myself. It’s about freedom. It’s about not wanting to live under
constant scrutiny, to be responsible for her feelings, to feel guilty if
I happen to have a sexual thought that’s not about her, to feel like my
every word or expression is a red-hot brand that may scar her.

Once again, my girlfriend has turned into my mother: Ingrid doesn’t
trust me, she doesn’t give me space, and her happiness seems to depend
almost entirely on my behavior.

Things could be worse, I futilely try to console myself. At least Ingrid
trusts me with the keys to the house.

I head to the bathroom to be alone for a few moments, first setting the
phone on the table so Ingrid doesn’t think I’m sneaking any texts in
there. I close the door and stand in front of the mirror, staring
blankly at the face staring blankly back at me. There are crow’s-feet
forming around my eyes; the creases of worry in my forehead are starting
to turn into actual wrinkles; and I’m getting gray hairs in my beard.
Maybe I’ve passed my peak. The decaying process has begun.

When is this sex addiction recovery going to start working? I can’t go
on like this forever. Pretty soon, I’m going to be too old to be a good
dad who can still relate to his children and play ball with them. It’s
been almost a year and I’m definitely not happy. It seems more like I’m
repressing my authentic self than becoming it.

When I return from the bathroom, Ingrid’s sitting at the kitchen table
with my phone in her hand. Her eyes are blazing and her jaw is thrust
out, but I have no idea why she looks so angry. I’ve done nothing wrong.

“Who’s Belle?”

Except for that. I get a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach.
Passwords are useless when you have a suspicious girlfriend who likes
reading over your shoulder.

“What are you doing looking at my phone?” I snap. If only she’d have let
me read in peace.

“Who is she?” Ingrid asks again. Angrier, louder, more abrasive. I try
to answer, but my breath catches in my throat and burns there with
shame.

Guilt is about the way you breathe. Shame is about the fact that you
breathe.

“She’s just some girl I slept with a long time ago, before I ever met
you,” I finally manage to utter. “I don’t know why I stayed in touch
with her. I’m so sorry. It was really dumb. I have a weak prefrontal
cortex.”

“Give me my key back.”

“No, not that!” The key around my neck, the symbol of trust. Anything
but that.

“I can’t believe you would do that, Neil. Give me my key.”

She grabs the necklace and pulls hard on the chain, trying to break the
clasp.

“Okay, okay, just let go.”

She’s right. I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve her.

I’m not angry anymore. At least not at her. I’m pissed at myself. I
remove the necklace and give her the key to her file cabinet back. I
told Belle I was in a relationship, but she kept sending flirtatious
messages. And though I didn’t encourage her again, I didn’t do enough to
discourage her either—and I definitely fantasized about her a lot. I
should have ignored her or blocked her number, and had the courage to
immediately apologize to Ingrid after I fucked up the first time.

Perhaps relationships are like heart surgery: Even the smallest mistake
can be fatal. And now I’ve undone almost a year of earning Ingrid’s
trust back. It must have been my enmeshment or pathological
accommodation or sex addiction or ADD or damaged brain or all of them
working together in a symphony of self-sabotage.

Ingrid takes the key, storms out of the house, gets in her car, and
drives away.

And now I’ve gotten my wish: I’m alone. I can breathe. I can read. I can
do whatever I want.

And it sucks.

“I can’t go on like this,” I tell Calvin as we sit at a Japanese curry
restaurant a week later, discussing the situation.

“I’ve gone through a lot of emotions about this stuff too,” Calvin
replies. “There’s no end to it. It’s not like, ‘Go do this work for a
few months or years, then you’ll be better.’ They want us to be in
meetings and therapy for the rest of our lives.”

He reaches into the back pocket of his jeans and pulls out a folded
piece of paper. “Look at this.”

It’s a printout of an article about a guy named Robert Weiss who runs a
treatment center in Los Angeles called the Sexual Recovery Institute.

“Not another place.”

“Read it,” Calvin urges. “Troy emailed it to me. Rob Weiss used to work
with Patrick Carnes, but their egos clashed or something so he broke off
and started his own center.”

I read that the Sexual Recovery Institute was sold to Elements
Behavioral Health, a big rehab chain, and they’re planning to take
Weiss’s institute nationwide, with luxury sex addiction centers around
the country for, as the article puts it, “wealthy sex addicts,” and
two-week outpatient programs “for those of lesser means.”

“Can’t you see what’s going on?” Calvin presses. “Think about it: If you
add up all the people who’ve cheated in their relationships, that’s tens
of millions of customers in the U.S. alone. Now add to that the even
huger number of people who watch porn, and this is the smartest business
plan in the world. If they turn being male and horny into some kind of
brain cancer that’s covered by health insurance, they’ll be
billionaires.”

“It would be one thing if the treatment worked,” I gripe. “But it’s
taken over my entire life. Like half the time, I’m too busy going to
meetings and reading books on intimacy to actually be intimate with
Ingrid.”

After finding the texts with Belle, Ingrid spent the night sleeping on
the sofa in her office. Though we talked it through for hours when she
finally came home, she’s shown no signs of forgiving or forgetting.

“It’s no joke,” Calvin replies. “There are a bunch of websites about
this. Remember when Joan made me add up all the money I spent on sex?
Well, if I keep doing this, I’ll end up spending even more money on
recovery.”

I hate that everything he’s saying makes sense . . . and I’m relieved
that everything he’s saying makes sense.

“Most people who go to rehab relapse,” he continues. “So what’s the
point? And Sheila doesn’t want me to bring Mariana and Flavio”—his
Brazilian and their baby—“over here, because it’s not good for my
recovery. But that’s my son, and I have to do what’s in my heart. That
can’t be wrong, right?”

“I don’t know what’s right anymore, man. I don’t know. But despite my
frustration, I have to say, the enmeshment stuff really fits me like a
glove.”

“That part may be true, but remember: This is the same profession that
said homosexuality was a disease and gave gay people electroshock
treatment and lobotomies. And, you know what, back then, therapists
probably blamed it on smothering mothers also. Maybe we’re just
different sexually but the world hasn’t accepted it yet.”

He’s making a good argument, too dangerous to consider. When I grew up,
there were two women in my life: my mother and a live-in babysitter. So
maybe it’s natural for me to want multiple female caregivers. And who’s
to say that this broad definition of sex addiction we’ve been learning
isn’t just modern-day quackery, with Carnes as the Kevorkian of the male
libido?

Doctors used to claim there was a disease called drapetomania—a disorder
in which slaves were seized by the irrational and pathological desire to
be freed from their masters. They’re all just words, made up by people
with degrees, to enforce social norms.

“You may be right,” I respond noncommittally. “It could just be the way
we’re wired.”

Perhaps sex addiction is the new ADD or Asperger’s syndrome. It’s very
real for some people, but it’s also massively overdiagnosed and anyone
who doesn’t fit a certain unrealistic standard of behavior is labeled
with it. Pretty soon, just like there are six-year-old kids taking
Ritalin and Adderall, some poor child who strips a Barbie doll naked
will be getting sex addiction treatment.

“We got sucked into a weird fringe pseudoscience.” Calvin stabs a fork
into his chicken cutlet. “Most of this stuff has never been proven. Talk
to scientists. Talk to doctors. Talk to other therapists. Talk to any
single person except for Patrick Carnes and his minions. Even that brain
doctor you went to isn’t taken seriously by most of the medical
community.”

Rick told me to trust the experts, but maybe I just chose the wrong
ones.

“Sex addiction isn’t even in the DSM,” Calvin goes on, his ovoid face
heated red. “It was considered and completely rejected! We’ve been
chasing a ghost.”

11

One of the benefits of writing for _Rolling Stone_ is that I can get
just about anyone on the phone. So after talking to Calvin, I go on a
rampage for knowledge, contacting as many of the world’s most credible
relationship experts as I can to get their point of view on the issues
we discussed.

I start with the anthropologist Dr. Helen Fisher. For more than two
decades, she’s been studying love, sex, and marriage across cultures,
species, and time—becoming, in the process, arguably the most cited
living researcher on the science of relationships.

Her conclusion: “We’re an adulterous animal.”

In her book _Anatomy of Love,_ she explains the origins of this
behavior: “During our long evolutionary history most males pursued
trysts to spread their genes, while females evolved two _alternative_
strategies to acquire resources: some women elected to be relatively
faithful to a single man in order to reap a lot of benefits from him;
others engaged in clandestine sex with many men to acquire resources
from each. This scenario roughly coincides with the common beliefs: man,
the natural playboy; woman, the madonna or the whore.”

Based on her current research, however, Fisher feels a little
differently about that passage in the book. “I think I would amend that
if I could write it now,” she tells me. “Among men and women under the
age of forty today, women are just as adulterous as men.”

Fisher explains that our ancestors unfaithfully pair-bonded just long
enough to conceive and raise a child until it developed some degree of
autonomy, then they moved on to raise a child with (and cheat on)
someone else. She describes this as a dual reproductive strategy: serial
monogamy plus clandestine adultery.

So, I think as she explains all this, if my goal is to be in a
relationship that’s true to my authentic self, then cheating on Ingrid
was the way to do it. Now all I need to do is marry her, father a couple
of children, start cheating again, be cheated on, and divorce. This is
evidently love among _Homo sapiens_. Call it _fauxnogamy._

However, even if Fisher’s theory is true, there’s a problem with this
lifestyle in the modern world. As the red demons and I unfortunately
discovered, it causes a lot of pain, destroys any hope of intimacy, and
traumatizes everyone in the family. In addition to the ethical issues,
with keystroke-capturing software, phone bills, credit card statements,
and social-networking profiles with tagged photos all easily accessible,
it’s almost impossible for a cheater not to leave a technological slime
trail for a determined partner to discover.

So I ask Fisher how to best overcome our evolutionary past and have a
successful, lasting relationship today. She responds by explaining that
we’ve developed three different primary brain systems for mating: one
for sex, another for romantic love, and a third for deep attachment. And
after the initial intensity of a new relationship, our romance and sex
drives often swing toward other people, while our attachment drive
remains connected to our primary partner.

However, before I can draw any conclusions, Fisher says that this
natural ebbing of romance and sexuality can be prevented. The solution,
she elaborates, is for couples to do novel and exciting things together
(to release dopamine and get the romance rush), make love regularly (to
release oxytocin and sexually bond), cut themselves off from cheating
opportunities, and, in general, make sure their partners are
“continually thrilling” enough to keep all three drives humming.

“Wow, that’s a lot to ask of two people,” I tell her.

“Yes, and even then you still may want to sleep with other people on the
side,” Fisher retorts. “So if you’re gonna cheat, for god’s sake, don’t
get caught.”

That’s it, then: Helen Fisher, the world’s leading expert on mating, has
given me permission to cheat. I’m shocked that this is the prevailing
scientific consensus on relationships. I’ve been working so hard to
accept the premise that my desire for other women is a lifelong disease
and only faith in a higher power can put it in remission. But perhaps
it’s not enmeshment or trauma or sex addiction that makes the notion of
lifelong monogamy so unappealing. It’s just, as I initially told Rick,
part of our nature.

Even Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the fathers of modern psychotherapy,
appear to have had affairs: the former with his wife’s sister, the
latter with a patient. “The prerequisite for a good marriage, it seems
to me, is the license to be unfaithful,” Jung wrote in a letter to
Freud. And Bill W., the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was so
notorious for cheating on his wife with attractive women who attended
sobriety meetings that his colleagues later started calling this type of
lechery the thirteenth step.

By Carnes’s standards, they’d be addicts. By Fisher’s, they’d be
successful _Homo sapiens_. By society’s, they’d be creeps. It’s all very
confusing.

Over the next few days, I dive deeper into the science of mating. But
I’m unable to find a single credible item in the entire canon of
evolutionary and anthropological literature that supports the contention
that human beings are supposed to pick one partner and then remain
faithfully and exclusively with that person for life.

On top of everything, I’d been feeling so guilty for avoiding intimacy
with Ingrid by fantasizing. But, it turns out, a study on sexual
fantasies conducted by researchers at the University of Vermont
concluded that 98 percent of men (and 80 percent of women) report having
sexual fantasies about people other than their partners.

So of course it’s a struggle to focus 100 percent of my sexual attention
and desire on Ingrid. I’m fucking normal. There’s something liberating
about that thought. Because I’m tired of beating myself up every day.

Even when I finally manage to find a group of researchers studying the
benefits of monogamy to society—historically, it’s increased the number
of available women and reduced the number of single men, leading to less
competition for partners and reduced crime and violence—they admit that
not only does their definition of monogamy not preclude cheating, but
they don’t believe that monogamy is natural either.

“If it were all genetic, if humans just by nature mated for life and
there were a very tight pair-bond,” Professor Peter J. Richerson
explains, “then we wouldn’t need all these marriage customs.”

As for marriage itself, historian Stephanie Coontz, the author of
_Marriage, a History_, tells me that the tradition was never even
supposed to be about intimacy. For the majority of its history, marriage
was an economic and political institution, mostly about merging
resources, forming alliances, or creating a bloodline for inheritance,
she explains. Not until the late eighteenth century did people marry for
love. And it took until the late twentieth century for marriage to start
becoming an intimate partnership rather than a patriarchal institution.

Today, Coontz believes that the tradition is changing yet again. “People
want to be monogamous or promiscuous, they want kids or they don’t want
kids, they want this or they want that,” she says. “For centuries, they
had to hide those preferences and take everything as a package deal. Now
you don’t have to: It’s literally pick and choose. Cut and paste the
kind of life you want. Family life and love relationships are
essentially becoming a build-your-own model.”

Perhaps Calvin was right, I think as I leave Coontz’s house that
evening. Maybe we have been brainwashed. Either that or we’re living in
a twenty-first century culture that’s moving quickly, but stuck in
twentieth century institutions that change too slowly.

Then again, no matter what your point of view may be, you can always
find someone with a Ph.D to support it.

12

And so I find myself, nearly a year after returning from rehab, caught
between one school of thought telling me I have an incurable
psychosexual disease I need to treat daily, and another making a very
convincing argument that over two hundred thousand years of human
culture and evolution support my behavior as perfectly natural.

In the meantime, my relationship with Ingrid has become a roller
coaster. One minute we’re laughing together and staring lovingly into
each other’s eyes, the next we’re either arguing or not speaking. Most
nights, I end up sleeping on the couch. Meanwhile, Hercules has somehow
gone from sleeping on the floor next to the bed to sleeping on the
comforter at the bottom of the bed to sleeping on a pillow at the head
of the bed to spooning with Ingrid.

One afternoon, for a _Rolling Stone_ article I’m writing, the British
singer Ellie Goulding meets me in Malibu to play some music she’s been
working on. We paddleboard in the ocean, and discuss her art and her
life. When Ingrid comes home from work with Hercules in tow, I fill her
in on the day.

“We talked a lot about abandonment, because her dad walked out on her
and her mom,” I recap. “One day she was feeling really sad, so she
texted him and asked, ‘Do you still love me?’ But her father’s new wife
texted back and said to leave him alone and stop bothering him. It’s so
cruel. We were both practically crying.”

Ingrid stiffens and says dryly, “Oh, so you both cried together?”

It’s a tone of voice I’ve heard before—like a clap of thunder on a sunny
day, bringing with it a storm. She walks angrily out of the room, then
returns seconds later, bombarding me with questions: “Why did you
exchange numbers with her?” “What made you invite her here?” “And why
did she come while I was at work?”

Ingrid’s certain I had ulterior motives, which in this rare case I
didn’t. She listens testily as I explain this, then she utters the four
words that are the kiss of death to any relationship: “Show me your
phone.”

While Ingrid analyzes every word of my exchanges with Goulding, I look
at Hercules, who’s sleeping on his back on the bed. His shriveled little
organ hangs there, robbed of its function and purpose so he can be a
servant whose sole job is giving affection and unconditional acceptance
to his mistress. It seems wrong to rob any living thing of the joy of
sex.

When Ingrid finishes going through my phone, we spend half an hour
bickering about Goulding. This is the first time she’s accused me of
something I haven’t actually done and refused to believe the truth. And
it feels horrible: Not only is this a direct consequence of all the
times I have broken trust, but it can’t be easy dating someone who has
to work so hard not to cheat on her.

No woman wants a sex addict as a partner, except maybe a love addict.

Eventually Ingrid collapses on the bed next to Hercules and lapses into
sullen, tearful silence. For the first year of our relationship, she was
always smiling, laughing, and busy with creative projects. One of the
reasons I fell in love with her was that she cast a ray of sunshine that
penetrated even the darkest corners of my thoughts. But now her light
and creativity seem to have extinguished completely. She doesn’t even
speak to her friends anymore because they don’t approve of her dating
me.

As I look at the tear-wrecked mascara around Ingrid’s eyes, the deep
frown on her face, and the tragic fetal ball she forms around Hercules,
my mother’s warning echoes in my head: “Never grow up to make anyone as
miserable as your father makes me.”

When she steps into the car, wearing a red dress with her ever-present
black boots, I’m relieved to see her. Of all the professionals I’ve met,
she’s the only one who truly seems to see the tangled invisible strings
that guide human behavior.

And the first words out of Lorraine’s mouth not only shock me, but
they’re exactly what I need to hear right now. “We had a discussion when
you left rehab,” she says. “And we don’t think you’re a sex addict.”

“Really?”

“You have a sexual compulsivity and it’s one of many symptoms of your
upbringing.”

“Thank you.”

I’m not sure what the exact difference is between an addiction and a
compulsion, and I don’t care. Her words are the final bolt sliding open
and setting me free from all the shame, repression, and struggle of the
last year. It’s the best compliment anyone’s given me since I started
this whole process.

After my argument with Ingrid, I emailed Lorraine, who probably knows me
on a deeper level than anyone, to ask whether breaking up would be a
healthy decision for Ingrid and me or a mistake we’ll regret for the
rest of our lives. She replied that she was coming to town soon to run a
workshop in Orange County and we could discuss it in person then. So I
invited her to dinner with Rick and me.

When we enter the Italian restaurant Giorgio Baldi, we spot Rick sitting
alone in a white T-shirt. I’ve rarely seen him wear anything else. He
smiles and nods his head in gentle greeting as I introduce him to
Lorraine.

After we order, I let Rick know that I’m ready to throw in the towel on
this whole accept-everything-a-sex-addiction-expert-says idea. “It’s
been a year and I’m still not happy. I’ve followed everything to the
letter and I’ve learned a lot. But not only is my relationship hanging
by a thread right now, what hasn’t budged is my desire to be with other
people and my belief that I should.”

I study Rick’s face for a reaction. He takes it in and closes his eyes
lightly as if arriving at a thought—or, more accurately, letting a
thought arrive to him.

But before he can respond, Lorraine asks me, “Is that outside your value
system?”

“No.”

“Then I don’t see what’s wrong with it. After my husband died, I decided
I didn’t want to live with anyone again. I live alone and I’m happy, and
I wouldn’t want anyone in that space. And that’s what’s right for me.
What’s great about today is that there are many different options and
you can choose any one that’s true to you.”

I’m surprised to find her so open-minded. It sounds like she’s changed
her beliefs since rehab, so I ask her about it.

“Everything I told you during your chair work was true,” she says.
“However, Joan is the program director, and she has very strict
guidelines about condoning any sexual behavior outside of a committed
monogamous relationship, so I can’t always say everything that I think
there.”

“So you actually _do_ believe it’s possible to have intimacy outside of
monogamy?” I press, just to make sure I’m understanding her correctly.

“There are some couples who have a lifelong relationship and children,
and they agree to have an open marriage. As long as both people are
truthful and intimate and operating with integrity, I’m not going to
judge them.”

I look at the powder-dabbed wrinkles on her face, the folds of skin
threatening to pull down her neck, and the earned intelligence in her
eyes. And I think, Thank you for understanding.

I’m surprised by how much her approval means to me. Maybe it’s because
my permission to be a sexual being was taken away from me in rehab. It
was my punishment for abusing that right in my relationship, for harming
someone innocent with it. And now, after a year of probation, I’m
finally being granted provisional custody of it again.

“I feel like I’m ready to explore other relationship styles, but I’m a
little scared,” I tell Lorraine. “I’ve been waking up every morning this
week full of anxiety about losing Ingrid. I’m worried I won’t be able to
find this quality of love again and I’m ruining what may be my only
chance for a happy future and family.”

I’m so bad at commitment, I can’t even commit to being uncommitted.

Ambivalence. That’s my higher power. All hail Ambivalence, destroyer of
relationships.

Meanwhile, Rick sits in silence, listening to the conversation, nodding
and collecting thoughts.

“Have you asked Ingrid if she’s open to another type of relationship?”
Lorraine suggests as the food arrives.

“That would be the perfect solution. I just don’t think she’d be into
it, though.”

“You may be surprised,” she says.

Just as we have a family of origin that we’re stuck with, we can create
a family of choice that we freely select. And in some ways, it feels
like I’m sitting with the functional mother and father I’ve chosen.

This is when Rick finally opens his mouth to speak. “What I wish for
you,” he begins, measuring each word to make sure it lands as powerfully
as possible, “is that you commit all the way to living this adventurous
lifestyle you want, without any other option. Because you need to get to
the place where you have all the women you desire and find out it
doesn’t solve your loneliness or your need for connection or your pain.”

I’m shocked by the severity of his words. I thought we had an agreement
that I would try each path without judgment. “That wasn’t the way you
put it when we first discussed it.”

“Well, I had a little more hope for you then. But this seems to be what
you wanted all along.”

Lorraine watches him speak. I feel a mounting sense of anxiety that
she’s going to agree with him. “If you’re indeed going to follow through
with your decision,” she eventually says, arbitrating, “I’m going to ask
you to solve a mystery.”

“What’s the mystery?”

“The mystery is whether the path you’re embarking on is authentic or
you’re operating out of a wound.”

“How will I know the difference?”

“Wounds bring drama and trauma. They don’t bring comfort.” She pauses to
make sure I understand, then elaborates. “We all have six core needs:
emotional, social, intellectual, physical, sexual, and spiritual. And if
they’re being attended to and enhanced, then you’re doing the right
thing.”

“If this choice is coming from a healthy place, then you’ll find that it
leads to lasting happiness,” Rick adds. It seems less like he’s backing
down and more like he’s decided to let me learn for myself where this
path will lead.

“I hope it does,” I tell them. “Maybe I’ll be able to find someone who
shares my beliefs and values.”

As the words leave my lips, I worry that I’ll end up with the fate I
deserve: a woman who’s just like me.

“Remember,” Lorraine urges, as if reading my thoughts, “anything that
doesn’t bring you alive is too small for you.”

“And whatever you do,” Rick adds ominously, “I hope you do it cleanly
and honestly, with no baggage.”

“This is the best relationship I’ve ever had,” I tell her. “I’ve never
loved anyone so much.”

We are lying in our spare bedroom, which Ingrid decorated and named the
Spaceship Room. There are four mattresses pushed together on the floor
and black sheets covering the ceiling and windows. A projector plays
videos of galaxies on the wall, another beams constellations onto the
ceiling, and a light-up toy moon hangs over our heads. The room itself
is a testament to Ingrid’s playful creativity, and another reason I
admire her. Yet, nonetheless, I am about to break her heart. And mine.

“And that’s the problem,” I continue.

“The problem?”

I start to stutter. It’s hard for me to spit out the words that come
next. Tears well in her eyes. She knows what’s coming.

“I don’t want to lose you,” she says. Yet she knows she will.

We sit in silence for a moment, then she continues. “I feel like all our
problems lately have been my fault because I haven’t felt safe and
that’s made me distant and suspicious.”

I want to let her believe that, but it’s not the truth.

“No, it’s me,” I tell her. I feel horrible, I feel selfish, I feel
guilty, I feel defective. “I don’t know, but maybe we can try as an
experiment a less traditional type of relationship, just for a little
while, to get things out of my system.”

Who am I kidding? These things will never leave my system. I’ve tried.

“To get what out of your system?”

I take a deep breath. I start to shake. I’m nervous to say what comes
next. “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to earn back your trust.” Long
pause. “Because I don’t think it will ever feel right for me not to be
with anyone else. For the rest of my life.”

There. I said it. I look at her prismatic eyes, her high cheekbones, the
delicate double V of her neck and shoulder blades, and that intangible
quality of her soul that is more beautiful and enduring than all of it.
I don’t want her to have a body like that woman on the plane or to leave
me alone when she comes home from work or to stop reading over my
shoulder. I’m embarrassed that I ever had those thoughts. And I wonder:
Why is she not enough? Why can’t I just be happy with her? And my eyes
start to water.

She doesn’t get angry. She doesn’t break down crying. She looks me in
the eyes and says, tenderly, “Maybe you want to sleep with other people,
but I don’t want to do that. I can’t imagine having sex with someone I
don’t care about.”

“Maybe we could just take three months off and use the time to decide
what’s right in our heart.” As I’m making the suggestion, I know she’ll
never agree to it.

“If we stop, if we take a break, that’s it. We’re done. I will never see
you or talk to you again.” Her words are loving but firm, not the
dithering of an ambivalent.

This is it, then: I must make a decision. A lifetime of monogamy with
the woman I love. Or a lifetime of dating who I want, of doing what I
want, of having complete and total freedom. It doesn’t mean I’ll never
have a girlfriend or a child or a family. It just means I’ll have them
on my terms, not those of this repressive society that expects you to
cut off your balls as soon as you say “I do.”

I’m silent. I can’t do it. This is what I’ve been saying is so natural,
yet now I can’t bring myself to let go. We have a trip scheduled to
Machu Picchu in a couple of months, and countless other adventures we’ve
planned and imagined. I’ve spent my whole life dreaming of being with
someone like Ingrid: someone who I respect, who I trust, who I laugh
with constantly, who I wake up next to and look at and just smile,
grateful to the universe for bringing someone so lovely and loving into
my life. But . . .

The silence is more painful than words for her. The tears come now,
slowly. “You need to go on your quest,” she says. “And it’s one I can’t
go on with you. You have to go alone.”

“I don’t know. Is this ridiculous? We love each other so much. Are we
making a mistake?”

“No,” she says. “You have to do this . . . for you to be happy.”
Fortunately, one of us is strong.

“Do _you_ want to break up?”

“No. I’m doing this for you.”

And that’s when I lose it. I hug her, tears drenching our faces. “Thank
you for teaching me how to love and for teaching me what love is,” she
says. “You have the biggest heart of anyone I know.” I don’t believe
those words or even see how she can believe them. Yet she does.

We cling to each other in silence, until she says softly, “I wanted to
have babies with you.”

On the ceiling and walls, galaxies are in motion, tiny replicas of
planets and stars moving in their own orbits. And I think, We’re
changing the universe right now. This little decision is going to mean
those kids aren’t going to be born into this world. And we won’t be the
parents of cute little sunshine Ingrids and neurotic Neils.

A rumbling noise shakes the window, like an earthquake tremor or a
violent gust of wind, and I wonder if it’s a sign from the universe that
we’re making a mistake. Or maybe it’s Mexican _sicarios_ driving up to
kill me for working on that book about the drug war. Rick Rubin once
told me that on their deathbeds, people don’t think about their work or
their life experiences or the items remaining on their to-do list. They
think about love and family. And I’m throwing it away. I may genuinely
be turning that nightmare I had when I was a kid—of being a lazy, broke,
unloved deadbeat sleeping on the couch in my brother’s perfect suburban
family home—into a reality this time.

But do I actually want that dream: a house in the suburbs, a domestic
routine that never changes, a lifestyle where going out to a movie is
some sort of grand adventure, ungrateful kids like me who blame all
their problems on their parents? Maybe my heart isn’t as big as Ingrid
says it is. Or maybe it’s big, but only because it’s hungry and
constantly trying to consume more so it doesn’t starve.

I’m on the threshold of the freedom I’ve been fantasizing about for the
last year, yet now it feels like plunging off the edge of that rooftop
bar.

Ingrid strokes my head reassuringly and says, “I feel like I caught a
beautiful bird in the wild and put it in a cage, just for me to look
at.”

I listen. She knows. She understands me.

“The cage is near the window, and the bird keeps looking outside and
thinking about life out there. And I need to open the cage and let it
go, because it belongs in the wild.”

Then her face falls, her eyes redden, and the tears start coming faster.
I can’t let go, but she can. Between sobs, she sputters her last
thought, the six words that will haunt me forever after: “But birds die
in the wild.”

_I_’m free.

I can go wild. I can date any woman I want. I can text anyone anything
at any time. I can start searching for the ultimate free relationship.

But for some reason, that’s not what I’m doing. Instead, I’m relaxing in
solitude. I didn’t even know I’d missed myself.

I finished a book last night and I’m deep into another one this morning.
I haven’t read this much in years, or enjoyed it quite so much. The bed
feels clean and spacious, the sun warm and comforting, the Cinnamon
Toast Crunch soulful and decadent.

Rick says I’m going to eventually become one of those lonely old men who
yell at happy children. But I have my books to read. I have my warm bed.
And I have my breakfast cereals. As long as I have these, I will never
be alone.

Ingrid left with everything she owned in garbage bags two nights ago. It
was painful: Neither of us could stop crying. She left behind only a
ficus plant and a note:

_Thank you for letting me see your heart. You always said it was full of
darkness, but what I saw was bright and warm, full of life. It’s the
most beautiful thing, kind of like walking inside of a cave with a
candle and finding this amazing hidden treasure. I think that’s why you
have the treasure map engraved on you. You told me that your mom gave
away your goldfish when you were young because she said you couldn’t
take care of things. So I’m leaving my plant with you. I call it the
Survivor because when I got it, it went for months without water and
still kept growing. So now it’s yours, full of life, to prove you can
take care of things._

Her words pierce my most vulnerable organs: my heart and my shame core,
which I’m starting to think may be one and the same. Love is so hard to
find as it is, it’s insane to tell someone to stop loving you—for
possibly no good reason. Especially someone as genuine and caring as
Ingrid. But that’s what I did.

I feel loneliness at times, sadness occasionally, and a hovering sense
of doom without Ingrid, as well as guilt for subjecting her to all my
doubt, resentment, and struggle for nothing. But, still, I’m happier
alone. Just me and the Survivor. At least the Survivor will let me water
other plants.

I flip the card over to find a postscript: “Please do not reply to this
and do not call me. I will be trying to heal. If you ever need to reach
me in an emergency, your code word is ‘Freeeeeeedom!’ You may only use
it once and I will be there for you.”

I wander into the kitchen to drop my dirty cereal bowl in the sink. I
don’t clean it. I don’t brush my teeth. I didn’t even shower or wash my
face this morning.

I load a surfboard into my Durango and drive to the beach. The sun is
blazing, the mountain view is majestic, and the waves are clean. I feel
guilty for enjoying it all. Perhaps the people who hurt you the most
when they leave are the ones you shouldn’t have been with anyway,
because they do it without compassion. Ingrid left with nothing but
compassion.

When I return home, I change into jeans and a thin hoodie. On the
kitchen counter, I see _Silently Seduced_ staring me in the face. I flip
through it and read some of the passages I underlined: “Make a full
commitment to stay in your relationship if you judge it to be good for
you,” Adams writes. “Separate the insatiable needs of the inner child
from the realistic intimacy needs of the adult. Regrettably, all the
developmental needs lost to the incestuous relationship will not be met
fully in any one partnership.”

I panic for a moment, worried that I’ve made a horrible mistake, that my
grounded adolescent has broken up with Ingrid’s abandoned child. But
then I think that if my needs can’t ever be met by one partnership
anyway, then I’m definitely doing the right thing by trying to get them
met through multiple partnerships. Maybe the damage is irreparable and I
just need to find a way to live with it, to make friends with it, to
embrace the shadow rather than fighting it.

When the sun sets, I drive to the market to pick up a quarter pound of
pulled pork and some coleslaw. As I sit at home, eating out of the
plastic containers and watching movie trailers online, I feel a sense of
inner peace I can’t remember having had in a long time. I can move in
any direction I want without anyone stopping me, holding me back, being
hurt by it, or even just asking where I’m going or to wait for her.

I thought for sure by now I’d be calling someone to spend the night
with, just so I could feel a new body pressed against mine and
extinguish the solitude. But instead I’m enjoying being me again. Either
I’d lost myself and wasn’t really taking care of my needs in the
relationship as I thought I was. Or it’s not actually Ingrid I feel
freed from, but the incessant guilt and repression of the sex addiction
world.

As I lie in bed that night reading _Zorba the Greek_ (“the backside of
the miller’s wife, that’s human reason,” the eponymous character
remarks), my mind keeps turning to Ingrid and replaying things she used
to say and do. Like the way she used to pull down my pants and yell
“Freedom!” and try to push me out the door. Or the way she’d buy
ridiculously flavored drinks like bacon soda or sweet corn soda, and
present them to me like a ring announcer introducing boxers. Or the way
she’d try to keep me from entering our bedroom, claiming to be a bouncer
and demanding to see my VIP pass. I miss my best friend.

I once asked Dave Navarro, a rock guitarist I wrote a book with, why he
was sabotaging his marriage to Carmen Electra, who at the time was one
of the world’s biggest sex symbols. “It’s like living with my best
friend,” he complained. And I responded, “That sounds great. Who
wouldn’t want to live with their best friend all their life?” Now I know
the answer: When you live with your best friend, your dick gets lonely.

Linda, a girl I dated in the past, calls. It’s as if she has a radar or,
more likely, is stalking me online. I was Linda’s first, and whenever
we’re between relationships—and occasionally when we’re not—we hook up.
When I tell her that I broke up with Ingrid, she replies kittenishly,
“Good, now you can have a baby with me.”

“Maybe we can do that someday. But I don’t want to be monogamous.”

I wonder why I feel like I can’t handle marriage, but I can handle
fatherhood. I think this is because it’s not the responsibility I mind,
it’s the exclusivity. You can raise a child and still have one or two or
ten other children. And growing apart and separating is the nature of
that relationship, so over time everyone gains more freedom.

Linda and I talk about how the arrangement would work in a way that’s
healthy for the child, but ultimately it’s just a role-playing fantasy.
Especially since she has a boyfriend, so I have no idea why she’s
calling me. All I know is that I don’t have to feel guilty for taking
the call.

I close my eyes and sink back into the comfort of my bed, ready to wake
to another limitless day, free to spread out in whatever direction I
choose. Any reality can be mine. I can have a baby with someone like
Linda. I can create a free-love commune like Father Yod. I can find a
relationship that’s boundless and limitless. I can be true to myself.

And perhaps this is freedom: standing in a circular room surrounded by
open doors, knowing that I can walk through any of them, and
anticipating the new adventure that lies beyond each one.

I may miss Ingrid, but I’m ready.

Entry from Ingrid’s Journal

DAY 1

_1:00 p.m._

Hercules and I went to the dog park together. I feel weird and strange,
sort of shy when talking to guys who approach me. I feel like I’m in a
brand-new world. So far I haven’t really thought much about Neil.
Waiting for the night to come. It’s the night that scares me.

Everyone at the dog park thinks Hercules is a sweetie pie. He mostly
keeps to himself and likes to smell the grass.

I feel very sensitive. I don’t want people to approach me or talk to me.
I want to be alone. I feel lonely and sad.

_9:00 p.m._

Waiting outside [my friend] Melissa’s house. Meeting her for a drink. I
need to ask her how she got over her breakup. On my way back to the
office from the dog park, I stopped at Rocket Fizz for some fun flavored
sodas. But every flavor reminded me of Neil because we tried practically
every soda there. I found a few new flavors, but then I thought, Hmm, if
it’s good, I’d want to share it with him. So I just left without buying
anything.

I miss my best friend. My family. My everything.

Can I do this?

When is Melissa coming out? Gad! Been out here for more than thirty
minutes.

The moon is shining bright tonight. The moon is caressing me with its
gentle light. I hope Neil is outside so the moon can touch us both and
connect us with its light.

I love him. No doubt.

At a bar with Melissa now. She’s talking to some guy she knows. He wants
to introduce me to the bartender.

3

Charles is upset because his wife got mad at him all over again, locked
him out of the house, and told his family that he’d cheated on her with
prostitutes. Adam has stopped playing soccer, yet his wife still isn’t
thawing. A haggard rock guitarist named Rod confesses that he’s been
going to Asian massage parlors behind his wife’s back.

And everyone is yelling at me.

This is my last group therapy session, and Sheila wants them to
“process” my departure. The previous week, they did the same with
Calvin, who left the group after deciding to bring Mariana and his son
to Los Angeles for a long stay to see if they could make it as a family
together.

“So what are you going to do now?” Charles asks me, as if life without
sex addiction treatment is inconceivable.

“What I want to do is take some time to explore different alternative
relationships, so I can find the one that’s right for me.”

“What do you mean by alternative relationships?” Adam asks, perplexed.
He seems to have no idea that there are options in life besides
monogamous marriage.

“I wrote down some criteria for the type of relationship I’m looking
for.” I pull out my phone and read a note I jotted the night before:

               1.  It can’t be sexually exclusive, which rules out
monogamy.

               2.  It has to be honest, which rules out adultery.

               3.  It has to be capable of developing romantic and
emotional attachment, which rules out being a permanent bachelor.

               4.  It has to be capable of evolving into a family with
healthy, well-adjusted children, which rules out unstable partners and
lifestyles.

There’s an awkward silence when I finish. Finally, Charles speaks: “I
had hope that you’d be the two-cars-in-the-garage addict, who gets
treatment and recovers before he’s lost everything.” He shakes his head
in disappointment. His Alfred Nobel has turned out to be a Robert
Oppenheimer. “But now it looks like you’re going to have to hit bottom.”

“You have a sickness in your brain!” a construction manager in the group
yells, like a priest from the Middle Ages telling me I’m possessed by
the devil. He’s here because his wife caught him draining their bank
account to pay for time with webcam girls. “You’re not capable of
deciding anything for yourself. Your head got you into this mess, so how
do you think that same head is gonna get you out of it?”

I start to defend myself, but Sheila raises a hand to shush me. “Listen
to everyone’s feedback first,” she instructs.

Rod is up next. “Some of my friends have tried open relationships,” he
begins. “And they don’t work. It’s natural for you to want one because
you’re a male and you’re an addict. But no normal woman is going to date
you if you tell her you can’t be faithful, except someone who’s so weak
she’ll accept that.”

But who decides what’s natural and normal, I wonder? What if it’s simply
the cultural pressure women constantly receive about being a good girl,
saving their virginity, and finding _the one,_ combined with a
preponderance of abandoning fathers creating clingy love addicts, that
people misinterpret as an inherent female disposition toward
happily-ever-after monogamy? I’m starting to believe that the whole
notion of classifying certain behaviors as normal and abnormal hurts
people more than it helps them.

When everyone’s finished condemning me, Sheila takes a few deep breaths,
her upturned palms rising and falling with each aspiration, until she’s
slowed the energy in the room. Then, in as loving a voice as she can
muster, she condemns me: “You’re in relapse right now. What you’re doing
is making plans to avoid the emotional pain of the breakup and the pain
of knowing you can’t give Ingrid what she needs in a relationship.”

I sit there trying to make sense of what she’s saying, but it appears to
be complete nonsense. Fortunately, Adam, who seems to be grasping the
concept of an alternative relationship, comes to the rescue, “Let’s face
it: What Neil wanted is not what Ingrid’s about. He was honest with her
and that’s a huge step forward. I don’t know if any of us has been that
honest with our wives. At least he’s figuring all this out before he
gets married.”

“Can’t you see, Adam, that this is his eroticized rage?” Sheila
admonishes him.

I want to say that using the term _eroticized rage_ as a blanket
condemnation of all nonmonogamy and casual sex is an act of rage in
itself, an attempt to shame anyone who doesn’t share her personal views
and morals. She could just as easily pathologize my writing, dismiss it
as a trauma reaction to feeling misunderstood as a child, and tell me
that to be intimate I need to have two-way communication and go through
a twelve-step program to stop this solitary form of conversational
masturbation.

But I keep my mouth shut—until Sheila gives me permission to respond and
say farewell at the end of the session. At first I want to ask why no
one’s coming down on Rod for going to massage parlors, but when I look
at him slumped pathetically in his chair, I understand the answer: He
admits he has a sickness he’s powerless over, whereas I still don’t
believe the sickness exists for most of us and am about to set off on an
exploration of extra-relational sex. So if I don’t end up either dead or
in some way destroyed, that would threaten everyone’s belief in this
quasi-religion and thus their tenuous control over their desires.

So I fight back my rebuttal, which would only validate Sheila’s rage
accusation, and simply thank them and tell them to stay in touch. But
when she gives me her sad-Sheila look and says she’s hurting for me, it
gets a little harder to stick to the high road. “Don’t worry about me,”
I tell her. “That’s your own pain and sadness you’re feeling, not mine.
I’m fine.”

Fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and . . . enlightened. Because I’m done
sitting here with these spineless men, most of whom don’t even enjoy the
marriages they’re struggling so hard to save.

We’ve been living in the dark ages of relationships. It was the Catholic
Church that began a relentless campaign to make monogamy and lifelong
marriages inviolable institutions in the ninth century. It’s time to
enter an enlightened age of love, sexuality, and attachment. Someone has
to undo the padlock that society has put on our genitals—even if it
means getting burned at the stake by Sheila, Charles, Joan, Patrick
Carnes, and millions of others who are terrified of change, freedom,
and, ultimately, pleasure.

So goodbye sex addiction group, hello group sex.

DAY 4

I always get emotionally abandoned. My dad left and so does every man in
my life. I thought earlier, Guys are jerks. Then I corrected myself and
thought, Well, I pick them, so I’m a jerk.

I don’t want to be a jerk anymore. I’m so hurt my heart is numb. Neil
doesn’t want me and he’s probably happy he’s not with me.

I try to forget so it doesn’t hurt. One day at a time. Tomorrow is
another day with a little less pain. I’ll be okay. There’s a light that
follows me and makes sure I’m okay.

Neil forgot me this soon? I haven’t forgotten him.

I don’t want him to know he hurt me. He let me go.

I told you I was the villain in this story.

Beer cans and plastic bags crunch under the tires as I park near the
address Shama Helena gave me. Rows of small mismatched homes line the
street, each with its own dying lawn. The more affluent residents are
distinguishable by low metal gates separating their property from their
neighbors’.

The house I’m looking for is a one-story yellow stucco affair. Behind
it, there’s a garage and a garden shed, each leased as an apartment. I
am here to see the tenant living in the garage.

It’s not the best neighborhood in the Valley. And I’m not sure if I’m
doing the right thing by coming here. But I have to start somewhere. So
why not with Shama Helena?

The first place I started looking for monogamy alternatives after my
last group therapy session was the online polyamory community. Where
polygamy historically refers to someone married to multiple people
simultaneously—polyandry if it’s a woman with multiple men, polygyny if
it’s a man with multiple women—polyamory is a more recent and much more
broad term meaning “many loves.” It was coined in the early nineties by
Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart, a New Age writer whose name pretty much
embodies the post-hippieness of the original poly community. Her
neologism spread quickly because, among other reasons, it’s far more
graceful than saying “pluralistic relationships” or “multiple-partner
relating.”

While searching online for local polyamory meet-up groups, I stumbled
across Shama Helena’s name. In addition to leading one of the groups,
she also self-published a book called _Polyamory 101_ and coaches
newcomers to the alternative relationship world. So I contacted her to
discuss my options and the best places to find open-minded partners.

I knock softly on the door of Shama Helena’s garage, excited to begin my
journey into the world of alternative relationships and find my
nonmonogamous one—or ones. Evidently, judging by her place of business,
teaching people to have more lovers doesn’t pay as well as teaching them
to have fewer.

Shama Helena greets me in loose-fitting drawstring pants and a tank top
with massive cleavage thrusting out of it. She appears to be in her
fifties, with auburn hair, long bangs, and a compellingly witchy face_,_
but with a nose that’s broad rather than sharp. Common sense tells me to
leave; curiosity drives me forward.

The garage has been converted into two rooms. The busty witch of the
Central Valley leads me to the back one, in which a bed has been
squeezed lengthwise between the walls. She sits cross-legged at the head
of the mattress. This is her office.

Apparently I’m supposed to sit opposite her at the foot of the bed. I
wonder what kind of woman would let a stranger, who contacted her off
the Internet, into her home and onto her bed within seconds. Then I
realize that’s exactly the kind of woman I’ve come here looking for.

In the sixteenth century, a woman like Shama Helena would probably have
been burned at the stake—not necessarily because of the way she looks or
the candles, incense, and red draperies strewn throughout the house, but
because women who were overtly sexual were thought to be witches
possessed by the devil. We’ve come a long way as a culture in five
hundred years. Now, instead of calling them witches and killing them, we
call them sluts and kill their reputations.

Men have a conflicted relationship with female sexuality: When a man is
single, he wants women to be as easy and undiscerning as porn stars. But
at the same time he’s terrified by this behavior, because he thinks if a
woman sleeps with _him_ so easily, then clearly she’ll sleep with
_anybody_ and thus won’t be faithful in a relationship. We have so many
contradictory, repressive, self-limiting beliefs about sexuality—and
almost every one of them stems from a pathological need to dictate to
someone else what they are and aren’t allowed to do with their body and
heart.

“So what can I help you with?” Shama Helena asks.

I start to tell her my story, but as I’m talking, something starts to
collapse inside me. I pause and close my eyes to strengthen the walls of
my heart, and Shama Helena the all-seeing catches me.

“What’s wrong?” she asks.

I suck in a lungful of incense-laden air. “I was thinking about Ingrid,
my ex.” It feels weird to call her my ex, as if she’s been crossed out
of my life. “We booked this trip to Machu Picchu together, and I just
got sad thinking of going without her.”

In a slow voice that’s a little too breathy, as if she’s studied Marilyn
Monroe singing “Happy Birthday” to John F. Kennedy, she tells me that
she believes there are three types of men: til-death-do-us-part guys who
want to be with one person for the rest of their lives; Peter Pan types
who never want to grow up and just want to accumulate notches on their
belt; and mature men who want to have intimate relationships with
multiple partners.

As I listen to her, feeling like a combination of all three types, I
start imagining what her sex life must be like. I see her naked,
wrinkles everywhere, tits hanging down her chest, and with a huge
radiant smile, being groped by guys with gray chest hair and with torsos
like an expanse of hills. For some reason, the scene isn’t disgusting;
it seems joyful.

Shama Helena rises and walks to a hot plate on a shelf a few feet
away—presumably her kitchen—to pour a cup of tea for herself. She offers
me some, but I worry that it might have an aphrodisiac in it, so I pass.

When she returns to the bed—presumably her dining table as well—I ask
about the most common types of polyamory. From her long response, I
manage to piece together these three relationship structures:

               1.  Having a primary partner, with each person free to
negotiate or enter into separate secondary and tertiary relationships.

               2.  Creating a triad, in which three people are
romantically involved. This can take the form of three people in an
equal relationship (a “triangle”); one person simultaneously dating two
others who are not as close to each other (a “V”); or a couple sharing
the same secondary (which she doesn’t name but I suppose would be a
“T”).

               3.  Forming a group relationship of four or more people.

“Where would swinging fall into this?” I ask.

She grimaces like she’s just tongued down a bleeding hemorrhoid. “The
swinger lifestyle is just ‘let’s fuck.’ The poly lifestyle is ‘I’d like
to get to know you.’”

I suppose if polyamory were all about sex, it would be called polycoitus
instead. In the lecture that follows, Shama Helena explains that to most
people, polyamory means having multiple loving romantic relationships in
which all the partners know about one another. The key word here is
_loving._ A relationship that permits only casual sex on the side
wouldn’t technically qualify. The other distinction is honesty. Having a
secret mistress or being in a “don’t ask, don’t tell” relationship
wouldn’t truly be polyamorous either. And poly doesn’t necessarily come
with freedom. Many relationships, Shama Helena explains, require sexual
exclusivity to some or all members of the group—or, as it’s called,
_polyfidelity_.

“Whatever the situation may be, what you want is a bonded partnership
that gives you a foundation to fly,” she tells me. “There’s a concept
called _compersion_. And that means if your partner has another lover,
rather than being jealous, you’re happy for her because she’s happy.”

Suddenly, reality sinks in. If I can do what I want, then of course
whoever I date should likewise be free to do what she wants. And how am
I going to feel if I’m home alone working while she’s spending the night
at some lover’s house—or a long weekend at a five-star tropical resort
with some dashing Romeo trained in the arts of the Kama Sutra?

Traditionally, adultery has been a privilege chiefly reserved for men.
Anthropologist Gwen Broude researched 112 different societies and found
that 56 percent permitted extramarital sex for husbands, whereas only 12
percent allowed it for women. Even in the Bible, and in societies today
where they bury people up to their necks and stone them to death, it’s
typically adulterous women (and often their lovers) who are are
punished, rarely married men who cheat with single women.

However, liberation for only one person in a relationship isn’t truly
freedom; it’s totalitarianism. So I’ll have to learn to let go and suck
it up.

“What if compersion isn’t an emotion that comes naturally to me?”

“Like anything, it takes work,” Shama Helena responds, arching her back.
Despite her witchiness, the display arouses me. The incense must be
going to my head. Good thing I didn’t drink the tea. “In order to truly
be polyamorous, you’re going to have to go through the path of
uncomfortability. Just know that you’re going to experience jealousy,
and know that it’s about you, not her. So allow yourself to be
vulnerable. Don’t be afraid to show your feelings and needs, and work
through them. In the end, you’ll find that true love is wanting your
partner to have whatever she wants—whether or not you approve of it.”

I inhale cautiously. It’s excellent advice. And I think I can do this. I
imagine Ingrid having sex with someone else, and I guess as long as I
knew I was her primary, I could eventually learn to deal with whatever
feelings came up. Maybe it would even inspire me to be better in bed
instead of being lazy and fantasizing about other women.

There are just a few minutes left in the session. And I have two burning
questions I still need help with. In my most challenging times with
Ingrid, an image kept coming back to me: the picture of Father Yod
living with all his happy hippie lovers.

So I ask: “What if I want to create a community of people living
together in a single open relationship?”

I win big points with Shama Helena for this question. It’s her dream
also. She says she wants to get some property and have everyone in her
“tribe” live there in different houses. I try to imagine her renting all
the garages in the neighborhood.

Question two: “How do I know which type of relationship is right for
me?”

She recommends dipping my toe in the water by going to the annual World
Polyamory Association Conference, which she describes as the biggest and
most established event in the community. “Take your time before deciding
what relationship style is right for you,” she adds. “Explore the
different options this world has to offer first. See some good modeling
and see some bad modeling. Stay on the outside and be in a place of
inquiry, but notice what you gravitate toward.”

As we wrap up our session, I feel energized and optimistic, with a
better grasp on how to move forward and what to look for.

However, as I slide off the bed and make my way out of her lair, Shama
Helena slowly raises her hand and points a crooked finger at me: “One
more thing.” The breathiness is gone. Her voice is stern. I worry for a
moment that she’s going to turn me into a toad or a dildo or something.
“You need to be upfront with everyone you meet. Because if you date a
monogamous woman, she’s going to want to be in a monogamous
relationship. It’s not fair to her. So if you’re serious about this, I
want you to promise me you won’t have any monogamous partners.”

That massively narrows the playing field. It would rule out all of my
past partners, not to mention most of the population of North America.
However, if that crazy cannibal in Germany could find someone willing to
be eaten alive, I can at least find a few women who will let me date
other people. So . . .

“I promise.”

“Good. You need to find someone in the paradigm. For example, I’m a
Tantrika and I don’t date anyone who’s not Tantric.”

So she _is_ a witch, I think as I give her fifty dollars for, as she
puts it, “an offering.” I’ve never trusted people who mix spirituality
with business, and I’m not sure if Shama Helena is an exception to that
rule. But for my first small venture into the world of polyamory, it
wasn’t too bad. I’m looking forward to taking her advice and, for
starters, searching the World Polyamory Association Conference for
potential new partners.

As I walk out and make my way back down the path, Shama Helena asks when
I’m going to Machu Picchu. “Next month,” I tell her, imagining all the
fit poly yoga women I’ll be meeting at the conference. Younger versions
of Shama Helena.

But then she calls out after me: “Let me know if you have any ET
experiences in Peru!”

And something inside me plummets. I think it’s hope. Perhaps Rod’s
right: Expecting to find sane women in this community may be
unrealistic. They’re like benevolent extraterrestrials, guardian angels,
and Norse gods—imaginary creatures, products of fantasy, symptoms of a
longing not to be alone in the universe.

Entry from Ingrid’s Journal

DAY 7

I feel much better.

8

At home the next day, I register for the World Polyamory Association
Conference, which falls on the same dates I was supposed to be in Peru,
so I push the trip back. Then I order a stack of books from Amazon, the
classics in the field of consensual nonmonogamy—_The Ethical Slut,
Opening Up, Sex at Dawn, Polyamory: The New Love Without Limits—_as well
as a lesser-known book from a more therapeutic perspective, _Love in
Abundance: A Counselor’s Advice on Open Relationships,_ by Kathy
Labriola. I speak with her briefly, and she explains that she believes
“multiple-partner relating is as fixed a sexual orientation as being
straight or gay.”

Since I have a month until the polyamory conference, I do something that
I’ve been repressing for the last year. I re-engage with the women who
were texting and emailing during my relationship with Ingrid. Even
though Ingrid and I are no longer dating, I still feel like I’m somehow
betraying her.

Unfortunately, my first dating experiences go _too_ well. I take a trip
to spend time with Raidne, the augmented Las Vegan who emailed me after
I returned from rehab. But after just two nights together, she asks,
“Are you sleeping with anyone else?” It’s evident from her tone of voice
that this is not an innocent question but an ultimatum.

So I very clearly and compassionately explain to her, “When I hear your
question, it sounds like you believe that an experience with someone
else would detract from whatever we’re developing together. But wouldn’t
it be better to just allow this relationship to set its own course
without trying to control it or limit each other? Sexual exclusivity
shouldn’t be a criteria for deciding whether to care about someone or
not.”

Raidne listens closely, blinking her false eyelashes, taking in every
word and weighing its meaning carefully. Then she responds bluntly: “I’m
not that kind of girl.”

Bright monogamous apple, wrong orchard.

A week later, Elizabeth, the entrepreneur who wanted to distract me on
Skype when I was dating Ingrid, invites me to a business dinner she’s
having with investors. Afterward, we end up making out in her apartment.
She sucks my finger into her mouth, then reaches down my pants.
Suddenly, however, she disentangles herself and says, “I’m so attracted
to you. But I have a son. And if I have sex with you, you have to marry
me.”

Her words shock me: as if sex is something to barter with in exchange
for commitment, as if love is a business agreement to be negotiated and
notarized, as if her pussy is a fucking startup and my dick is the angel
investor who’s going to fund it. Even more shocking, she’s already in a
long-term relationship with a high-profile lawyer. Maybe she’s planning
to jump ship. There’s a term called hypergamy, which is when people
marry someone of higher status, so I suppose this would be hypogamy.

As I drive home, dispirited, I realize I’ve already made my first
mistakes. Monogamous relationships are waiting in the shallow end of the
dating world like fishing nets. Just one wrong move, and I’ll get
tangled up again. And to break up with Ingrid just to end up in another
exclusive relationship would not only be a travesty, but neither
Elizabeth nor Raidne, despite all their positive attributes, has even a
fraction of the quality of heart, sense of humor, or joy of life that
Ingrid has. Shama Helena was right. You can’t just date people randomly
and then hope to slowly ease them into a nonmonogamous relationship. You
have to be upfront from the beginning.

I spend the rest of the week looking through my options and eliminating
everyone who’s monogamous, already dating someone, or clearly not
relationship material, leaving three strong possibilities. There’s
Violet, a bisexual writer with whom I’ve had many sexual adventures; but
when I call her, she tells me she’s currently experimenting with
monogamy.

There’s Anne, the French woman who emailed nude photos while I was with
Ingrid. She’s a healer and acupuncturist, and her social media posts
suggest an alternative lifestyle. So I start talking to her and
eventually make plans to visit after the polyamory conference.

And then there’s Belle, the Australian coquette who kept texting while I
was with Ingrid. When I met Belle, I brought her and a cute skater girl
back to my hotel room to spend the night, so she’s clearly
nonmonogamous.

“Remember that night?” I ask when I call her. She giggles; she
remembers. After a little small talk, I continue: “I don’t know if
you’re familiar with polyamory, but it’s the idea that love is not some
kind of scarce resource that can flow only into a single person.”

I pause and wait for a well-reasoned objection or verbal tirade. When
she says nothing, I elaborate, babbling nervously. “Just as a person can
love parents, children, pets, and all kinds of songs and movies at the
same time, so too can they love different partners without the emotions
for one detracting from the emotions for the other. So I’m—”

Finally she speaks, mercifully interrupting me. “You want to put
together a harem, don’t you, Mr. Strauss?”

I hadn’t quite thought of it that way. I think Father Yod lived with men
and women, each with their own husbands and wives. But who doesn’t want
a harem? And there’s a lilt to Belle’s voice. It’s flirtatious and she
hasn’t hung up or said I’m a monster. These are good signs.

The last thing I want, however, is some kind of cult or patriarchal
Mormon household. So I explain, “A harem, to me, is a bunch of women
controlled by a guy. I’d rather live in a group atmosphere of learning
and growth where everyone’s equal and free.”

“Who are these other women you want to live with?” Suddenly the lilt
changes to a sharp, suspicious minor key. Behind every _yes_, there’s
always a _no_ waiting to ruin all the fun.

“I don’t know yet. But if you were interested in maybe joining me on
this exploration, I’ll make sure they’re cool people we’d both get along
with.”

Somehow the word _exploration_ seems safer than _relationship_. Less
commitment, easier for her to back out of. And we don’t really know each
other all that well yet. But at least I’m being upfront this time.

“I’m not sure what you’re up to, Mr. Strauss, but I trust it will be
interesting.” The lilt is back. That wasn’t too difficult. If I can just
get a few more women to say yes, I’m going to be living a fantasy that
as an adolescent I didn’t even dream was possible. I thought it would
take years to put together something like Father Yod’s group
relationship.

“How soon can you get here?” I ask.

“I have some time off in three months.”

“I’ll see you then.”

Now I’m committed.

And in over my head already.

Fortunately, I have time to learn to swim. The World Polyamory
Association Conference is happening soon. And there I can find not just
the tools to make this work, but like-minded people with knowledge,
experience, and, hopefully, an interest in joining me. Because if
monogamy isn’t natural and cheating isn’t moral, then the people there
must be the bravest, most ethical, and most enlightened beings in the
relationship world.

“My name is Sasha,” he says.

Then he strips naked and runs around the interior of a circle of men.
Afterward, the guys standing there—most of them gray-haired,
loose-skinned, and pale—strip off their ill-fitting clothing and traipse
into the center. There are man-tits, saggy asses, and swinging penises
everywhere.

The only person still wearing clothes, holding fast as the last
representative of the collapsed circle, is me. I thought the World
Polyamory Association Conference was going to be a well-organized
networking, lecture, and workshop event that would teach me about
managing nonmonogamous relationships and living with multiple partners.
Instead, I’m in a latter-day-hippie nudist resort called Harbin Hot
Springs, surrounded by excessively happy naked men whom I can’t imagine
functioning effectively in the outside world. That said, at least
they’re free. Really, really free.

To kick off the conference, we separated into a men’s circle and a
women’s circle. Then each attendee was asked to introduce himself and
make a gesture for everyone else to imitate. One guy twirled. Another
waved. I bowed. And good old Sasha—an energetic seventy-year-old with an
infectious grin and deep-set smile lines—just had to strip naked.

Sasha also happens to be one of the founders of the World Polyamory
Association along with his wife, Janet, who later explains that
polyamory was a gift given to our civilization by aliens from the planet
Nibiru. I’m reminded, fretfully, of Shama Helena’s parting words. Is the
idea of polyamory so far out that only people who believe in aliens can
grok it?

Perhaps the connection comes from the classic science fiction book
_Stranger in a Strange Land,_ in which a man born on Mars comes to earth
and starts a free-love cult. “The code says, ‘Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbor’s wife,’” author Robert A. Heinlein wrote in 1961. “The result?
Reluctant chastity, adultery, jealousy, bitterness, blows and sometimes
murder, broken homes, and twisted children. . . . There is no need for
you to covet my wife—love her! There’s no limit to her love.”

After the welcome circle, a gray-haired woman with an extremely soft
voice—they seem to think here that speaking quietly means being
spiritual—leads the group through an exercise in which we create an
energy field around ourselves and a partner tries to sense it and walk
into it. So far, none of this appears to have anything to do with
polyamory.

“Do you need a partner?” a voice booms.

I look up and see a tall naked bearded man hovering over me. He seems
creepy. In fact, there’s nothing a naked guy could say to me right now
that wouldn’t seem creepy. Especially when he looks like a pot-bellied
Abraham Lincoln. I take a step back and tell him I’m passing on this
one.

I find an inconspicuous spot against the wall and press myself against
it. Nearby, a large middle-aged woman is lying on her stomach, gravity
flattening her excess deposits against the carpet. An extremely pale
manchild with curly hair, who appears to be twenty years her junior and
a hundred twenty pounds her inferior, lies beside her in a toga, his
package dangling outside the sheet as he massages the meat of her
shoulders.

The polys end the morning session by performing a contact dance. They
roll around the floor like logs—crossing, colliding, and touching,
touching, touching. I’m not sure I’d want to do this even with people I
was attracted to.

I broke up with Ingrid for this?

So far, the conference seems more like bisexual New Age softcore
swinging than polyamory.

When Sasha announces a lunch break, I dash to the buffet. I figure if
I’m first in the food line, no one’s pubic hair will end up in my veggie
burger. I load my plate, then find a seat at an outdoor picnic bench.
Just next to it, there’s a hot tub in which a smiling nude woman is
floating on her back, rapturously exposing herself to the sun’s rays.

Naked Abraham Lincoln sits next to me and strikes up a conversation. He
tells me he was recently widowed. It seems odd that the first thing he
does after she dies is go to a polyamory conference to play log jam with
a bunch of strangers, but then again that’s what I did as soon as Ingrid
and I broke up. He is the future me.

We’re soon joined by a couple who introduce themselves as Martin and
Diana. Martin is a tan, muscular painter from France; his wife, Diana,
is a Latin woman with enormous natural breasts. She says she wishes her
husband wasn’t poly, but she accepts it and has her own secondary.
However, she adds, shooting him a look, “I’d give it all up in a second
if my husband decided to be monogamous.”

A shy couple from Sacramento sits next to them. The man wants to open
up, but his wife has reservations. These relationships sound like the
exact opposite of the marriages in rehab: Instead of a wife expecting
monogamy from a husband who doesn’t like it, the man is expecting
nonmonogamy from a woman not comfortable with it. Perhaps the women here
are simply less stubborn versions of Ingrid, the men more strong-minded
versions of me. I wonder how a wife would cheat in this inverse
relationship: by _not_ sleeping with anyone else?

Lincoln tells me that this used to be a big conference with nearly two
hundred attendees, but one of the main volunteers stepped down. She had
three lovers and was in danger of losing custody of her children because
of her lifestyle, so she had to start acting more monogamous.

His story is disheartening: If anyone who has more than one partner is
seen by the government as immoral and unsuitable as a parent, then this
revolution has much bigger enemies to fight than the sex addiction
industry.

We’re interrupted by a naked rabbi who lives on a poly kibbutz in Israel
and is in some way dating the woman who’s either sleeping, dead, or
meditating in the hot tub. He stands up, pours a glass of wine, and
sings a prayer over it in a deep, beautiful voice as his dick swings in
the air like a metronome.

It is in these moments that I miss Ingrid most. Loneliness is holding in
a joke because you have no one to share it with.

After lunch, we return to the conference area. A few more attendees have
arrived and I scan them, hoping to find a woman I’m attracted to. But
even with my low standards, I see only one person: a short, curvy blond
nerd with thick black glasses.

The next speaker, a relationship coach with long silver hair named Scott
Catamas, teaches something called _the four adjustments_. To make
relationships healthy and harmonious, he tells the assembled polys, it’s
necessary to:

               1.  Turn judgment into compassion and acceptance.

               2.  Transform shame into reassurance.

               3.  Change criticism to appreciation.

               4.  Replace blame with understanding.

It’s the first piece of useful information I’ve gotten here so far, and
reminiscent of the principles of functional adult behavior that Lorraine
taught in rehab. Later, I notice a group of polys sitting in a circle
and passing a talking stick, discussing being their authentic selves and
yelling “Aho!” Maybe all these people are also sex addiction rehab
refugees.

Just when I’m about to dismiss the conference as a waste of time, a pack
of eight people bursts through the door. They’re comparatively young,
they’re generally fit, they’re reasonably attractive, and they’re
clustered around a rail-thin woman like she’s their Father Yod. She has
an angular face and a bob haircut. From one vantage point, she looks
cute; from another, she looks severe; from yet another, she looks like a
man.

“Who’s that?” I ask Honest Abe.

“That’s Kamala Devi. She’s really big. She has a four-thousand-person
mailing list,” he says with awe.

Kamala walks to the front of the room and greets the admiring throng
with a “Namaste,” pressing her palms together and holding them over her
head and then her heart as her admiring pod gathers around her. Everyone
I’ve met so far came here either alone or as a couple. This group of men
without shirts and women in half-tops and yoga pants is actually the
first poly constellation I’ve seen so far—and, unlike the couples I had
lunch with, the woman is in charge and clearly into it.

Kamala stands with perfect yoga poise in front of the room, her hair
parted high off her forehead, her skin so taut that every contour of her
skull seems visible. She begins her talk by leading conference attendees
in a chant of _om_. Afterward, she introduces herself as a “goddess” and
presents her “poly family,” which appears to consist of her husband, her
female lover, another married couple, the male lover of the woman in the
married couple, and two floating fringe lovers. It’s hard to follow.
Serial monogamy alone has given us a complicated landscape of fractured
and blended families; a world of poly families expanding and splintering
would be a bureaucratic nightmare. Maybe that’s one reason polygamy’s
illegal: Otherwise, some enterprising rogue could marry hordes of
foreign women, get them U.S. citizenships, and claim thousands of tax
exemptions.

As Kamala speaks, her pod sits intertwined with her and one another in a
massive display of poly PDA. Minus the freaky New Age talk, their
lifestyle looks like a lot of fun.

In concluding her lecture, Kamala says that in order to make a group
this large work, she has to be a “benevolent dictator” and, at times, a
“controlling bitch.” I wonder if that’s the secret to polyamory: a
yin-yang of wimpy spirituality and repressive fascism. I hope not.

Shama Helena advised me to observe from the outside and notice what I
gravitate toward. So that night, I gravitate toward Kamala’s pod,
scouring the retreat until I find three of her menfolk sitting in the
resort’s nudity-mandatory hot tub with the nerdy girl. One is Kamala’s
husband, Michael; another is one of her married lovers, Tahl; and the
third is one of their orbiting lovers. “We’re having a special party in
our room later,” the orbiter tells the nerdy girl. “You can come
watch—or participate, if you want.”

I slip into the hot tub and strike up a conversation with them. Michael
tells me that he originally met Kamala at a _puja_ in San Diego over a
decade ago. A puja is a Hindu ritual in which worshippers honor and
commune with a deity. And from what I gather, the polys have turned it
into an erotic guided meditation and dance party.

Tahl tells me his wife initially had no interest in polyamory. So in
order to open the marriage, he encouraged her to date other people while
he remained faithful. After letting her enjoy this freedom for a year or
so, he gradually started dating as well—which is when he met Kamala, who
convinced the couple to move in with her.

His words are a revelation. When I was with Ingrid, I was hoping for my
sexual liberation. But a far better way to encourage a partner to open a
relationship is to start by giving her the freedom that you want for
yourself.

I ask the orbiter what his story is. Squeezing Tahl on the shoulder, he
answers, “We dated each other, but we’re not gay.”

“How is that possible?” I ask.

“The new young poly scene is largely bisexual,” Michael explains.
“Everyone in our pod is bi, except for me. I’m just bi-_sensual_.”

This is the future of free love: no barriers whatsoever to sexuality,
including age, body type, and gender.

As the podmates talk about a reality show they’re working on and a
polyamory hotel they want to build, a voice suddenly bellows over the
water, “You guys ready?”

I look up and see a yoga stud from Kamala’s pod.

“Have you rounded up any more girls?” the orbiter asks him.

Kamala Devi and Shama Helena said polyamory was about loving
relationships, not casual sex. But these guys seem more like next-level
pickup artists, coming to these conferences with the intention of
sucking any available women into their powerful reality.

Although I suppose if you’re a spiritually evolved super-being, you
exist in a constant state of love, so there’s no such thing as casual
sex. If you love everyone, all sex is polyamory.

“No, but you’re going to miss the birthday spanking if you don’t hurry
up! Kamala’s waiting.”

The guys leave the tub, taking the nerdy girl with them. “If you want to
really learn more, you should come to this event we’re putting on called
Tantra-Palooza,” Michael says on the way out, offering me a consolation
prize. “It’s sex everywhere with everyone.”

I watch them leave, impressed that they’ve created not just their own
alternative relationship, but their own alternative reality. They’re
taking dating to a whole new level: Why go to bars or comb online
profiles to meet women? Just put together sexually themed hotels and
festivals, and they’ll flock to you in the hundreds.

If you build it, they will cum.

The following night, three dozen men and women with body parts falling
out of colorful sarongs, shawls, togas, and wraps gather in the
conference room, anxious for what’s about to transpire.

This will be my first puja.

“I have an announcement to make,” a gray-haired woman named Evalena Rose
says beforehand. The brochures on the welcome table identify her as a
practitioner of multidimensional healing, soul retrieval, and addiction
recovery. “Some of the women have complained that in the pujas, the
gentlemen were getting competitive and aggressive for the ladies. Please
respect appropriate boundaries in the pujas.”

She hands the microphone to Catamas, who begins by urging everyone to
dance freely and let go of their inhibitions. From what I’ve seen, I’m
not sure what inhibitions he could possibly be referring to.

He then instructs us to sit in a circle and make eye contact with one
another. I look into old eyes that are sad, joyful, restless, scared,
and scary, and into the uniformly youthful and bright eyes of everyone
in Kamala’s pod.

“Feel Mother Earth below you and Father Sky above, and allow them to
meet in your heart and flow love through your veins,” Catamas continues.

When he asks us to touch our hearts and rock back and forth, breathing
deeply to inhale the light, I start to lose myself in the moment, to
relax and suspend judgment, to feel connected to everyone else breathing
and swaying in the room. Then suddenly I hear Kamala Devi’s unmistakable
voice on the microphone: “Remember that you’re just three breaths away
from orgasm.”

And, unexpectedly, I start laughing. Her words are a complete non
sequitur, awkwardly thrown in to remind everyone that sex is still on
tonight’s menu. Evalena Rose shoots me a nasty look like I’m ruining the
puja. So I shut my mouth to contain the laughter and it starts to escape
through my nose. Just as I’m beginning to get a grip on myself again,
Kamala declares that she’s stepping in as the “priestess” of the room
and I lose it again. I suppose laughter is just my way of managing the
discomfort I’m feeling.

“I’d like you to now touch the source of your sacred energy and make a
connection with it,” Kamala intones. I place my palm over my heart, but
everyone else lays a hand over their junk. Clearly they know something I
don’t.

I move my hand to my sacred crotch and look at the diverse polys, their
hunger for one another growing through this spiritual foreplay. And my
crotch tells me, “Please, Neil, don’t do this to me. I don’t want any of
these people touching me.”

So I tell my crotch, “Listen, you’re the one who wanted free love.
You’re the one who thought the image of Shama Helena frolicking naked
was beautiful. Well, this is it. You’ve arrived. It’s no time to start
acting like a snob caught up with superficial things. We’ve left that
world. We must love all people.”

“Like that wart-covered Amazon over there?” my crotch responds
fearfully. “And that sweet wrinkly septuagenarian from the planet
Nibiru? And even that naked widowed Abraham Lincoln?”

_Sigh_. My crotch and I are out.

I slip away from the circle, sit in my safe spot against the wall, and
try to make myself inconspicuous as Kamala plucks the unspoken desire
out of the air and continues transitioning a roomful of strangers into a
roomful of fornicators.

One minute, everyone’s on the floor doing the log jam. The next, the men
are hugging one another bisensually. Soon a very randy black-haired,
pear-shaped fifty-something Tantrika is throwing her arms into the air
and moaning loudly.

My stomach rumbles hungrily. I was so concerned about making sure I saw
the puja tonight that I didn’t have dinner.

“Now walk around the room, and allow yourself to gaze at and appreciate
the feet you see,” Kamala instructs. “If you want, you may ask for
permission to touch your foot to someone else’s.”

She goes on, telling them to look at and touch a succession of
increasingly intimate body parts, like a naughty hokey pokey. From the
safety of the wall, it’s an enjoyable show. As Tahl takes the
black-haired Tantrika’s hand in his and spins her around in a blissful
ballroom dance, I wish I could be as free as he is, able to celebrate
the joy and beauty that’s in everyone. But even if everyone in the room
looked like a supermodel, I’d still be too weirded out to join in. I
need to take this opportunity to figure out why that is.

I tiptoe to the buffet table to forage for food, but all that remains is
a bag of organic olive-oil popcorn. Technically, popcorn is an
air-infused vegetable and olives are a fruit, so it’s not all that
unhealthy a meal. And the package does say _organic_. So I grab it and
return to my perch.

“Now gaze downward at each other’s lingams and yonis,” Kamala is saying.

The men and women wander through the room, staring lovingly at one
another’s crotches as Kamala reminds them, “Appreciate the beauty of her
sacred cathedral.” The oldest men start to cluster hungrily near the
youngest women as if it’s a game of musical chairs, and when Kamala
stops talking, they’ll get to feel up the closest body.

So far, pujas seem like the ultimate form of intimacy for intimacy
avoidants. For some of these men, it’s a way to experience love and
connection without attachment or commitment; for some of the women, a
way to have random sexual encounters without feeling dirty, used, or
unsafe.

In theory, this should be paradise for the sex addict that Rick thinks I
am. So why am I so uncomfortable? Why is the guy who wanted sexual
freedom so badly sitting against the wall feeling so . . . limited?

I reach into the popcorn bag and grab a handful of dinner. The crinkle
of the packaging reaches Kamala’s ears and she focuses in on the sound
like a cat. She slinks toward me, crouches until her face is just inches
from mine, and hisses, “This is a temple. We don’t eat in the temple.”

“Sorry, I didn’t know this was a temple.” I try to say it sincerely, but
it comes out sarcastically. And maybe that’s because I’m totally
confused.

When exactly did they turn this generic conference room into a holy
sanctuary? And if it’s just make-believe time, then why can’t my popcorn
be the temple’s equivalent of a Communion wafer? And how does she know
it’s not sacred popcorn, anointed in the oil of a virgin olive?

But I say nothing. I kiss the bag tenderly, and quietly place it at the
feet of the benevolent priestess. Goodbye, popcorn, our puja together
has ended. We were just three kernels away from orgasm.

Kamala walks away and instructs the polys to form groups of four, select
a person to be spoiled, and give him or her a three-way massage.

I still have a few pieces of popcorn in my fist, so I put them where
they belong: in my mouth. It is not a dietary necessity, but a minor act
of rebellion, the vestige of a male ego that doesn’t really belong here.
I am a food thief in the temple.

In a flash, Kamala is crouching in front of me again, her face a little
too close to mine. “I told you once not to eat here,” she whispers
staccato, the veins on her thin neck bulging angrily. “You need to take
that food out of here and eat it in the kitchen.”

I stand up grudgingly and she watches as I return the popcorn to its
rightful resting place on the buffet altar. I grab another handful to
satiate my hunger and—

Who am I kidding? I’m not taking the food because I’m hungry. I’m taking
it because I hate irrational, restrictive, unnecessary rules. That’s the
reason I left Ingrid and the world of monogamy in the first place. And
now I’m in a world where the rules are even more irrational and more
ridiculous. Kamala is not a good priestess for enmeshed men.

I hear her voice ringing through the metaphorical temple: “If you like
someone’s wand and want to touch it, don’t be shy.”

When I return from the kitchen, nearly everyone’s wraps have dropped to
the ground. Flaccid wands and hairy cathedrals are everywhere. All this
talk of priestesses, temples, and lingams seems like just a fancy excuse
to have casual sex—by pretending like it’s serious business.

Perhaps just as there are cults around religion, so too are there cults
around intimacy. But instead of monotheists, pantheists, and atheists,
there are monogamists, polyamorists, and celibates. Each belief system
comes with its own rituals, whether they be twelve steps, pujas,
exclusivity, adultery, or arguing about money every night. And people
like Patrick Carnes, Helen Fisher, and Kamala Devi are zealots who
believe they’ve found the one true intimacy.

I try to stop my critical thinking, to use the four adjustments and turn
judgment into compassion, to recognize the beauty of all these
shame-free sexual revolutionaries connecting and turning an ordinary
space into something sacred. Perhaps a puja is no different—and much
healthier—than drinking alcohol on a date. It’s a way for people to
lower their inhibitions and let go a little with one another.

And that’s when I get what this is all about: Thank you, Scott Catamas.
There’s a disparity between the masculine desire for sex, which tends to
be carnal and ego based, and the feminine desire for sex, which can be
more emotional and spiritual. So if swinging is for horny men, then this
scene is for sensual women. Orgies are for ethical sluts; pujas are for
goddesses.

Same destination, different ritual.

I look down and notice a few pieces of popcorn on the ground. I can’t
leave these sacrilegious foodstuffs on a sanctified floor. They’re
virgins. They don’t belong here.

I pick them up and look for somewhere to throw them out, but I don’t
want to disturb the puja again. I could just eat them, though I don’t
want Abraham Lincoln’s toe fungus in my digestive system. I glance at
him and his mouth is hinged open, moaning appreciatively as the old
Tantrika massages him.

I conceal the offending popcorn in my pocket, and instantly the dictator
returns. However, she’s forgotten to bring the benevolence. “I told you
not to eat here!” Her eyes bug out of her skull and bore into mine with
what appears to be hatred. She has shape-shifted from priestess to
demon. _Devi,_ I realize, is just one letter away from _Devil_. “You’re
not respecting my puja! Your energy is interfering with my experience
and the energy in the room, so I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”

“I was just cleaning the temple floor.” I hold her gaze. “And what’s
wrong with my energy? It’s not like I can control it.” I’ve never had
anyone insult my energy before. I actually think it’s worse than being
called ugly. After all, you can’t hide your energy or go on an energy
diet or get your energy surgically altered. Even in a room full of blind
people, you’re still a monster.

“We can discuss this tomorrow. But right now, you need to leave!”

I want to stay and see what happens next, but I heave a sigh and rise to
my feet. She’s right. These people need to feel comfortable getting
naked and weird together without some overly clothed journalist eating
junk food in the corner and silently mocking them.

This is truly the blackest day of my life: I’ve been kicked out of an
orgy for eating popcorn.

I rise to my feet and walk out to the picnic tables on the patio.
Fortunately, there are big glass windows. I can’t hear the people
inside, but at least I can see them. So I sit forlorn on top of a table
and watch, the cool night air biting my face. I’m a grounded teenager
again, sent to my room without dinner and forbidden from playing with
girls.

Gradually the massages become more erotic. Kamala starts twirling and
dancing through the writhing foursomes ecstatically, her arms
outstretched like she’s Julie Andrews in _The Sound of Music._ For a
moment, the spectacle looks otherworldly and transcendent. But when the
orbiter I met in the hot tub whips out his dick and masturbates above
Diana, one of the reluctant poly wives, until he comes all over her
enormous breasts, the entire façade of sacredness comes toppling down
for me. It looks more like a scene from a gonzo porn film.

If this is polyamory, then it’s not for me. Not only would I prefer
monogamy with Ingrid to doing the sexual hokey pokey with a bunch of
self-appointed deities every night, but I’d probably be banned from the
scene entirely after a few more pujas. Because I’ve done some desperate
things in my life to get laid, but I’ve never faked a spiritual belief.

“You should have talked to me first,” Lawrence says. “I would have
warned you to stay away from the World Polyamory Association or any of
those kinds of events. They’re organized by these New Age people from
Maui, and the batshit-crazy types leech onto them.”

Lawrence is a meditation and sexuality teacher. He’s tall with a shaved
head, and is so healthy his face glows as if he’s swallowed a lightbulb.
I’d met him once before at a party, where I introduced him to my friend
Leah, a girl-next-door type with a wholesome face you could gaze at for
hours. Leah called me afterward and said that on her first date with
him, she had the best night of orgasms of her life. I haven’t seen
either of them since, but evidently those orgasms produced so much
oxytocin that, four years later, they’re still dating.

“It’s my first open relationship,” Leah tells me, beaming. I ask them
how it developed, and it turns out that just like Tahl with his wife,
Lawrence initially gave—and continues to give—Leah more freedom than he
takes himself so he can teach her a lack of fear and possessiveness by
example.

We’re sitting on the patio of a pizza restaurant in Los Angeles, where
I’m attending my first polyamory meet-up group. I returned home from the
conference disappointed and discouraged, but after digging deeper found
that there’s more to the polyamory scene than pujas and priestesses.

And at this meet-up, that’s certainly the case. More than half the
attendees are from a completely different poly offshoot: the BDSM scene
(bondage & discipline, dominance & submission, and sadism & masochism).
Like the conference attendees, most of the people here are over forty.
But instead of wearing togas and sarongs, they’re clad in vinyl and
leather. Instead of goddesses and priestesses, they’re masters and
mistresses. Instead of worshipping the light, they worship the darkness.

To my surprise, among them are Lawrence and Leah, who came to meet one
of Lawrence’s students. So I’ve been asking them about the polyamory
conference, trying to get some perspective on what planet I was on.

“I don’t understand what pujas have to do with polyamory,” I tell
Lawrence. “It doesn’t even matter whether the participants are in
relationships or not.”

“At the end of the day, what you saw there is a specific type of
polyamory,” he explains. “Tantra polyamory.”

Before the conference, I thought Tantra was the practice of holding out
on having an orgasm during sex in hope of a bigger, better, longer high.
Since the conference, I have no clue what it is. Kamala Devi defined
Tantra as “life itself.” And the orbiter definitely wasn’t denying
himself release when he shot all over that woman’s breasts.

“So in a nutshell, what is Tantra to these people?”

“What they call Tantra is basically an American phenomenon, invented as
a way of talking about sex without using the word _sex_.” So far,
Lawrence is the first person I’ve met in this world who I feel like I
can relate to, who doesn’t start conversations with “namaste” and end
them by asking about ETs. “Because of all the immoral connotations of
sex, they make it into something divine and polite instead of physical
and passionate. I think this is because a lot of the gurus know that
most women need an emotional connection to have sex, and spirituality is
the quickest, deepest way there.”

“Unfortunately,” Leah adds, “some of the women are just replacing one
type of predator with another. Lawrence used to work with this one
Tantric sex guru who told women his dick was the Godhead, and they had
to open up and receive it to be awakened. He called his sperm the nectar
of the gods. Afterward, a lot of the women felt deceived and used.”

Since the conference, I’d been feeling guilty for just dipping my toe in
the water of the scene rather than immersing myself before forming a
conclusion. After all, pujas are the closest thing I’ve seen to free
love in my life. But after talking to Leah and Lawrence, it’s clear that
what I saw didn’t actually represent polyamory, just one of its many
branches. But at least I learned that there are accessible communities
where sex and love are seen as free and joyous, not possessive and
pathological.

As we’re speaking, a heavyset, deep-voiced African American man standing
nearby extends a thick hand and introduces himself as Orpheus Black.
He’s with three women: one he introduces as his slave, another as his
partner, and a third as one of his three wives. He tells me that since
marrying multiple people can come with a one-year prison sentence in
California, he committed to two of those wives in a pagan ritual known
as a handfasting ceremony.

With his wives, girlfriends, and submissives, Orpheus comes across like
a Master Yod. So I respectfully blitz him with questions, hoping to
learn what I’d wanted to at the conference. “I’m trying to put together
a house like yours,” I explain. “Do you have any advice on how to make
it work?”

He lets out a long, low chuckle, then leans in conspiratorially. “It’s a
full-time job. You have to be the leader. You can’t show any weakness or
doubt, or you’ll get eaten alive.”

That doesn’t sound like much fun. “But if you can’t show vulnerability,
then you don’t really have any intimacy,” I respond, sounding a little
too much like Joan. “What if, instead of a master/slave thing, I want
everyone to be equals?”

“No matter how you do it, all the women need to be equals on some
level,” Orpheus responds. “The key is to make sure you don’t have more
feelings for one than the other. The other key is to sell them on the
concept of the future but ground them in reality.”

“So what is the future?”

“Family.” He says the word powerfully, then crosses his arms over his
chest and nods with deep assurance. “You have to make sure they all know
you’re a family and nothing ever supersedes the family. The mantra
should be doing what’s best for the community, not for the individual.”

The relationship he’s describing seems even more restrictive than a
monogamous one. Perhaps that’s because restraints, rules, punishments,
and power are integral to the BDSM community. And while hog-tying
people, whipping them, and taking them for walks on a collar and leash
may be fun for variety, they’re not my kink. I’m not a top or a bottom.
I’m a middle.

Why is it that in order to escape monogamy, I have to look so far out on
the fringes? Or are there many more people doing this, but hiding in
shame, scared of the consequences to their career, family, or reputation
if they’re outed?

I drive home discouraged, worried that I’m never going to find what I’m
looking for or a place where I fit in or more people for my pod with
Belle.

That night, I dream I’m in the back row at a magic show with Rick Rubin.
Ingrid is there, but she’s in the front row. Afterward, I sit in my car,
waiting for Ingrid to arrive so we can talk about the performance. But
she never appears.

I wake up covered in sweat and filled with dread that I made a bad
decision, that I’ve lost Ingrid forever. All the pain I never felt after
Ingrid moved out suddenly overwhelms me. I look at the Survivor,
surviving on my ledge as proof that I do have a heart, and sink into a
deep melancholy.

I’ve officially tipped to the other side of ambivalence: Instead of
wondering whether to leave Ingrid, now I’m wondering if I should have
stayed. I consider reaching out and telling her I want to forget this
whole search and just be with her, that the security of the cage is
better than the freedom of the wild. But I’ve learned enough to know
that these are just the thoughts of an ambivalent, manifestations of
fear and loneliness from my failure so far to find what I left to look
for. All that would happen is we’d begin the love avoidance cycle all
over again.

For most men, what’s tougher than breaking up is the moment when their
ex finally falls out of love with them and lets go, perhaps because it
triggers a childhood fear—a psychological terror—of losing the first
woman whose love they needed: their mother. And so, as Sheila would
recommend, I let myself feel the pain, the loneliness, and the fear,
using all my strength as the days pass to keep from giving in and
reaching out to Ingrid.

In the meantime, I continue to attend occasional polyamory and
sex-positive events, but without much luck or any adventure I’d actually
want to take part in. As the pain turns to mourning and the mourning
turns to acceptance, I decide to stop going to them altogether.

And that’s when I finally find the scene I’m looking for: not at a
polyamory meet-up, but in the laundry room of Seth MacFarlane’s house.

Entry from Ingrid’s Journal

UNSENT LETTER

Dear Neil,

I was hoping that we’d meet each other at the end of this hard road. But
as the days pass, I see that our roads won’t meet again. I’ve been
scared, hoping you could save me and take me away from this road onto
yours. But it hasn’t happened.

I didn’t think this was something that was going to come up, but I have
met someone. Meeting this new person was a complete accident. I don’t
know what it is, but I really like him. At first I thought I could have
some fun with him and nothing would come of it. Maybe I’ll get tired of
him and stop answering his calls. But as I’m spending time with him, I
realize this is a person I cannot just use like a rag doll. I can tell
he likes me a lot. Seems too soon to know, but my intuition is very
strong. I would like to give him a chance.

To be honest, I’m completely terrified. I don’t want to be in another
relationship for a while. But at the same time, it feels right for some
reason.

Sometimes I wish you would come and take me away, but as the hours go
by, I look back and see you so far away, almost like a blur in the
distance.

I’m sorry we’ve gone through this. I really wish you the best in life
and I hope you will find someone who can make you as happy as you made
me. And I do mean it. With you I was the happiest I ever was.

Goodbye,

Ingrid

_N_icole reminds me of a shorter, more conservative, even skinnier
version of Ingrid. She’s five foot four and wearing what looks like a
blue prom dress, her shoulder blades jutting over the top like the frame
of a kite. She’s a lawyer visiting from San Francisco. The kind of girl
you marry and take home to Mom—unless your mom is like mine.

And I’ve known her for only half an hour. We’re at a Japanese restaurant
with a mutual friend, a film producer named Randy. He and his wife have
invited us to join them for dinner, followed by a party at the Hollywood
Hills home of Seth MacFarlane, the creator of _Family Guy_. Randy’s
wife, Jessica, is naturally full lipped and voluptuous. _Smoldering_
would be a word to describe her. _Uptight_ would be another.

When I tell them that I’m looking for an open-minded partner, she scowls
and interjects, “I would never have a threesome.”

“Why?” Her vehemence takes me by surprise.

“It’s just that Randy and I love each other very much, and our love is
real. And those are not the kinds of things you do when you’re married.”

Her words send a chill up my spine. She’s verbalized my fear: that
marriage means the end of fun, that the things a woman will do with a
random guy she meets in Cabo are actually more fun than the things
she’ll do with the man spending the rest of his life with her. My head
drops into my hand before I can stop it. Randy looks as disappointed as
I do, but conceals it slightly better.

“What’s wrong?” she asks.

“Look at Randy. He’s dying inside. No one wants to hear that his sex
life with you would be better if he hadn’t married you.” Randy avoids
eye contact with her—and the fight that will occur later if he agrees
with me. “So if you weren’t married, would you—if the circumstances were
right and it just happened—ever have a threesome?”

She doesn’t say anything, but a smile flickers across her lips. “You
would!” I exclaim. Something in me is trying to prove a point. “So let
me ask you, then: If a man’s need for sexual variety isn’t met in
wedlock, what needs of yours aren’t fulfilled in your relationship?”
Even the word _wedlock_ sounds more like a prison sentence than a free
choice motivated by love.

“I’d say the needs that most women don’t get fulfilled are for emotional
connection and emotional support. But I don’t look to get those needs
fulfilled entirely by Randy.”

“See, and that’s where I’m having a problem! At least you can get those
needs met by having emotional connections with family and friends
outside your relationship. But with sexual needs, you’re stuck trying to
get them all met by just one person. And if you try to get them from
anyone else, you’re pond scum.”

That’s when Nicole turns slowly, gazes at me with soft blue eyes, and
says quietly, “I couldn’t agree more.”

“Really?”

“I just look like a good girl on the outside,” she tells me.

“It would be great if you could talk my wife into a threesome,” Randy
whispers as we wander around MacFarlane’s backyard an hour later. It is
not a small party: There are ice sculptures, porta-potties, a full
orchestra, and lots of thin, awkward, six-foot-tall women.

Nicole stays close to me the whole time. And gradually the air around us
charges: She makes a little more eye contact than she needs to and
laughs at even the bad jokes I make. These are known in the game as
indicators of interest. And for the first time since I broke up with
Ingrid, they’re coming from a woman who just may be open to . . . being
open.

I take her hand and lead her to an outdoor couch as MacFarlane croons
“Luck Be a Lady” in front of the orchestra. For some reason, Randy
follows us and sits next to Nicole. I’m not sure if he’s there to
protect her or if he’s just completely oblivious. While whispering in
Nicole’s ear, I poke Randy’s leg with my hand to signal him to make an
exit. He sits there unreactive, as if absorbed by something he’s
thinking.

“Do you think he’s going to leave so we can kiss?” I ask Nicole.

“I don’t think he’d leave if we started fucking,” she replies.

What’s rare about Nicole is that she doesn’t seem to have any hang-ups
about sex. And that’s the kind of woman I’ve been hoping to find: one
who’s free of the sexual shame that parents heap on their daughters as
soon as they’re old enough to ask why boys look different down there.

I remember one night I was sitting in a hot tub with a divorced man who
was complaining about his dating difficulties as his two preteen
daughters splashed around him. “Boys are weird,” his eldest said in
response to a comment he made. He looked at her approvingly and told me,
“They’re not dating anyone until they’re thirty.” His youngest daughter
responded, “I’m going to be a single pug lady!” And that’s when I
realized that guys bring their dating problems on themselves. They
program their daughter with an aversion to men and sex for fear that
she’ll meet someone just like her father, then they meet someone else’s
daughter and expect her to just jump into bed without anxiety or
reservation.

I run my hand through Nicole’s hair and we start making out. As the
kissing intensifies and hands begin wandering, Randy sits still next to
us like some sort of Rodin sculpture: The Voyeur.

I pry my lips off Nicole’s and tell Randy, “We’re gonna take a lap, then
let’s all leave.”

Inside MacFarlane’s house, Nicole and I try the handles of various
rooms, but they’re all locked. This is clearly not his first party. Then
I spot a glass window and, through it, a laundry room. Fortunately the
door’s unlocked.

We slip inside and close the door behind us. I switch the light off so
no one can see through the window. Then I throw Nicole against the door,
reach under her dress, and massage her through her panties. She arches
her back and moans, then starts fiddling with the buttons of my pants.
Compared to the sacred sex at the World Polyamory Association
Conference, dirty, furtive, and spontaneous sex feels a lot more
meaningful.

Many women think that if they put out too quickly, their partner won’t
respect them. This is not the case. It’s not about waiting for a certain
quantity of time before having sex, it’s about waiting for a certain
quality of connection. And I already like Nicole enough to hope she’ll
consider being my consensually nonmonogamous polyamorous pluralistic
multiple-relating primary partner. Maybe she’ll be interested in moving
into the free-love house with Belle and me.

As she kneels and goes down on me, I reach into my back pocket and pull
out a condom. And that’s when it happens.

She removes her lips, gazes up at me innocently, and says, “I can’t have
sex with you unless my boyfriend’s here.”

It takes a moment for the meaning of the words to register in my brain.
It’s not a sentence I’ve heard before. I’m more used to someone saying,
“I can’t have sex with you _because_ I have a boyfriend.”

I repeat the word like a cry of pain: “Boyfriend?!” Someone else is
already living my dream with her.

“We’re in an open relationship. But I’m not allowed to fuck anyone
without him there.” The disappointment on my face must be clear, because
she adds, “But when we do fuck, it’s going to be very, very good.”

She slides her mouth around me again. “Is it okay if I come?” I ask. I’m
not sure why I’m checking for permission. Maybe I need to call her
boyfriend and make sure it’s okay with him too.

“Of course,” she replies. Good answer.

I watch her work, but I’m so confused and let down that it’s hard to
stay in the moment. I remember watching the documentary _Anatomy of
Sex_. It explains that when the penis is limp, that’s when it’s actually
tense. The muscles are constricted. When it gets aroused, the penis
relaxes. And this allows blood to enter, which expands the spongy tissue
and creates the erection. So you need to be relaxed to get hard. You
can’t get hard when you’re tense. And I’m tense, because I finally found
someone open-minded who I can see myself dating—and she’s taken.

Unable to perform, I zip up.

“I think I was meant to meet you,” I tell her as we sneak out of the
room. “I’ve been thinking a lot about open relationships lately.”

“Are you in the Lifestyle?” she asks, speaking the words cautiously,
probingly.

“What do you mean by the Lifestyle?”

“I hate that name. It’s swinging.”

“Wouldn’t I need a girlfriend to swing?”

“Not necessarily. Do you know about the Lifestyle Lounge?”

“No.”

“It’s a website my boyfriend and I belong to. You can find someone
there.”

“Is that where all the sane ones have been hiding?”

“They’re actually hiding at Bliss. And they’re really hot. We’re going
in a couple of weeks. You should come with us.”

“Will there be pujas there?” I ask, just to make sure.

“What are pujas?”

“Great, I’m in.”

“Thank you again for last night and for respecting my boundaries,”
Nicole texts as she boards a plane home to San Francisco the following
day. “I’m looking forward to getting together again, this time with
James.”

I had hoped to be on the other side of the relationship—and I’m not sure
I’m comfortable with a guy in the room, even if he’s just watching.
Especially if he’s watching. But Shama Helena did advise me to observe
some relationships, and this may be a chance to do that.

Unfortunately, I get the chance sooner than I expected. Two hours later,
Nicole texts and says we need to talk.

It’s never a good sign when someone you just had sexual contact with
_needs_ to talk. The only thing I can imagine is that she has an STI she
didn’t tell me about.

I call and ask what’s wrong. “I just had a discussion about trust with
James, and I crossed some boundaries with you that I shouldn’t have,”
she tells me, distraught.

“I thought you had an open relationship.” Maybe their relationship isn’t
actually open but just ajar.

“Actually, our agreement was that I wasn’t supposed to have sex _or_
oral sex,” she confesses. “I didn’t think it would be that big of a
problem for him, but when I started telling him what happened, he got
really pissed. I honestly think this could be the end. Because he wasn’t
there, it wasn’t okay. He says if I loved him, I wouldn’t have done
that. The fact that it started in the laundry room made it seem cheaper
to him, and he’s mad that I jeopardized the relationship in that way.”
She pauses. “And what makes it worse is that we’re lawyers, so contracts
are important.”

An hour later, he texts: “Neil, James here. You shouldn’t feel bad about
anything you did.” I don’t. “I need to think through some things.
Unconditional trust is vital when you live life the way we’ve chosen.
Nicole violated my trust and that’s something I need to process.”

So far, it sounds like their open relationship has just as much drama as
a closed relationship. And the drama is about the same thing: trust.
Perhaps the reason friendships tend to last longer than relationships is
that most of them don’t come with rigid rules and exclusivity clauses.

A minute later, James texts again: “I’m not sure where this goes next
(and I don’t know where you want this to go). That’s just something we
all need to figure out together. I will text you once I’ve worked it
through on my end.”

The word _together_ strikes me as oddly inclusive. It almost sounds as
if I have the option of being involved in their relationship.

Whatever the case may be, I hope it hasn’t ruined my chances of going to
Bliss.

Swinging is a victim of its own success.

When most people think of a marriage with sexual freedom, _swinging_ is
the first word that comes to mind. However, the public relations
campaign against swinging has been so complete and thorough that the
word alone evokes derision rather than concupiscence. Even rock groupies
have a better reputation.

The main strikes against swinging are, first of all, its apocryphal
depiction as an activity mostly for old, out-of-shape, tastelessly
attired, and otherwise dull suburban couples. And, second, the idea that
swing clubs are crawling with diseases. Partly for these reasons,
adherents have attempted to mitigate the stigma by renaming their scene
_the Lifestyle_ instead.

In swinging’s defense, the judgment that only good-looking people are
allowed to have pleasure is more a condemnation of the accuser than the
accused. As for STIs, researchers say that HIV hasn’t been any more
prevalent among swingers than the general population. As one researcher
put it: It’s used as a moral argument, but it’s not a scientific one.

If all parties were like Bliss, however, swingers would be envied
instead of mocked.

Nicole sits at a Chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas Palms Casino next
to a man who I presume is James. He makes strong eye contact and shakes
my hand firmly. It’s an overly masculine greeting, formal and slightly
self-conscious. Evidently it is customary for strangers who’ve shared
the same woman to greet each other like gunslingers before a shootout.

Though he’s in his mid-thirties, James is dressed more like he’s in his
mid-twenties, with a garish fitted T-shirt and factory-faded jeans. He’s
tall, with close-cropped blond hair and a solid, broad frame, which
seems to be more a result of genetics than the gym. So though he’s big,
he doesn’t look like he’d last long in a fight—which is a good sign,
since he may not be happy that Nicole and I have been texting constantly
since we met. Out of respect, however, I’ve made sure to text him once
for every five she and I send.

“I just want to let you know there’s no bad blood between you and me at
all,” he says. “As a result of what happened, Nicole and I have actually
improved our communication and strengthened our relationship.”

Well, I’m glad that’s resolved, so I can have sex with your girlfriend
now.

We’re soon joined by two couples, each with men who dress too young for
their age and women who look like they stepped off the pages of _Maxim_.
One is a sculpted, statuesque, raven-haired woman. The other is a living
Barbie doll who introduces herself as Chelsea.

Chelsea is tanned bronze, dyed blond, and toned tight. She has had one
surgery, bringing her to a D cup; the rest comes from hard work. I soon
learn that she’s the product of at least five hours a day of dedication
to her appearance, 365 days a year, for the last fifteen years of her
life. That’s more than 27,375 hours of perfection and hundreds of
thousands of dollars in makeup, manicures, clothing, shoes, doctors,
hairdressers, aestheticians, and trainers.

Beauty like this is an addiction, catering to a masculine fantasy that
only gets more impossible to match every decade as photo-painting, then
airbrushing, then Photoshopping, then photo-editing apps keep raising
the bar in the endless arms race of female perfection.

I’m clearly the weak link here—and, as a solo male, perhaps even persona
non grata. Fortunately, Nicole flew an old friend of hers into town who,
she says with a suggestive smile, can be my “special date.”

As everyone settles in, James asks about my last relationship. It seems
like he’s testing me, trying to gauge what kind of person I am,
determining if I’m someone worthy of sleeping with his girlfriend. I
tell him the truth: that I wanted to open it up, but Ingrid had no
interest.

“I think the mistake you made with her,” Nicole jumps in, “is that you
made it all about you wanting to be with other people. You should have
made it instead about wanting to have sexual adventures together. This
way, you can include her rather than making it seem like a failing on
her part. That’s what worked on me.”

She’s right: I was selfish with Ingrid. I just wanted my own pleasure,
regardless of how much pain it would cause her. Perhaps if, instead, I’d
wanted to do something that would have added to her life and to our
relationship, she would have been more open to it. Or perhaps not. But
it definitely would have been a better way to go about it.

Like many people in the Lifestyle, James and Nicole tell me they never
thought they were going to be part of it. They grew up believing in the
marriage myth: exclusive, happy, and ’til death. So, before ever
meeting, they married other people, but found the reality of it more
life draining than life affirming.

“Everyone at this table, and almost everyone I know in the Lifestyle, is
either divorced or got out of a really long traditional relationship
beforehand,” Nicole says. “You kind of need to get that first marriage
or big-deal relationship out of your system before you can come around
to the truth that having sex with someone else has no effect on your
love for each other. If anything, it can add to it.”

She tells me she met James at the law office where they work. After they
dated for a few months, he took her to a strip club for her birthday,
which excited her enough to want to try swinging. At first they went to
public swing clubs, but they had trouble finding couples they liked.
Then they started exploring the swinger personals, where they found
couples they enjoyed spending time in and out of bed with. And finally
they discovered Bliss, which requires couples to submit photographs and
an application for review before allowing them access to the
members-only parties it throws at mansions, clubs, and resorts.

“No one we work with knows we do this,” James tells me. “If anyone found
my phone, they’d freak out if they saw the messages. Half of them are
from guys in the Lifestyle talking about their girlfriend’s menstrual
cycle and saying they can’t come out to party for a few days.”

When a waitress arrives to take our order, James asks, “Should we just
share everything?”

“I’m not in a sharing mood,” the raven-haired woman says as her
boyfriend sits sulking beside her. It’s the first time she’s spoken
since I arrived. “Put the two of us on a separate check.”

James leans in and whispers to me: “They’ve been arguing all day, so we
can’t take them out with us tonight. In the swinger community, you’ll
see couples fighting, throwing drinks at each other, or running off
blindly into the street. The thing about swinging is that it strengthens
good relationships and destroys bad ones.”

Chelsea and her fiancé, Tommy, a spiky-haired jock wearing an untucked
burgundy dress shirt, seem more ready for the night’s adventure. “We’re
new to the Lifestyle, but we don’t go to vanilla clubs or parties
anymore,” Chelsea tells me as Tommy gazes hungrily at her, apparently
committing covert sexualized violence. “At Lifestyle events, everyone’s
cooler and more fun and more comfortable with themselves. And the girls
aren’t catty and jealous of each other, like in the vanilla world.”

That word _vanilla_ comes up often in the conversation, always with
disdain. The term refers to people who are not in the Lifestyle. When
it’s mentioned, I laugh and joke back about those lame vanillas who ruin
everything. But inside I wonder: Am I vanilla?

I think about Belle, the Australian woman who’s coming to stay with me.
I could probably share her. And I’m going to meet Anne the nudist in
Paris in a couple of weeks. I could swap her for Chelsea. But sitting
here, looking at James and Tommy, I just can’t imagine feeling
compersion while watching them violate Ingrid’s every orifice as she
gushes with orgasm after orgasm.

I think back to my conversation with Shama Helena: If I want true
freedom, I need to accept that the path leading there is going to be one
of discomfort and vulnerability.

“So where’s my date?” I ask Nicole.

“She’s coming. You’ll see.”

The anticipation is killing me. Blind dates are awkward enough, but
blind swinger dates are even more stressful. I wonder how I’m supposed
to greet her: “I’m looking forward to sharing you tonight”?

As we move through the lobby after dinner, Nicole and James greet
various porn-star-looking women—all of them Bliss members, walking with
a deadly confident swagger that actually does make the tourists around
them seem vanilla. Some non-Lifestyle clubgoers are wearing equally
revealing outfits, but the Bliss people seem to be owning their
sexuality rather than just trying it on for the night.

The pariah couple break away to deal with their drama as we take the
elevator to Chelsea’s suite so the women can change. I can’t imagine how
they could possibly get any sexier—until I see the room, which looks
like a Victoria’s Secret store. There’s lingerie, makeup, perfume,
shoes, and lotions everywhere. Tommy is in the sex-toy business, so his
contributions to the tableau are duffel bags and briefcases full of his
merchandise, plus a camera on a tripod with professional lighting
equipment next to it. Everything shamed in rehab is here in full
splendor.

“It looks like a porn set,” I tell James.

“What you’re going to see tonight is better than that,” he replies.
“You’ll never want to watch porn again.”

Chelsea gives Nicole a Victoria’s Secret gift bag while Tommy pops open
the champagne. This is swinger foreplay. Though Tommy seems a bit
fanatical, I’m much more comfortable in this scene than at the puja.
Instead of dressing sex up in worship and religion, they’re dressing it
up in lingerie and champagne.

Suddenly, there’s a knock on the door.

“That’s her,” Nicole says in a singsong voice.

My heart leaps into my throat. What if she isn’t attracted to me? What
if I’m not attracted to her? What if no one is attracted to us? What if,
what if, what if . . .

“Don’t worry,” Nicole adds intuitively. “It’s her first time at one of
these parties too.”

Instantly I feel better.

The door opens, revealing a tall woman with metallic red hair who looks
like she belongs on the cover of a fashion magazine. She has pixielike
features with an almost imperceptible dusting of freckles, smoky black
eyeshadow, and full sensuous lips. Her hair is cut short and swept just
above her right eye. It’s a powerful beauty that’s simultaneously
mainstream and alternative, masculine and feminine, young and old. Most
strikingly of all, I know her.

“Sage?” I ask. I’d seen her only once before, but I never forgot her. I
was interviewing a band in New York for _Rolling Stone,_ and she was
hanging out with them. We barely spoke a word to each other, but she had
an angelic glow to her, like a patron saint of alcoholic rock stars,
that haunted me long afterward.

She squeals in delight, wraps her arms around my neck, and presses her
body against mine. Either she remembers me too or she’s just really
friendly. I breathe in her heat, her moisturizer, her hair pomade. This
is going to be a good night.

As Chelsea, Sage, and Nicole parade to the casino’s club in their high
heels and microskirts, every head turns—even the dealers crane their
necks to catch a glimpse. It’s unclear whether they’re looking because
they think the women are attractive or prostitutes or both, but it
doesn’t matter. In this moment, we are Vegas.

I trail behind them with James and Tommy, who are enjoying the wake
their partners are creating. “God, look at her,” Tommy says, lusting
after Chelsea. He runs a hand through his obsidian-black hair, which is
so gelled I can practically hear it crinkle. “I’m going to marry her. I
can’t believe how lucky I am.”

A freakishly tall man and his dolled-up wife fall into step with us. “My
girl and I married sixteen years ago and we’ve been in the Lifestyle the
whole time,” he tells us proudly. “Check out her body. What a great
body!”

Swinging is definitely a step closer to the solution I’m looking for.
Instead of lusting after other women, these guys still lust after the
one they’re with. And rather than letting themselves go, the couples
stay in shape because they know they’re going be naked in front of
strangers. Perhaps swinging is the fountain of youth: a formula for
escaping the monotony of growing older together and the loss of
sexuality that comes with work, parenting, familiarity, and increasing
responsibilities. Because despite the odds, after years together, these
couples seem to have all three of Helen Fisher’s drives—for sex,
romantic love, and deep attachment—still running strong with each other.

Soon, we arrive at our destination: a dance club with a long line
outside. As a beautiful Bliss promoter whisks us past the velvet ropes,
the tall swinger who joined us pleads with his wife, “Honey, those two
girls I told you about are already inside. Can I fuck them tonight?”

Okay, maybe they do still lust after other women. But at least they get
permission first.

Couples in the Lifestyle don’t merely go to clubs and hotels. Instead,
they stage what they call _takeovers_. This involves invading a public
space with rampant sexual energy and shocking the vanillas. While they
don’t swap there, they make plans and secure invitations for hook-ups
afterward—and get to feel cool and one up in the meantime. The real
swinging tonight, James tells me as we join a huge coterie of Bliss
members inside, will be taking place at private parties in select hotel
rooms later.

On the dance floor, a blonde in a tight, sequined silver dress is
undulating so suggestively that my heart rate instantly spikes. Take the
richest, most confident, most famous man in the world—and he’s no match
for a beautiful woman in the throes of a dance that oozes sexual energy.
This is why fortunes are lost, families are torn apart, and wars are
fought.

“I feel comfortable here,” James says. “These are my kind of people.”

Within moments, our dates have joined the enchantress on the dance
floor. Conventional femininity seems amplified here, while conventional
masculinity is tempered. Among their fellow swingers, the women feel
safer being sexual—and being appreciated for it—than at vanilla events:
Guys aren’t ogling or groping or chasing or hitting on them. And, as
Chelsea said, women aren’t scowling at them as if they’re competition.

My eyes lock on Sage, who’s dancing with her legs splayed and her hips
possessed, as if inviting lust to enter without knocking. Moments later,
she walks over with the enchantress from the dance floor in tow. “Oh my
god, your girl is so sexy,” the blonde says. Her hands are all over
Sage. She points to a short woman in a bridal veil who’s standing nearby
with an even shorter man in a tuxedo. “See my friends over there?
They’re getting married tomorrow. Can you fuck her hard tonight? She
needs to get fucked.”

“We’ll see what the night brings,” I respond, certain that I’ve died and
gone to relationship heaven. Sadly, I wouldn’t be the only guy in Vegas
to have fucked a bachelorette the night before her wedding.

As the blonde sashays away, Sage leans in close, until her cheek is
grazing mine. “If I’m dating someone,” she says, “I don’t want to be
with other guys.”

“Really?” I’m shocked. I hope she’s not another monogamous one.

“If someone I’m with were to allow that to happen, I’d consider it
unmanly.”

“Then why did you come here?”

“I just got out of a relationship, and I haven’t seen Nicole in forever.
So she brought me out here to have some fun and see the scene.”

“I actually just broke up too.”

Her tongue flits alluringly between her lips and she tells me about her
last relationship. She dated a guy who was trying to create what he
called a circle—a group relationship consisting of himself, Sage, and
two other women. It sounds very Father Yod–like. However, he eventually
became obsessed with one of the women, broke up with everyone else,
started dating her exclusively, and recently married her. Evidently a
line was preferable to a circle for him.

I’m relieved that Sage is actually open to alternative relationships.
Suddenly, the world of Joan’s office seems very far away. Here, there is
a different kind of normal, where it’s Joan who would be shamed—for
being so aggressively vanilla, a counter-sexual-revolutionary.

I lead Sage to a couch so we can get to know each other better. I tell
her about cheating on Ingrid and going to rehab, and she tells me about
cheating on her poly boyfriend. When he found out, he said there was
only one way she could make it up to him: to arrange to meet the other
guy at a bar, go down on her boyfriend in the bathroom first, and then,
when she met the guy, kiss him, spit her boyfriend’s sperm into the
guy’s mouth, and tell him what it was.

“I still feel really bad that I did it,” she says. “But at the time, I
felt so guilty about cheating, I would have done anything to make it up
to him.”

“I get it. I felt the same way.”

Whether or not swinging is for me, at least I’ve found a world of people
I’m comfortable with, who appear to have both intimacy and openness.
Plus I’ve found Nicole, Chelsea, and Sage—and I don’t have to choose
between them, which is ideal for an ambivalent. Nor do I have to keep my
distance from someone I’m attracted to just because she happens to be in
a relationship at the moment. Though the cheating is a little worrisome,
who am I to judge? At least this scene is more sensible than life after
sex rehab, when women were triggers to be avoided rather than people to
be enjoyed.

As we’re speaking, James rushes over and tells us the group is leaving
to go to an invitation-only after-party with an _Eyes Wide Shut_ theme.
“But first,” he announces, “I brought some party favors.”

We stop by his room, where he unzips a toiletries bag and pulls out a
bottle of GHB. I’ve never done GHB, though I recall reading a disturbing
article about a woman who was slipped some as a date rape drug on a
cruise ship. Her system slowed down so much that she passed out, stopped
breathing, and died.

“How do I know what dose to take?” I ask James.

He slices the air in an X pattern with an eyedropper like a wimpy Zorro.
“Don’t worry: You’re in good hands.”

“Then make mine half the dose you’re thinking of giving me.” GHB is
odorless and tasteless: If he wants revenge for the laundry room
incident with Nicole, now would be the perfect opportunity.

“You’ll enjoy it. It’s like being drunk, but without the sloppiness.”

“I’m sold.” Nervous but sold. In rehab, Troy and Adam asked me if I had
any substance abuse problems, and I told them I wasn’t into drinking or
drugs. “If I lose control, I feel like the person who comes out is
unlikable, so I try to stay in control,” I explained. And Troy slapped
Adam on the back and proclaimed, “See, I told you. He’s definitely a
sexaholic.”

I wasn’t sure whether he was referring to my self-control or my
self-esteem, but perhaps allowing myself to let go a bit would be good
for me.

James sucks a little GHB into the eyedropper, squeezes it into the
bottle cap, and gives it to me to drink in some sort of erotic swinger’s
rite. After fifteen minutes, I feel a gentle wooziness. And then I
remember something I’d meant to ask.

“As a guy, is this going to affect my, you know, performance?”

“Come with me,” James replies.

I follow him to a table where there’s a small medicine bottle filled
with a thin syrup. “This is liquid Viagra,” he explains. “It’s only
approved for testing on animals right now, but I got some online and
it’s great because you can measure out the exact dosage. Want some?”

“And there’s nothing else in it? It’s not going to make me trip or
anything?” I wonder why animals would want longer erections.

“It’s just going to help you have a really fun night.”

“Okay, but don’t give me too much. I don’t want to hurt anybody.”

He drops the Viagra into my mouth, and it tastes vile. We are ready to
swing. Basically, these guys are ravers but with sex instead of music.

I wonder what I’m doing to myself. I suppose back in the late sixties,
free love typically carried with it the implication of free drugs. And
at least this is much more fun than hanging out with the Tantra polys.
Perhaps all these subcultures, going back before drunken Roman
Bacchanalia, have their own pre-sex ritual, conceived as a way of
loosening inhibitions. I wonder why I was so resistant to the sacred
rites of the poly people, but I’m so open to the illicit chemical
concoctions the swingers are giving me. It’s definitely a moral failing
on my part.

We float into the hallway in a semi-euphoria and stop by a few very
unswinging parties until, finally, with the effect of the GHB already
fading, we cross to the Fantasy Tower of the hotel for the _Eyes Wide
Shut_ party.

Inside the two-bedroom suite, there’s a DJ, a stripper pole, and, in the
center of the room, a conspicuous round table with a white sheet over
it. Milling around are nearly three dozen shirtless men and women
wearing elaborate Mardi Gras masks. I’ve never seen more fake breasts in
my life, even in a porn film. Oddly, no one is having sex.

Near the entrance of the room, there’s a large cardboard box full of
costumes. Sage selects a black eye mask with colorful peacock feathers
protruding from the corners. I grab a white mask with a long _Clockwork
Orange_ nose and a jester cap on top.

“Let’s top off,” James says. He measures out a cap of GHB for each of
us. And then we wait. For something to happen. It seems like everyone’s
waiting. There’s an unacknowledged awkwardness in the room, like a high
school prom with no one on the dance floor.

Suddenly I hear a pinched, gravelly male voice. “Hey, man, it’s Neil
Strauss.”

I turn around to see an unmistakable figure in a red bathrobe and a
white mask. I can tell from his slinking posture and the stubbly,
well-shaped jawline beneath the mask that it’s Corey Feldman. “What are
you doing at my party?”

“This is _your_ party?”

I haven’t seen Corey, best known as the teen actor in _Stand by Me_ and
_The Lost Boys,_ in at least seven years. I first met him while I was
writing a book with Marilyn Manson, who had a minor obsession with
Feldman that mostly involved mocking him.

“What are you doing here?” he asks, equally shocked.

As I tell him I’m new to the scene, in my peripheral vision, I see the
blond enchantress from the club. She’s completely naked except for a
_Lone Ranger_ mask. She walks to the round table, turns around, sits on
it, and spreads her legs wide. She then scoots backward and puts her
feet up on the edge of the table, ratcheting her legs even wider. She
freezes there alone, as if preparing to suck the entire room into her
vagina.

“So are you just in it for the numbers?” Corey asks.

It’s a trick question. Men, it seems, like to test other men in this
scene to make sure they’re in it for the right reasons, whatever those
may be. Fortunately I’m not here to accumulate notches on my belt. “I’m
in it to find another way to live besides conventional monogamy,” I
answer.

“Then this is the ultimate extreme,” Corey replies enthusiastically.
Evidently I passed. In my peripheral vision, I notice a man approach the
table, drop to his knees, and bury his face reverently between the
blonde’s legs.

“Why is that?”

“Because seeing the person you love with someone else is the height of
passion.”

“Yeah, but usually the passion it ignites in people is murderous.”

“That’s the point: It’s something that’s hard to deal with. And normally
you would feel jealousy and anger. But if you can control it”—he presses
his hand palm-down from his heart to his crotch as if resisting a huge
weight—“and turn it into passion, it becomes a very connecting
experience.”

A chorus of grunts and groans fills the room, and I look up to see three
couples around the circular table. Two of the women are bending over the
tabletop as guys slam them from behind. Everyone must have been waiting
for someone with the courage to get the party started. However, it
doesn’t look like a giant swap meet or sex pile, just couples having sex
around other couples having sex. There was actually more swapping at the
puja. Perhaps the high of swinging for some is just being in an
atmosphere of sexual decadence.

Suddenly the second dose of GHB hits me. It’s not a gentle wooziness
like earlier but a more aggressive takeover of my system. I’m
light-headed, dizzy, and almost happy enough to actually want to do a
puja.

“I put that table there on purpose,” Corey says proudly, gesturing to
the couples copulating against it. “There was a glass one, but we had
them move it out and bring this one instead.”

I try to focus my brain and stop my eyeballs from spinning long enough
to respond, “That was, um, very thoughtful.” But for the life of me, I
can’t understand why a circular table is the key to an orgy.

“I know what I’m doing,” he replies immodestly. “I don’t do drugs, but I
make up for it with sex. Last night, I had sex with six different
women.”

Thinking back on my interviews with Feldman, he was also enmeshed by his
mom. In addition to making him rub her feet, comb her hair, and draw her
baths when he was a child, she used him to fulfill her own ambitions for
fame—going so far as to put him on diet pills when he was fourteen.

Rick would tell me that I’m in a sexual crack house right now. The three
signs of addiction, according to Joan, are that it’s chronic, it’s
progressive, and it has life-damaging consequences. I don’t think this
is chronic for me yet, but it’s definitely progressive. As for
life-damaging consequences, the night is still young.

A shirtless man sits next to us. His partner, a heavyset blonde with the
fake breasts that are evidently requisite here, unzips his pants and
starts giving him a blow job.

“Am I keeping you from joining in?” I ask Corey through the haze, hoping
to make my escape.

“No, I’m really picky,” Corey replies. He proceeds to tell me about a
night he and a girlfriend spent in Pamela Anderson’s hotel room,
unsuccessfully trying to seduce her. “Pamela Anderson has never even
made out with a girl before,” he continues. “Can you believe that? And
she told me that when she was on coke, so it must be true.”

My swinger pod appears next to us, and they seem antsy and ready to do
something crazy. “Don’t worry about me,” Corey says. “Go have fun.”

I mumble an awkward “nice seeing you again” and rejoin the group. I
instantly feel better now that I don’t have to hide the fact that I’m so
fucking high.

It’s time: This is an orgy I actually want to take part in, especially
now that I have a partner I’m comfortable with. And I can’t see myself
getting kicked out—especially since I know the host and there’s no
popcorn in sight.

I lean in to kiss Sage, but the nose on my mask pokes her in the face.
I’m not sure if it’s just the design of the mask or my dizziness. She
giggles and cocks her head to the side to avoid the obstacle. As her
lips approach mine, the feathers on her mask tickle my nose. I want to
lose myself in our first kiss, but I feel like I’m going to sneeze.

I pull back and the pointy extensions on my jester hat poke James in the
eyes. In the meantime, his mask is so elaborate that he can’t kiss
anyone. Sage and Chelsea start making out with each other, but their
masks jab Tommy and me, so we back away.

In _Eyes Wide Shut_ and every other movie with a decadent masked ball,
the guests intermingle with grace, fluidity, and sensuality. But in
actuality, it’s impossible to kiss anyone without multiple noses,
feathers, horns, and bells poking, tickling, and obstructing. The result
is more like a slapstick comedy.

“Let’s just take these stupid masks off,” Nicole finally says.

Real life is never like the movies.

17

As I start to remove my mask, Sage whispers to me, “Leave it on.” I’m
not sure whether I should take it as an insult or a compliment—probably
an insult—but I comply.

Sage grabs my crotch and starts rubbing me through my pants, so I reach
under her skirt. I hook my index finger inside her and, within minutes,
a hissing sound escapes from between her legs along with a stream of
fluid.

“She’s a squirter,” Chelsea exclaims. And suddenly everyone has their
hands on my date.

“I’m going to scout for a more comfortable place,” James offers.

As the GHB intensifies, I look up and see couples fucking everywhere.
Most of the masks are off now for practical reasons. As the swingettes
go down on the guys they’re with or sit on top of them, they’re doing
more than just having sex, they’re performing for everyone else in the
room.

James was right: This is much better than porn.

“I found a free bed,” James says. We make our way into one of the
suite’s bedrooms. I don’t know what’s about to happen, but between the
GHB, the champagne, the liquid Viagra, the copulating couples
everywhere, Nicole’s legs, Chelsea’s breasts, and Sage’s orgasms, I
couldn’t be any more turned on. I just wish there were some way to get
rid of the two guys. I don’t know what their expectations are.

I drop onto the bed, grateful for the softness. It soothes the
dizziness. Sage climbs on top of me and starts grinding against me,
while Chelsea strips down to just underwear and heart-shaped pasties.

Tommy and James are stuck standing awkwardly on the side of the bed, so
I slide over to make room for them. I don’t know why. I’m in the middle
of three scantily clad, ready-to-go nonmonogamous women. Why the fuck
should I care about these guys’ comfort? I would’ve paid every penny in
the bank for this experience ten years ago—if I’d known it was even
possible. Now, instead of enjoying it, I’m turning into a theater usher.

Chelsea lies on the bed, petite and golden with sculpted abs, her
pasties thrust toward the ceiling. “Take care of her for me,” Tommy
tells me.

“Define _take care_.” This is my first real swinger party, so I’m unsure
of the etiquette. I don’t want to start fucking her, then find out he
just meant to get her a pillow.

“Do whatever you want,” James explains. “You’re the lead sled dog here.”

“Just be safe, okay?” Tommy whispers in my ear.

They’re literally offering their girls to me. When I was learning the
game_,_ I worked so hard for an opportunity with just one woman like
this. Now there are three, and no stupid games and
will-you-still-respect-me-in-the-morning fears. I’m so intoxicated by
all the possibilities that I feel like I’m going to explode with
excitement, desire, gratitude, lust. Or maybe it’s just the GHB and
Viagra. I don’t know. I don’t care. It’s the closest thing to heaven
I’ve ever experienced.

“Wake up!” a male voice is yelling in my year. I think it’s James.

“I’m not sleeping,” I hear my voice say. “I’m not sleeping.”

I look up. My head feels like it’s stuffed with wet toilet paper. Fuck,
I think I passed out. Sage is sitting on top of me. Chelsea is on my
side. She whispers sensuously in my ear, “Can I help you with anything?”

That’s so hospitable of her. She’s like a Hooters waitress. “Do they
have food here?”

She leans in closer, her breasts rubbing against my chest, and says even
more sensuously, “Whatever you want.”

“Actually, just some water would be nice.” I smile gratefully.

She doesn’t go anywhere or even make a motion to get any water, because
clearly (at least to anyone not drugged up) she wants to help me with
something else. In the dimness of my mind, a brain cell starts to
illuminate: “Pasties,” I tell her. The word seems to expel from my mouth
in slow motion. She looks at me confused. “Those are nice pasties. Where
did you get them?”

Why am I making small talk? I should tell her I need help with my dick
or something. The regulator has come off my brain. This is why I don’t
like drugs. They make everyone cool but me. At least Sage is unzipping
my pants right now. That’s a reassuring—

“Wake up!” It’s that voice again, drilling into my ear.

“Why do you keep saying that?” I ask. My eyes focus in the direction of
the noise, revealing James again. I look up and Sage is still on top of
me, but she’s laughing.

“You fell asleep on her,” James tells me. “You were snoring.”

“You should be ashamed of yourself, falling asleep on a beautiful woman
like that,” Tommy chides.

“Are you joking?”

“No,” Sage confirms. “I was going down on you, and you fell asleep and
started snoring.”

I have absolutely no memory of falling asleep. That’s terrifying. Now I
see why this is a date rape drug. I want to ask how loudly I was
snoring, but I’m afraid of the answer. Instead, I stupidly ask her, “Did
I stay hard?”

“Yes.”

“Wow, that Viagra really works.”

I notice a line of guys standing against the wall in front of the bed,
just watching us. Not only didn’t I notice them before, but I haven’t
seen any other people being blatantly stared at here.

I peel myself off the bed and nod my head, trying to clear out the
toilet paper, which is whirling faster inside. I notice that my mask
isn’t on. I wonder where it went. James mumbles something I can’t
understand, but I can see he’s handing me a folded breath strip. Maybe
my breath reeks.

He starts to place it in my mouth, but it feels a little too intimate.
“I can do it myself,” I insist, taking it from him.

“Careful.” He guides my hands toward my mouth so I don’t drop it.

That’s two orgies ending in disaster. I’m like the orgy ruiner. The
saddest thing is, I got more action here asleep than I did awake. I
remember now another part of that article on GHB: The writer warned not
to mix it with alcohol.

As we start to leave, one of the guys who was watching earlier
introduces himself. “I run the Bliss parties,” he says. “I’m familiar
with your work. I think you’ll find this community very interesting.”

He points out another guy who was watching. “He’s actually here because
of your books.”

And I realize, that whole line of people against the wall—not only were
they watching me humiliate myself, but they know who I am. I tell myself
that maybe it’s cool to pass out at an orgy. Like I’ve been to so many
in my lifetime, they bore me.

The promoter starts talking to me about how he scouts talent for these
parties: He’ll go to clubs, watch couples and their dynamic together,
then selectively recruit them. “The formula is hot girls,” he explains.
“And as long as the guy isn’t a toad and doesn’t have a jealousy switch,
he’s fine.”

Perhaps this is my scene, I think as James pulls me away. Just being
able to go on a sexually decadent vacation like this a couple of
weekends a year would probably be enough to make monogamy bearable the
rest of the time. Kind of like the cheat day in a diet. This was
supposedly one of the functions of ancient ritualistic orgies as well:
to serve as a psychological release valve alleviating the pain of human
separateness.

“Should we go check out some other parties?” James asks.

“I think I’m done for the night,” I tell him.

“How are you going to get to sleep on E?”

“I’m just not gonna do any.”

“Too late for that.”

“What do you mean?”

“You just took some.”

“What?” How could I have possibly taken ecstasy? Unless when I was
passed out . . . But that would be fucked up, to dose me while I’m
sleeping.

“In the breath strip. I thought you knew.”

“I thought it was for my breath.”

“Don’t worry. It’s really pure. The only problem is that while you’re on
it, you can’t get it up. And it’s dangerous to mix with too much
Viagra.”

“Then why are we doing this?!” I’m starting to think James may be
completely crazy, like the Joker in _Batman_ comics. This makes no
sense. “Doesn’t that ruin the whole point of being here?”

“No, because the girls like it and they can still get turned on.”

“So how long is this gonna last?”

“Probably five hours.”

Oh god, what have I done?

18

We leave the room, take the elevator downstairs, and get on a moving
walkway. As soon as we step off, I feel it. I’m rolling.

I touch Sage’s back, then my hand moves up to her shoulder and starts
squeezing. I need to touch something solid. She seems irritated.

“What’s wrong?” she asks, shrugging my hand off.

Instantly my hand returns to her shoulder. Must squeeze. “I’m totally
rolling. Do you feel anything?”

“No.”

“Did you take any?”

“Yeah, but I’ve done a lot before.”

“How much is a lot?”

“Let’s just say I’ve done it rectally.”

We return to the central hotel and wander the halls looking for another
party James wants to check out. The carpet unrolls in front of my eyes.
I flash back to all the other times I’ve been fucked up in Vegas, and my
only memory is these hotel carpets. They stretch on forever in the same
repetitive patterns. Forever and ever. Endless. Carpet.

We arrive at a door. A shirtless guy opens it. There are glow sticks
everywhere, including two being spun by a short blonde with gargantuan
fake breasts.

“Take that jacket off,” the guy says. “You’re all wearing too many
clothes.”

We stand still, taking in the scene. There are glowing stickers affixed
to the walls, the stereo, the refrigerator, everywhere. In a bedroom
just beyond the entryway, there’s porn playing on TV. “Why do they have
porn at these things?” I ask Nicole. “It makes it unsexy. Like porn is
fake and this is real.”

“I don’t know why. It’s not classy.”

“They should play, like, CNN,” I go on. “That would be sexy. Because
we’d look at the TV and think, Look at those boring people. We’re having
so much more fun than them. They’re all dying and shit, and we’re, like,
fucking each other’s wives.”

When some people get fucked up, they become the life of the party.
Others get aggressive or promiscuous or overemotional. I just get
neurotic and nerdy. Especially on psychoactive drugs, when all the
filters come off. This is who I am. I need to accept it, even if no one
else can.

“Do you want to walk around?” Sage asks.

I clutch her arm. “Stay with me!” With my other hand I’m hanging onto
the edge of a table for dear life. “I don’t want to go in there. There’s
porn!”

“Then what do you want to do?”

I’m losing it. I need more anchoring. “Can you put your hands on my head
and, like, do something?”

She cups my bald head in her hands like it’s a fragile egg.

“No, like, _knead_ it.”

She starts kneading it. I feel more anchored.

“Don’t stop doing that,” I order her. And as her warm hand massages my
scalp, I wonder if I’ve already found it: my nonmonogamate. From the
moment Nicole introduced us, it felt like I’d already known her.
Actually, I _had_ already known her. But the point is, we’ve been
floating through this experience together like a couple that’s already
in a comfortable relationship. And she hasn’t been possessive around
Chelsea and Nicole at all. Maybe I’ll ask her to move in with Belle and
me. She already has experience. This is perfect. She’s perfect.

Maybe this is just the ecstasy talking. I have to get a grip on myself.
Need to make sure I don’t get carried away, profess my undying love for
her, and scare her off. It’s too soon. I’m probably rebounding. She’s
probably rebounding. Everything is rebounding.

I notice a portly guy in an undersized T-shirt passed out on the
couch—missing out on everything and oblivious to it all.

“You have to be pretty high to pass out during an orgy,” I tell Sage.
“What an idiot.”

She looks at me like I’m crazy. And I am. I’m way too high.

James says we’re leaving. I have no idea why we’re going, but I know
it’s the right thing to do.

We walk out with Sage still kneading my head. I don’t know why we’re
still looking for after-parties. We are six ecstasy-breath-strip eaters
in the prime of our sexual lives. We are the party. I tell them that.

“I’m totally feeling it,” I tell Nicole as Sage continues to knead my
head.

“I know,” she says.

I wonder how she knows. Is it that obvious? “Why isn’t anyone else this
high?”

Nicole smiles at me sympathetically.

“Fuck, I’m that guy, aren’t I? I’m such an amateur.” Another wan smile.
“Hey, if you aren’t doing anything, can you knead my head? It’s
important right now.”

As we continue through the hall, I don’t want these two women to remove
their hands from my head. I can’t feel my teeth. The ecstasy is getting
stronger. I tell them.

“It’s kicking to another level.”

“It’s okay,” Nicole says soothingly, as if to a child afraid of thunder.

And so we follow the carpet in silence. Always the carpet. Unrolling
into infinite corridors. No beginning. No ending. No escape.

Finally, a door appears. It opens. A wooden floor inside. Yes.

We enter. I am still being kneaded. This is good, because my body is
feeling less and less substantial.

I see a couch across the room. It is soft. It is beckoning. It wants me.

“Should we go to the couch?” I ask my head-kneaders.

Then I worry that maybe they think I’m trying to get them into some sort
of sexual situation there. “No, no, that would be bad,” I add quickly.
“Maybe we should stay here.”

Then I remember that getting into sexual situations is the whole reason
we’re here. “No, no, okay. Let’s go to the couch.”

We walk to the couch and sit down. Much better. We’re lounging
comfortably now. It would make a nice photo. “Maybe we should take a
picture,” I suggest. “Where’s the camera?”

“I’ll get the tripod,” Tommy offers a little too eagerly.

Suddenly, a scenario of him snapping away while we all have group sex
flashes through my head. That’s the last thing I need on the Internet.
Even if he just posts it on his social networking profile, if it’s
embarrassing enough, other people will share it, blogs will pick it up,
and it will spread far and wide until it’s my top Google hit.

In a world in which everything is connected and archived, your mistakes
live longer than you do.

“No, no,” I say. “Never mind.”

“Let’s all have some chocolate, then,” Tommy suggests. “You’ll love it.
It’ll be the most sensuous experience you’ve ever had.”

He breaks squares off an exotic chocolate bar and gives one to each
person. A hot chocolate experience is what I need right now, to ground
me. But when I put it in my mouth, it feels wrong. I don’t have a body,
so eating something that’s supposed to go through my digestive system
makes no sense. I just feel it floating uselessly in my mouth, like an
X-ray in which you see a coin in someone’s stomach.

“This isn’t working for me,” I say, spitting it into Sage’s free hand
without warning her. “I can’t eat. My body can’t process food right
now.”

She looks at me, then looks at her hand, and says nothing. I think this
was the last straw for her. I was starting to think that I no longer had
to take this journey alone, that I’d have Sage at my side as a
primary—coming with me to meet Anne in Paris, planning the Father Yod
house with Belle and me, and going to dinner with Rod and Charles to
show them that happiness can be found outside the socially accepted
norm. But I just spit partially masticated, mostly melted, saliva-filled
brown goo into her hand.

“We should drink orange juice,” I suggest. “The vitamin C intensifies
the high.” That’s the last thing I want to do. I have no idea why I
mentioned it. Either I’m trying to fit in or my prefrontal cortex is
even more jacked up than Daniel Amen thought. Maybe I need to go through
chair work again. No, I definitely need to. Whatever I’m doing, I don’t
think it’s healthy. Unless this _is_ my authentic self. That would be
pathetic.

Chelsea and Tommy are talking about their honeymoon. They’re inviting
Sage and me to come along on it, like we’re a couple.

“You should totally use my place in St. Kitts,” I tell them. The country
gives citizenships to people who purchase certain properties, so I spent
an entire book advance buying an apartment there for some paranoid
reason I can’t connect to right now. “And I’m not just saying that
because I’m on ecstasy. I really mean it.”

They laugh. They don’t believe me.

“Really,” I insist. “I’ll send you an email tomorrow confirming it.”

There’s an awkward silence. I _am_ that guy. My words echo in the room,
loud and shrill. Everyone just wants to have sex and all I hear is my
voice saying, “I’m such a lightweight.”

“Am I being funny or annoying?” I ask Sage. I don’t really want the
answer. I just want reassurance that she still likes me and I’m not
making a total ass of myself. Sage looks at me as if she’s too scared to
reply.

“Or a bit of both?” I offer, to make it easier for her to respond.

“Yes,” she says, smiling wanly. “A bit of both.”

The words cut me like a knife. Yeah, I think, I guess I am a fucking
awkward loser deep down. So I’m going to cover up for that fact by
making out with these two girls sitting next to me.

That thought pretty much summarizes the last decade of my life.

I make out with Sage. I make out with Nicole. I feel a stirring in my
pants. I turn and tell James, “That thing you said about
ecstasy—fortunately it’s not true.”

“What are you talking about?” he asks.

“That’s okay.” Fuck, everyone’s annoyed with me. I’m the worst guy to
ever bring to an orgy. I’m about to get kicked out of this one too.

“I’m tired,” Sage says. She stops massaging my head and slouches into
the sofa. I can’t let this happen. If she sleeps, we’ll disconnect. I
won’t have her as my safety. She must stay awake.

There’s only one way to save her. I start rubbing her through her
panties.

“Your fingernail is digging into me,” she complains.

Why’s she being so moody and oversensitive? I’ve been nothing but nice
to her—if anything, too nice. And then I realize that I’m on ecstasy,
completely oblivious to reality, and my finger probably _is_ digging
into her. I stop instantly.

“Wanna see Chelsea ride the Sybian?” Tommy asks.

“Sure.” Who doesn’t want to see a beautiful woman have an earth-shaking
orgasm on top of a mechanical saddle?

Tommy starts unpacking his bags of toys. He’s equal parts traveling
salesman and sexual Santa Claus, pulling out dildos, lubrication, and
attachments. Something exciting is going to take place and I have a
front-row seat.

There’s only one problem: my head. It needs attention and reassurance.

“Can you just knead my head again while we watch?” I ask Sage.

“I should really go,” she responds.

Fuck, I completely ruined this. Me and my stupid head. We’re scaring
away the nonmonogamous love of my life. But we can salvage this: “I’ll
walk you to your room.”

“No, it’s okay. I can get there by myself.”

Or maybe we can’t.

She seems to have turned on a dime tonight, from sexual and fun-loving
to cold and cranky. It really takes a special talent to be capable of
making someone who’s on ecstasy, the love and empathy drug, be repulsed
by you. I feel vanilla. So fucking vanilla.

I had it all tonight. And I lost it.

“I’m gonna go back to my room too,” I announce.

“You sure you don’t want to stay and watch?” Tommy asks. He seems more
disappointed that I’m leaving than he was when Sage said she had to go.

“I should go to bed before the sun comes up.” I turn to Nicole, who not
only made this adventure happen but has been so patient with me, and
tell her, “You’ve been a really great host and guide through all this.
And I’m not just saying that because I’m on ecstasy right now.”

“Thank you.”

She sounds dismissive. Maybe she doesn’t believe me. How can I convince
her that it’s not the drug talking, it’s me? I know.

“Really. I’ll send you an email tomorrow confirming it.”

As I try to get to sleep that night, I wonder if James purposely dosed
me as revenge for the laundry room incident. Maybe he intentionally
planned to humiliate me in front of his girlfriend and everyone else.

When I wake up, I get my answer. On my phone, there’s a text from him.
It was sent at 5:13 A.M., after I left. “Dude,” he writes, “wish you
were in our bed right now. Next time we need some time with just the
three of us.”

Evidently, all is forgiven. And he didn’t intentionally humiliate me. I
did it to myself.

“Now when you go to hell, you know what it’s going to be like,” Rick
says when I conclude my story about Bliss.

We’re sitting on the porch of his house, drinking ginger tea. Like Rick
himself, the environment is still, peaceful, serene. It is everything
Las Vegas isn’t. “But there’s a positive side to it,” I tell him. “These
people have figured out a way to have their cake and eat it too. They’re
in intimate, loving relationships, but instead of having affairs and
compartmentalizing, they’ve chosen to have their sexual adventures
together.”

“They don’t know what their cake is! They’re operating purely out of
addiction, habit, and trying to fill a void. Only a very sick person
would go to Vegas in a-hundred-and-ten-degree heat. It’s a desperate
place to begin with, and this sounds like a low-self-esteem convention.”

Rick is like my conscience. And right now a conscience is the last thing
I need. Whenever I close my eyes, I see flashes of the carnival of
sexuality I glimpsed, and it gives me hope. Hope that the skeptics are
wrong and there are plenty of nonmonogamous functional adults in the
world, women who I’m emotionally and physically and intellectually
attracted to, women who don’t call themselves priestesses and talk to
aliens, women as cool as Sage.

As soon as I returned home from Bliss, I emailed Chelsea to confirm the
offer to honeymoon in St. Kitts and I emailed Nicole to confirm that she
was a good hostess—just to prove I really meant it. And Nicole, hostess
that she is, said she wanted to throw me a dinner party in San Francisco
to introduce me to more friends of hers in the scene.

“Don’t forget that the goal was to see which path leads to happiness,” I
protest to Rick. “Whether or not this scene is right for me, at least
it’s leading me in a happier direction. I don’t feel constantly guilty
anymore. And I’m not hurting anyone.”

“Except yourself,” Rick responds. “You’re doing drugs that aren’t good
for you, that you don’t even like. And look closer at what happened. A
root problem surfaced while you were high: You discovered that you live
in a reality where you don’t feel good about yourself. And sex, for you,
is a drug to temporarily escape from that feeling.”

“You may be right. But sex addiction treatment didn’t solve anything. I
feel like these experiences are bringing me closer to something true and
honest. So I’m going to just keep following my bliss and seeing where it
takes me. This is all completely new and it’s only been a couple of
months, so of course I’m going to make mistakes.”

Rick shakes his head. “I think you should have stayed in rehab.”

After leaving Rick’s, I call Adam to check in. Though I don’t miss group
therapy, I do miss some of the guys in it.

Adam tells me that his marriage has gotten worse. “I’m like a whipping
boy. I’m pretending I’m happy, but I’m really not happy at all. It
always seems like she doesn’t want to be with me. I asked her when was
the last time she asked how I was, and she couldn’t even remember.”

What’s incredible is not that Adam had an affair, but that he hasn’t had
another one.

When your wife is tired of making the effort to understand you, when
she’s fed up with hearing the same stories coming out of your mouth,
when she holds so much resentment that it poisons every conversation,
when she’s nicer to telemarketers than she is to you, when the only time
she’s passionate anymore is when she’s criticizing you—that’s when you
want a mistress. Someone whose eyes glisten with attraction when she
looks at you, whose ears perk up when you speak, whose hands crave the
feel of your skin, whose thighs moisten when you kiss her—someone who
actually appreciates your presence and treats it like a gift instead of
a punishment. Someone who will see you the way your wife once saw you
before she grew so fucking sick of the sight of you.

As Troy put it when I asked him why he, of all people, cheated: An
affair fills you back up when the marriage empties you.

“Doesn’t she realize she’s setting up the exact scenario that led you to
cheat in the first place?” I ask Adam.

“I know,” he sighs. “I could live without the sex, but you need to at
least feel like someone likes you. It’s been over a year and she won’t
even come to church with me. She’s still making me go over every detail
of the affair. And, you know, whenever I check my email, everything’s in
the _read_ folder because she’s already gone through it all.”

“That’s a horrible way to live—for you _and_ for her. You know what
Lorraine calls it?”

“No.”

“Pain shopping. She’s not getting healed by that. She’s just getting
retraumatized.”

“That’s exactly what she’s doing. Even my dad’s upset. He says he feels
sorry for me. He can’t believe I’ve stuck around this long in the
marriage.”

“So why don’t you leave?”

The frustration in his voice fades to resignation. “There’s a part of me
that just can’t do it, you know. I will sit here and take a beating for
the rest of my life rather than divorce. Because of the kids.” They’re
fourteen and sixteen years old. “I’m here to serve them. Maybe that’s
what it comes down to.”

This can’t be what marriage is like for most people: two aging
individuals chained together in escalating resentment and indifference.
If human beings are the culmination of some sort of plan—be it
evolution, a divine spark, or an alien polyamory experiment—then why
weren’t we built to get along better with those we choose to create a
family and perpetuate the species with? Unless we’re doing it wrong.

“But do you really think you’re serving your kids by staying together in
an unhappy marriage?” I challenge Adam. “What kind of relationship are
you modeling for them?”

As he dances around the question, I start to understand why Adam’s story
gets me so emotionally worked up: because I _am_ his kids. I was raised
by parents who rarely got along and who brought out the worst in each
other. Yet for some reason, they never divorced. So I grew up hoping
they’d separate and find partners who made them happier. Perhaps I’m
trying to get closure by encouraging Adam to do what my father never
could.

“So what am I missing in group?” I change the subject. “Any interesting
updates from the other guys?”

“I’m not supposed to say anything, but you should really call Charles.”

20

Gathered around the table at a Mexican restaurant in the Mission are not
just couples in the Lifestyle, but also leather families and other
non–New Age poly people who Nicole and James want me to meet. I’ve been
trying to call Charles all week to no avail, so in the back of my mind
I’ve been playing out horrific scenarios of what could have happened to
him.

The moment I arrive, Chelsea greets me with a powerful kiss on the lips.
Shorn of her Vegas club wear, she looks prim and domestic. Stiletto
heels, a tight dress, false eyelashes, and well-applied makeup are
perhaps the closest thing to true magic in this day and age, able not
just to transform a woman but every man around her—regardless of her
looks, because ultimately men are more attracted to sexual availability
than they are to beauty.

Tommy, with his spiky hair and untucked, fitted dress shirt, looks the
exact same as he did in Vegas. In fact, he may be wearing the same
clothes. Seated next to him is a large, charismatic gentleman named
Stefanos, who’s dressed like a Prohibition-era gangster. Nicole tells me
that he films weekly fetish parties at the San Francisco Armory, which
was bought by a porn mogul and turned into a huge labyrinth of film sets
for a kink website.

As I look around the gathering, I feel like I’ve arrived at the
threshold of something big, something I’ve been looking for my whole
life.

“Have you talked to Sage at all?” Nicole asks me.

“No, have you?” She never even gave me her phone number.

“I haven’t heard from her since Vegas.”

She must have had a horrible time. And I was really falling for her too.

Though, of course, I was on ecstasy, so I could have just as easily
fallen in love with a particularly shiny doorknob.

I choose the sole empty seat, which is next to James, and ask him about
the text he sent at the end of that night. I’m still not sure whether he
was hitting on me or offering Nicole to me, but I soon find out that it
was the latter: “I was abandoned by my father, so I want the approval of
other males and I do it by sharing my hot girlfriends with them.”

His words surprise me, and I realize there’s more to swinging than
anything I’ve read about it before. I always thought that, for men, the
Lifestyle was about fucking other women. But for guys like James, it’s
also about showing off the woman they love: _Look what I got. And she
loves me, so I must have value. And if you treat me with enough respect
and admiration, I will share her with you—but not too much, because I
don’t want to lose control of her. That would cause me to feel pain and
question my fragile sense of self-worth._

Maybe Rick was right, I think as James continues to hold court.

“If I were gay, I’d be so fucking happy,” he’s saying, “because all I
want is the love of other males. When Nicole and I dated another girl
for a while, the best part wasn’t the threesomes, it was walking into a
club with two hot women and getting the male admiration.”

Suddenly, the way the guys thrust their girlfriends on me at Bliss makes
a lot more sense. Swapping is the ultimate in male bonding.

I tell them I’m going to Paris next week and ask if they have any
connections in the Lifestyle there.

“They take it to a whole new level in Paris,” James tells me. “Our
friends call it switching, and it’s not really a couples thing. It’s
more open than that. There’s a girl in the scene we’ll hook you up with.
She’s a writer, too, and she’s gorgeous.”

“That would be fantastic,” I tell him. As I do, I notice Tommy and
Chelsea staring at me and whispering to each other.

“Don’t get fixated on the idea that swinging is your only option just
because it’s all you’ve experienced,” a quiet, authoritative voice warns
from the end of the table. I turn to see the only dinner guest I haven’t
spoken to: a sharp pale creature with long black hair, a black choker,
and soft, vacant eyes.

He introduces himself as Pepper and identifies himself as a
queer-friendly Goth who’s into poly and S&M. Just as it did in rehab,
one diagnostic label seems to work like a magnet, attracting others
until people can’t introduce themselves without sounding like they’re
reading a grocery list.

Pepper tells me his parents were in an open relationship. After
unsuccessfully trying monogamy, he followed in their footsteps. Today he
lives with his primary of eight years, has two secondary girlfriends of
four years each, and is dating four tertiary lovers. His primary
girlfriend has just one other lover, who she wants to move into the
house, and Pepper is cool with that.

This is love in the era of having it all.

“So are there any specific rules that help things work for you?” I ask.

“People who have been doing poly or any kind of nonmonogamy for years
tend to have intents rather than rules,” he replies. The distinction
resonates well with my punished inner adolescent. “For me, the intent is
to be respectful to my partner’s partners and not to do something that
might trigger my partner’s jealousy.”

“How do you handle jealousy when it does come up?”

“Once fear of loss is taken away, you get past jealousy.” He speaks in
an almost academic monotone, with very little feeling. Maybe the reason
jealousy isn’t a problem for him is that he wasn’t born with a full
emotional range. “For example, if someone breaks up with me, I know it’s
because the relationship is no longer working between me and them. It’s
never because they found somebody better, since the monogamous contract
has been replaced by a new contract that doesn’t involve someone having
to make a choice between two people. They can have them both.”

“I like that way of thinking,” I tell him. “But for people who didn’t
grow up in an environment like yours, I think the old contract is hard
to change. Some of my married friends would find it easier to cheat than
to openly sleep with someone else, because if their wife knew what they
were doing, they’d feel like they were hurting her.”

“It actually takes most people a couple of years to work through those
powerful feelings of guilt and disloyalty,” Pepper responds. “So I’d say
the most important thing for you as you expand your relationships will
be open and honest communication with your partners.”

Like when I first met Lorraine, I trust Pepper as an authority—even
after I learn that his last name is Mint. He’s a walking glossary of
terms that I’ve never heard before. He tells me about the _burning
period,_ which is the length of time (usually two years) it takes
couples who open up to deal with the issues and challenges that occur as
a result. I learn about _the joys of theoretical nonmonogamy,_ which is
when two people say they’re in an open relationship—but instead of
actually sleeping with other people, they just get to feel free knowing
they have the option to do so. There’s _the jealousy test,_ which you
pass if you’re able to have a serious relationship with someone who’s
sleeping with other people or in love with someone else. Then there’s
_fluid bonded,_ which refers to partners who feel safe having
unprotected sex with one another, and _veto power,_ which means that one
partner can ask another to end an outside relationship—an agreement that
Pepper feels can cause more problems than it solves. Finally, there are
the wearisome _cowboys_ and _cowgirls_ who get into the poly scene, date
someone’s partner, and then try to rope that person into a monogamous
relationship.

I learn more in a half-hour conversation with Pepper than I did at the
entire polyamory conference. After dinner, I thank him for the advice
and make sure to get his phone number.

“It’s a shame,” Tommy remarks as the dinner party breaks up. “We barely
had time to catch up.”

“I know, but I’ll be back soon.”

“What are you doing later tonight? We thought we’d give you a chance to
watch Chelsea ride the Sybian, since you missed out in Vegas.” He
delivers the invitation casually, as if offering a breath strip laced
with ecstasy.

As attractive as Chelsea is, there’s something about Tommy that makes me
uncomfortable. Maybe it’s because he’s been trying to push his fiancée
on me since the night we met. It’s the equivalent of someone constantly
pestering you because he wants to give you free money: After a while,
you start to feel he has a hidden agenda. Then again, I’m here to
observe alternative relationships, and this is definitely an opportunity
to do so up close.

“I have to drive home early tomorrow,” I respond. “Let’s see what
happens.”

What happens is that Tommy invites himself back to the apartment I’m
renting for the weekend. And I don’t protest.

21

Tommy and Chelsea arrive outside the apartment in a mostly windowless
white serial-killer van. After parking, he hauls out the briefcases and
bags I saw in his room in Vegas. He opens one briefcase to display a
collection of dildos that range from medium pink to ginormous black.
There’s something sinister about two men standing in the street at night
and staring into a box of phalluses.

“Are those the toys you sell?” I ask to break the awkward silence.

“Rent,” he corrects me.

“You _rent_ sex toys?”

It’s quite possibly the worst business idea I’ve ever heard. You’d have
to be a pretty fearless swinger to want a used sex toy that’s had
someone’s possibly diseased juices all over it.

“We clean and disinfect them after each use, of course.”

“Of course.”

As Tommy explains his business, I start to understand that he’s not in
it for the money. The real payoff is that he’s constantly hired to
attend sex parties, where he sets up shop like a traveling medicine
show, encouraging women to test the toys until the room turns into a
XXX-rated Tupperware party. His used sex toys, as disgusting as they
sound, are the equivalent of Kamala’s pujas: the spark to the gas of
anticipation.

After hauling his gear into the living room, Tommy tells me that
everything’s ready. And that’s when I realize: I don’t know this guy at
all. I don’t even know how well Nicole and James know him. In Vegas,
Chelsea did say that they were new to the scene.

He opens a bag filled with extraordinarily unsexy gadgets that look like
they were stolen from a 1950s research lab. Their sole purpose, he
explains, is to give varying degrees of electric shocks to masochists
looking for a new type of pain. He also has a duffel bag filled with
varying lengths of thick black nylon rope. The whole array is like
something out of a horror film. For all I know, I may have just invited
serial killers into the house. Swinging psychopaths.

The crown jewel of his collection is the Sybian. Priced at more than
thirteen hundred dollars, it’s the Cadillac of sex toys. He spreads a
blanket on the floor as if we’re about to have a picnic or roll up my
dead body in it. He carefully places his Sybian on it, then tops the
saddle with a small rubber-ridged pad that has what looks like a large
pencil eraser sticking out of it.

From another briefcase, he removes several meticulously folded squares
of plastic wrap, opens one, and places it on top of the pad. I have no
idea if plastic wrap is an effective barrier against pathogens, but
fortunately I won’t be sitting on it.

Chelsea hikes her skirt and straddles the Sybian.

“Look at that ass!” Tommy urges me.

Thanks to my dinner conversation with James, I understand that this is
my cue to give him the male approval he needs. “A work of art,” I tell
him.

“You control it.” He gestures to a small square box with a dial that
goes from zero to a hundred. It sits on the floor, attached to the
Sybian by a black cord.

I slowly bring the vibration level up to twenty-five and, as the pad
moves in faster and smaller motions than anything the male finger is
capable of, Chelsea starts moaning. The sound is an intoxicant.
Instantly, blood rushes from my head, where all common sense and caution
reside, to my loins, where nothing but instinct and the moment live.

As I slowly bring the dial to thirty, her body flushes and she tilts her
head skyward as if seeing the face of God. Whatever she’s feeling, I’m
jealous of it. I don’t think I’m biologically capable of experiencing
that kind of pleasure—unless there’s a Sybian equivalent for men,
perhaps some sort of jelly-filled, soft-walled vacuum cleaner that keeps
saying you’re the biggest and best it’s ever been with.

Tommy kneels behind Chelsea and massages her back and shoulders,
occasionally adding a resounding slap on her ass. “Why don’t we switch
places?” he turns to me and suggests after a few minutes.

This appears to be a routine they’re running. They know exactly where
the night’s going—and I hope it isn’t anywhere that involves tying me up
and using the dildo collection. I’m sure these two could get just about
anyone alone and vulnerable with their whole “Wanna see my girlfriend
use an expensive sex toy?” routine.

I give Tommy the controls and watch as he brings it up to fifty. It’s
violently fast, and Chelsea is thrown into an altered state of pleasure.

“You can touch her if you want.”

I cautiously rub her back and arm through her blouse. She grabs my hands
and smashes them onto her breasts as the Sybian takes her higher.

Tommy lowers the speed so that Chelsea can remove her shirt and bra,
then dials it up until it’s at a hundred and Chelsea’s fake breasts are
firing like pistons. I can’t tell anymore whether she’s moaning from
pleasure or pain. But when Tommy starts cycling it down again, the word
“more” escapes from Chelsea’s gorgeously open mouth. The skin on her
face and chest bursts with every shade of pink. Suddenly her hand lunges
like a cobra and grabs my crotch through my jeans.

I glance at Tommy for permission so he knows that whatever is going on,
it’s being done with respect for him. “She’s too much for me,” he
responds, nodding like we’re bros in this adventure together. “She once
came fourteen times in one night. That’s why I appreciate what you’re
doing.”

Despite all the Vegas decadence, I’ve never had sex with another man’s
girlfriend in front of him. This is about to be my first actual swing—or
half-swing.

After a few more minutes, Chelsea dismounts and lies on the bed. Tommy
grabs a length of rope from one of his bags. I back away just to be safe
and watch as he ties Chelsea’s hands together over her head.

“Do you have any latex gloves?” Tommy asks afterward.

When I tell him I didn’t happen to bring any, he gives me a condom and
tells me to put it on my pointer finger so I can touch her. This is free
love in the twenty-first century. It’s hygienic, electronic, and
sanitary.

After an old-fashioned manual orgasm, Chelsea asks softly, almost
meekly, “Which one of you wants to enter me?”

“You didn’t get to go last time, so it’s your turn,” Tommy says
magnanimously, like she’s a ride at an amusement park.

“That’s okay.” I shouldn’t be doing this. It feels compulsive,
impulsive, even slightly repulsive. All the pulsives.

I massage Chelsea’s chest for a few minutes, stalling for time. As she
grinds her hips and moans, I snap back into the moment: Fuck it. Why am
I holding back again? He _wants_ me to have sex with her. It would be a
personal insult to both of them if I didn’t. That’s why they’re here.
Besides, I’m trying to have free relationships that don’t hold anyone
back from these types of adventures. This is exactly what I told
everyone from Joan to Ingrid that I believed in: sex as an end in
itself.

So I ask him for another condom.

“Is it okay if I film it?” Tommy asks.

“No!” I scream instinctively. That’s the last thing I need leaking all
over the Internet.

“Why?” he asks, as if my answer makes no logical sense whatsoever.

“Let’s just savor the memories.”

As I try to get myself back in the mood, I start to worry that he has a
camera hidden somewhere. Technology gets smaller and easier to conceal
every day.

“You haven’t been filming, have you?” I double-check.

“No sir,” he says. “But I have been recording audio.”

I thought I was starting to understand the swing scene, but this makes
absolutely no sense. What the fuck is he going to do with the audio
recording? Play it in the car on long road trips?

“Can you turn it off?”

“Are you sure? Sometimes I like to listen back to the moans.”

This guy is a freak. I absolutely should not fuck his Barbie doll
girlfriend who’s spread-eagled naked in front of me.

So I pull my pants down just low enough to get my dick out without
showing too much ass and skin, in case there is a hidden camera
somewhere, and enter her.

As I thrust inside, Tommy props a pillow against the wall and lounges
there, watching. “Do you like the way it feels?” he asks her. “Do you
like the way he’s fucking you?”

“Mm-hmmm,” she articulates.

I assume he’s trying to stay involved and in control in some way. I try
to tune out his voice, to shut his form out of my peripheral vision, to
move faster and lose myself in Chelsea.

“Wow, look at you go!” he exclaims. “It’s like a jackhammer.”

Now he’s commenting on the whole thing like a fucking sports announcer.
I ignore him and start grinding my pubic bone against her clit to turn
her on again.

“That’s interesting,” Tommy says. “I haven’t seen that one before. Is
that your style?”

This is a terrible time for a discussion about technique. “I don’t know.
Just improvising as I go.” It’s not easy fucking someone while trying to
carry on a conversation with her fiancé. It’s like trying to race a
motorcycle while texting.

Tommy’s silent for thirty blessed seconds or so, then he unties Chelsea
and announces, “Condom check.”

I’m worried he wants to feel it to make sure it’s still on. So I reach
down, confirm that it’s completely snug, and tell him everything is in
order.

“Show him that thing you do with your hips,” he instructs Chelsea, who
lifts said hips and starts moving rapidly up and down along my shaft.

When I flip her over, Mr. ESPN goes, “I like that. That’s a good one.”

He doesn’t appear to be getting turned on by watching. He seems more
like a detached observer studying gorilla mating habits. And every time
I change positions, he makes a new comment as if he’s on the verge of
some evolutionary discovery. Hopefully this isn’t narration for an audio
recording.

It’s time to pull the curtain on this show. I force myself to come,
careful not to make a sound in case Tommy’s recording.

Relieved that it’s over, I pull out, remove the condom, drop it onto the
floor, and lie next to Chelsea. As I stroke her hair and try to enjoy
the afterglow, Tommy, of course, pipes up and ruins the moment. I can’t
make the words out exactly, but they sound like, “Let’s see the juice.”

“What do you mean?”

“I need to see the condom so I can make sure it caught everything.”

I want to ask him how he’s going to know whether or not it caught
everything. Maybe he has a semen-measuring scale in his duffel bag that
he uses to weigh the load.

I fish around the floor for the rubber and hold it up so he can see. I
really don’t want him touching my used condom.

“That’s good,” he approves. I put it back on the ground and silently
pray he doesn’t collect it before he leaves and put it in a formaldehyde
jar in one of his briefcases.

Tommy returns to Chelsea’s side, kisses her softly, and tells her, “I
adore you, honey.”

“You were incredible,” I compliment her—for him.

As they lie there, I make swinger pillow talk and ask them how long
they’ve been doing this. They’ve been dating for five years, they tell
me. But a year and a half ago, they put an ad on Craigslist and selected
a guy, then went to his house and she gave him a hand job. She gave the
next guy a blow job. Finally they found a swinger couple on the
Lifestyle Lounge, but Chelsea became sick with jealousy while watching
Tommy ravish another woman. It took a dozen swings until Chelsea became
comfortable enough to let Tommy interact with other women again.

Their story reminds me of Tahl’s and Lawrence’s. If you want to open
your relationship, then proper etiquette is required: ladies first.

I bid them good night and invite them to crash on the pullout couch if
they want.

As I lie in bed, I reflect on my experiences with Chelsea, Nicole, and
their friends. Swinging is the best alternative I’ve seen so far. And I
like the way some of the couples form long-term intimate relationships
with other couples, becoming both best friends and lovers. But I’m not
like Tommy or James or Corey Feldman. I don’t get off on seeing other
guys sweat on my girlfriend.

I’m sure there are just as many men who are in the Lifestyle simply for
their own sexual gratification and variety, and willing to tolerate
letting their wife screw another man in exchange. But if sex becomes
just a service to be traded, that’s not freedom. It’s commerce.

Ultimately swinging is a traditional relationship with an escape hatch,
a way to experience Helen Fisher’s dual reproductive strategy without
deception. If monogamy is like only being allowed to eat at home, as I
told Joan, then swinging is like being allowed to eat wherever you want
on the condition that your partner approves of the restaurant and eats
with you.

It’s still a form of possession, only the chain is extended a few feet
longer. In fact, if the way guys like Tommy talk about their girlfriends
is any indication, partners are actually treated more like possessions
than in monogamy.

Perhaps it’s time to create the world I want rather than trying to fit
into someone else’s scene, to go in all the way on freedom, to finish
building my free-love dream house. With luck I’ll find the rest of the
people I’m looking for in Paris. I’m running out of time: Belle is going
to be here in just five weeks.

22

While driving back to Los Angeles, I try to reach Charles again. This
time, he answers the phone.

“Are you okay?” I ask. “I’ve been worried about you.”

“I’m sorry,” he answers in a quiet, halting voice. “I’ve been out of
town. My whole world turned upside down and I’ve been trying to make
sense of it.”

“What happened?”

“I found out my wife’s been cheating on me.” He raises his voice. “For
the past twelve years!”

I’m so shocked I’m unable to form an articulate response. We were all so
busy trying to earn back the trust of our partners in rehab, we never
even considered questioning _their_ integrity.

The story Charles goes on to tell is fragmented. But as best I can piece
it together, he was looking at his wife’s phone when a text arrived from
a security guard at her office building. It read, “I gave you my heart
for twelve years.”

Just to make sure he was interpreting the message correctly, he texted
back: “One thing’s for sure, we definitely had great sex together.”

“Yes,” came the reply, “I miss it.”

Digging for more, Charles texted: “Do you remember the first time we did
it?”

“In your car.”

Charles kept pain shopping: “That’s right, I sucked your cock.”

And the security guard responded, “You don’t talk like that. Who is
this?”

At this point, Charles was shaking with an emotion beyond pain. He let
the conversation drop, and obsessively went through his wife’s phone and
emails. Soon, he pieced the backstory together: nearly every afternoon,
his wife and the guard had been sneaking off for a lunchtime tryst—for
more than half their marriage.

“Oh my god, how did you react?” I ask. I’ve known people—mostly love
addicts—who would be less hurt if their spouses died than if they
cheated. They’d even prefer the former, because at least they couldn’t
take it personally. But Charles’s response is the last one I’d expect.

“The release was impossible to describe.”

“Because you were so angry?”

“No, I was relieved!”

“You’re kidding.”

“Neil, all my shame and guilt just melted off me.” He pauses. “When she
found out I’d relapsed, she threw me under the bus, like she was so
pristine and perfect. She told all our friends that I’d betrayed her
again and I was this terrible sex addict. She locked me out of the house
and threatened to take everything I had and turned my own family against
me. And I’ve felt so bad about myself for so long.” His voice begins
trembling. “But what she was doing . . . I just don’t understand how she
could be so cruel.”

I wonder how many other people go through years of sex addiction therapy
and meetings trying to make amends, only to find out their partner has
also been cheating. Or even worse, they never find out and go to the
grave thinking they’re a sinner and their partner’s a saint. One of the
unfortunate axioms of human behavior is that what others shame people
for the most is usually what they’re doing in secret themselves. After
all, an accusation is much more powerful than a denial: It’s a way to
seem one up when you’re really feeling one down.

“So are you going to stay in recovery?” I ask.

There’s a long silence on the other end of the line. “Well, I went away
for a few days with my sponsor to cool down and determine the right
thing to do.” A deep inhale. “And I’m going to get divorced.” A long
exhale. “And then I’m going to start fucking something every day.”

This is not the Charles I’ve come to both pity and admire. It’s a side
of Charles I’ve never met. And so I get the chance to tell him a version
of what he’s been telling me for the last year: “That can’t be what your
sponsor recommended. It sounds more like your disease talking. Be
careful.”

“Neil, I’m a fifty-year-old man who’s free of a twenty-two-year-old
marriage, half of which was a total lie. I just want to . . . I don’t
know. I don’t know what’s true anymore.” A heaving sob explodes into the
phone, followed by the muffled sound of crying.

Some people live in an endless on-and-off relationship with control.
Either they’re trying to exert it over their lives—by getting obsessive
about a diet, a belief system, a phobia, a hobby, a need for order, a
twelve-step program—or they’re completely out of control, making a mess
of their lives. And it sounds like Charles is on the verge of a mess.
The shadow he’s been repressing has broken loose. And I can relate: So
has mine. But as any good Jungian therapist will tell you, you’re not
supposed to repress the shadow in the first place. That’s when bad
things happen. The goal is to integrate it. And I hope that’s the path
we’re both ultimately on.

I want to ask Charles if he still thinks he’s a sex addict or if he
thinks his wife is one—or if he thinks the disease was contagious and
she caught it from him. But now is not the time to prove a point.
“Whatever you decide to do,” I tell him instead, “make sure you process
it in group first.”

“I will,” Charles says, stifling his tears. “So how are you feeling
without Ingrid in your life? Do you miss her?”

It’s the one question no one’s asked. And in the moments of decadence,
connection, and extreme awkwardness with the swingers, I’ve managed not
to think about her. But in every other moment, I’ve felt her presence
somewhere—in my mind, my heart, my home, my conscience.

“Constantly,” I tell him.

23

Everywhere I look while traveling to Paris, I see young couples pushing
sleeping children in strollers, carrying blanket-wrapped babies in their
arms, hurrying along superhero-backpacked toddlers. Each family makes me
think of Ingrid and the future I ruined. I wonder what Ingrid’s doing,
who she’s doing it with, and if she’s happier living without my
wandering eyes and ambivalent heart. One of the many hazards of breaking
up is that it takes years not just to find love again but to discover if
it’s real, stable, and sustainable.

In Paris, however, everything will change. I will find the rest of my
pod. And maybe, just like several little-t traumas add up to one big-T
Trauma, several little-l loves can add up to one big-L Love.

First, there is Anne. She’s waiting in the hotel room when I arrive.
She’s slender and toned, with dirty blond shoulder-length hair, minimal
makeup, and boyish clothes. As I approach her, she looks deeply and
mutely into me with quivering brown eyes. I take a step toward her,
brush her hair aside, and we kiss.

We disrobe. Get in bed. Make love. Spoon. And then she says _salut_.
It’s the first word we’ve exchanged.

Then, there’s James and Nicole’s friend, Camille. “Hi Neil. I’m meeting
my friend Laura, who’s American just like you,” she texts. “She wants to
go to a great switch club and I promised I’d get in trouble with her. Do
you want to come with us?”

“Is it okay if I’m with a date?”

“Dump the girl. There’ll be plenty of dates for you there! And they all
want to have sex :)”

This switch club sounds like a goldmine of open-minded single women. The
only problem: I _want_ to bring Anne.

“If you have to bring her, use the ‘We’ll just have a drink and watch’
technique,” Camille relents. “That’s how my boyfriend got me there in
the first place, and look at me now! The club is by Montmartre. Give me
a call after dinner.”

In my relationship this last year, my credo was to say _no_. Only by
saying no to others could I protect Ingrid’s heart. But now, I am saying
_yes_—to everyone, to everything, to life. Because every _yes_ is the
gateway to an adventure. Whatever I am heading toward, it is a
relationship that operates out of a place of _yes._

At dinner that night, I do exactly as Camille instructed. Anne and I are
with two women I met on a European press tour a few years earlier: a
German fashion photographer and a Swedish designer. They spend most of
the meal gossiping about people I don’t know.

“We don’t have to do anything,” I explain to Anne. “Let’s just plan on
having a drink and watching, and we can leave right away if it’s lame.”

“I’m a little tired,” she replies, her voice barely audible. Throughout
the day, she’s barely spoken. Instead, she’s attached herself to me
energetically, gazing at me almost constantly with big, vulnerable,
barely blinking eyes. I get the sense that she wants something from me
or may already be getting it from me. “Is it okay if I go back to the
hotel?”

“Can we come?” the fashionistas interrupt.

“You can go with them if you want,” Anne tells me softly.

It’s hard to read Anne. I’m not sure if she’s legitimately tired or just
uncomfortable with the suggestion. “Are you sure it’s all right for me
to go?”

“I don’t mind,” she replies.

I study her face to make sure she’s sincere, that it’s not a test to see
if I’ll choose her. She appears placid and unconcerned. I ask three more
times just to make sure.

“She said you could go!” the German photographer snaps at me.

_Yes,_ it turns out, is not an easy principle to live by. I wonder why,
after knowing Anne for just a day, I already feel like it’s wrong to do
this without her. Perhaps the problem is not that the people I date want
to possess me, it’s that after sex I give them ownership out of guilt.
I’m replaying an enmeshment script, pathologically accommodating to
monogamy. If I truly believed that sexual possession was wrong and acted
accordingly, I wouldn’t have agreed to an exclusive relationship with
Ingrid in the first place and would have saved us both a lot of grief.
In life, whoever has the strongest reality wins. Lose your moral
certainty and lose the ground you stand on.

We drop Anne off at the hotel, and she gives me a deep kiss and walks
off. It’s a good sign: Letting your lover go to a sex club alone is
actually a much more open-minded feat than going with him. As the taxi
speeds away, the German photographer loops her arm in mine.

I’m determined not to wreck this orgy like all the others. My stomach is
full, so I won’t be snacking on popcorn. And I haven’t touched a single
mood-altering substance, nor do I plan to. I even clipped my nails.

We arrive at the club just after midnight. I spot Camille instantly. She
has long brown hair worthy of a shampoo commercial and skin so smooth
and flawless that a metaphor to an inanimate object, like a pearl, would
hardly do it justice.

She’s standing with two other women: Laura, her American friend, who
looks like a burning candle—long and narrow, with a white pantsuit and a
shock of short blond hair. And Veronika, a haughty beauty from Prague
with lips like cylindrical sofa cushions, flowing brown hair, an
overdeveloped nose, and a tall, thin, sensuous frame that reminds me of
the actress Jane Birkin.

“Do we have to put on robes or towels when we go in?” I ask Camille,
unsure what protocol is for places like this.

Camille looks at me like I’m crazy. “No, we just wear our clothes.”

That’s a relief. Despite my desire to be open, evolved, and shame free
about sex, I’m still not totally comfortable with the sight of my own
body. The first time I ever had sex, I was too embarrassed to remove my
shirt. And the second and third times as well.

Behind us in line, there’s a Frenchman with a shiny suit and
slicked-back hair. He looks like a shady businessman who snorts a lot of
cocaine. “Since you have so many girls, is it okay if I come in with
you?” he asks.

The club has a rule that all males must enter with a female—and I’m
standing there with five of them like a glutton. I suppose this is what
I missed when I was dating Ingrid: options, variety, adventure,
discovery, novelty, the unknown. As Lorraine would put it, intensity.

“I don’t know,” I tell him. “It’s my first time here.”

As we wait, Camille and Laura discuss sharing toys, by which they mean
boys. “Is your boyfriend coming?” I ask Camille.

“No.”

“Does he know you’re here?” I’m asking not to judge her, but because I’m
curious how their relationship works.

“No.” She smiles guiltily. Clearly, having an open relationship is no
cure for infidelity. First Nicole, then Sage’s story about her
ex-boyfriend, now Camille. Perhaps the problem with most relationships
is that the rules start to become more important than the values they’re
supposed to be representing.

Eventually two of Camille’s toys arrive, both in designer jackets and
skinny ties. They introduce themselves as Bruno and Pascal. Bruno looks
like a clean-cut college athlete, while Pascal, with thin-framed
glasses, tight curls, and slow, well-mannered gestures, looks like an
intellectual dandy.

Unlike the highly sexualized crowd at Bliss, the men and women here
aren’t divorced weekend warriors dressed like porn stars. Aside from the
slick-haired businessman behind us, they’re all young, hip, well
dressed, and silicone free. They don’t look much different than the
crowd outside an exclusive nightclub. Evidently, after a night on the
town, they come here for dessert. As the line starts moving, Laura takes
pity on solo slick guy and invites him to come in with her.

“Do you know how I can tell these people are barbarians?” the German
photographer says to her friend. “Look at their shoes. I wouldn’t wish a
single pair on my worst enemy.”

It seems I make a critical mistake at every orgy, and the fashionistas
may be this orgy’s ruiners. But it’s too late to slip away from them:
We’re being let inside.

When we enter, a hostess asks us to check our jackets (which for some
reason leads to sniggers from the fashionistas), then gives me a card
that she explains will serve as my tab for the night. Veronika removes
her blazer to reveal a loose-fitting backless dress that, when her
stride is long, would get her arrested. “She will be my first fuck
tonight,” Pascal tells me confidently as I stare mutely at the tan
expanse of Veronika’s back.

We walk downstairs to an empty, low-lit dance floor dotted with stripper
poles. The twenty or so people in the room are clustered against a bar,
drinking away their inhibitions. Katy Perry’s “I Kissed a Girl” is
playing. It seems so . . . obvious.

At the end of the anteroom, there’s a black door that leads to the fun.
After her friends have drifted into the rooms behind it, Camille takes
my hand and offers to show me around. “What about my friends?” I ask.

“They’ll be fine. Are you coming or not?”

I look over and they seem deep in snide conversation, concealing their
discomfort by increasing their arrogance. I should invite them to join
us, especially since I brought them here. The last thing I want to do,
however, is walk around the orgy with them making obnoxiously loud
comments about how everyone’s sexual techniques are so last year.

I feel guilty leaving them behind, just as I left Anne behind. But I
say, “Yes.”

24

Behind the black door, Camille and I slowly wander through sunken living
rooms and small porthole-fitted chambers, all in copious use, until we
arrive at a space that consists of just an enormous bed and a narrow
walkway along the front wall.

Most of the women on the mega-bed are completely naked while the men are
still wearing dress shirts, ties, and pants. However, their pants are
all unzipped or lowered and their junk is hanging out. Dicks are
everywhere. Even the guys who aren’t with women are walking around the
room with expectant cocks dangling in the air in case someone has a need
for them. I’m the only guy who’s zipped up. Until Bliss, I’d rarely seen
a guy naked before. And here, with more people in less space, it looks
like a snake pit.

In the bottom right corner of the bed, Laura is on all fours with her
dress up. Bruno pulls out of her and parks in Camille’s mouth while
Pascal, true to his word, fucks Veronika against the wall. She’s
standing up, facing frontward with one leg raised and her face flushed,
in a pose that, if photographed, would incite a million sticky nights.

I don’t know what to do, how to get involved, or what the rules are. At
least James and Nicole explained what was happening at Bliss and made
sure to include me. But here it’s much more extreme: the closest to a
free-for-all I’ve ever seen.

I sit in the empty space on the mattress in front of Laura, who’s still
posed on her hands and knees expectantly. “Thanks for letting me come
here with you guys,” I tell her, because I feel like I need to say
something.

“Is this your first time at a switch club?” she asks astutely. This is
probably the stupidest place I’ve tried to make small talk since the
last orgy.

“Pretty much.”

As we’re talking, the creepy businessman from outside the club
materializes behind Laura and rubs her pussy. Then he scoots under her
like he’s repairing a car and starts eating her out.

“Is that cool with you?” I ask her. “I can tell him to stop if you’re
not comfortable.” Here I go again: taking care of everyone’s needs but
my own.

“That’s so American of you to say,” she laughs.

“What do you mean? How is that American?” I don’t even understand the
comment: She’s American herself.

“No one’s ever asked me that before.”

“But I thought maybe—”

“I just want a cock in me.”

This is the kind of woman I fantasized about as a teenager: an
indiscriminate one. And more than even the pujas and Bliss, this seems
like free sex—because there’s no spiritual baggage, drug baggage, or
even much relationship baggage around it. In fact, there’s no baggage or
encumbrances whatsoever, just randomly intersecting body parts. And now
that I’m in the midst of it, I’m terrified. It’s so shockingly . . .
open.

It’s not society that holds us back, it’s ourselves. We just blame
society because not only is it easier but it’s a nearly impossible
weight to move. This way, we don’t actually have to change. I thought I
was fighting the system, but all I’ve really been doing is fighting
myself: first my compulsions, now my inhibitions.

Meanwhile, the slick-haired guy stops licking Laura and appears to be
going for a home run.

“Can you make sure he puts on a condom?” she asks.

“Okay,” I reply overenthusiastically, grateful for the opportunity.

I have a job to do now. A purpose. I am the condom police. I watch him
carefully to make sure he puts the rubber on. Then I worry that I’m
creeping him out. But I won’t be swayed from my very important duty: no
protection, no service. _That’s right, sir, roll it on all the way.
Otherwise I’m going to have to ask you to step out of the bed._

“It’s on,” I tell her with an air of authority,

As he thrusts inside her, Laura’s face swings closer to mine. Now’s my
chance, I think, and I start making out with her.

And that’s when I realize: No one else here is making out. How many
dicks has she had in that mouth tonight?

So I pull away. It’s time to say _yes_ and unzip. I kneel so that my
crotch is level with her head. And sure enough, the power of the
cock-right-there-in-front-of-the-face is too strong to deny. She takes
it in her hands, guides it into her mouth, and starts sucking.

I realize this is very crude, but the story takes place in a sex club.
What else am I supposed to describe? The chandeliers? There’s nothing
going on here but sex.

“What do you like?” Laura pauses to ask.

Good question. I like _this_. What’s better than a blow job? Or does she
want more specific instructions? Perhaps they have names for different
blow jobs here—the spit-shine, the round-the-world, the confused
American.

Like anything, I suppose sexual freedom is a learned art. I still need
more experience to get comfortable.

Suddenly, I see Pascal’s head appear over mine. He whispers in my ear,
“Veronika wants you.”

It’s music to my ears, especially since things with Laura feel awkward.
I know she has an any-cock-will-do attitude, but I have a sneaking
suspicion that my cock isn’t quite doing.

When the businessman finishes, Laura makes her escape. But instead of
Veronika appearing, Camille kneels in front of me and takes Laura’s
place with more enthusiasm. I’m not fully present because I’ve been
stuck in my upper head, so I look around the room and notice an
exotic-looking woman lying in front of me. I take her hand and start
massaging it, and she massages my hand back. I move my hand between her
thighs and start playing with her. She’s soaking wet. Good thing I
clipped my nails.

I’m starting to get comfortable here. Finally, I’m actually part of an
orgy—awake, accepted, alive. I rear up tall and look around. Everyone is
fucking and sucking.

Perhaps my previous disasters in the swing and poly scenes have actually
been necessary experiences to get comfortable at these things, learning
lessons on the road to orgy mastery.

Suddenly I hear a guy’s voice exclaim loudly, _“Tu es sur ma jambe.”_

Nearly everyone on the megabed starts laughing.

Evidently I’m kneeling on some guy’s leg. I slide out of his way and
notice Veronika crawling toward me on the mattress. I drink in her
unique amalgamation of devastating beauty and awkward innocence, and I
instantly harden.

I make out with her passionately. I don’t know why I keep touching
people’s filthy lips, but I crave the intimacy and connection more than
the anonymous sex. Maybe I am polyamorous—because it’s not just free sex
I’m searching for, it’s free romance, free connection, free
relationships, free
getting-naked-with-someone-you-enjoy-and-who-enjoys-you-and-then-getting-to-know-each-other-even-better-afterward.

I seriously need to gargle with Listerine when I leave this place.

Meanwhile, Bruno has appeared out of nowhere and started having sex with
the exotic-looking woman.

I pull back and look at Veronika’s face, and she bites her lower lip in
response. There’s so much heat between us and we’ve only just met. I
hope it isn’t because she was abandoned by her father.

I run a finger across her lips and she sucks it into her mouth and . . .
oh god, I feel like I’m about to . . .

But I don’t want this to end, so I pull out of Camille’s mouth.

“Let me suck you!” she begs.

This is the best night of my life.

The scene on this bed is basically what Muslim martyrs are promised in
the afterlife, except with virgins. But paradise is here. Now.

I’ve finally entered the world I’ve been reading about in porn magazines
and watching in adult movies since puberty. Just as women are trained by
the media and society to look for their Prince Charming, men are
conditioned to look for their nasty slut. Not for a marriage, but just
for an adventure. Both are fairy tales, but a Prince Charming is nearly
impossible to find, because it’s a lifetime illusion to sustain. It
takes only a few minutes to play the role of nasty slut.

The only thing keeping me from fully enjoying this sexual paradise is
the guilt: that Anne is in the hotel worrying, that the fashionistas are
angry, and that because I’m liking this so much, it means I’m a sex
addict, as is everyone else here. The counselors at rehab have really
done a number on my head. I used to be worried just about sexually
transmitted diseases, but they’ve turned sex itself into a disease. And
now, any time I’m giving myself over to pleasure, I hear Joan’s voice in
the back of my head telling me I’m avoiding intimacy.

Just as I promised Rick I’d go all in on addiction treatment without
doubt, I need to go all in on freedom without guilt. The answer will
become clear over time: Either I’ll hit bottom, as Charles predicted, or
I’ll find a solution that works for my life, as I hope. I need to get
out of my head and be present for this experience. And to remember why
I’m here: not to have a lot of sex, but to find my relationship
orientation and like-minded partners.

As my eyes meet Veronika’s again, I notice a dick hanging in my
peripheral vision like a cloud covering the sun. Its owner says to me in
a thick French accent, “All the girls here, they have been sucking your
dick.”

“I guess so.”

“Do you like having your dick sucked?”

It seems like an obvious question, but I reply anyway, “Yes.” I try not
to make eye contact. This conversation definitely isn’t helping my
staying power.

“Would you like that I should suck your dick?”

“Oh, no thanks.” I don’t know why, but the situation seems to call for
politeness. “I’m good.”

I suppose if I technically wanted total freedom, I’d let him go to town.
But, I realize, the goal isn’t sexual anarchy. It’s that I want the
rules around my sexuality to be self-imposed, not externally imposed.
That’s the key difference—perhaps in everything.

The goal, then, is liberation: to be the master of my orgasm. I don’t
want my partner to own it, which would be monogamy, but I also don’t
want the orgasm to own me, which would be addiction.

My new admirer has inadvertently given me a gift. Though he doesn’t say
anything else, I keep seeing his dick—on my right side, then my left,
then a foot above me—as if he’s hoping that by just dangling it around
me, at some point I’ll decide to show my appreciation. That seems to be
how things work here. Maybe this is where all the women hang out who
actually like it when guys text photos of their dicks.

A Valkyrie with long blond hair and missile breasts clambers onto the
bed with her boyfriend. I eye-fuck her to get back into the spirit of
the orgy. She holds my gaze. But before I get a chance to do a thing
about it, Bruno appears out of the blue and starts fucking her.

I don’t know how he does it. This must be his tenth woman. Suddenly I
remember that Camille has been down there sucking me for half an hour
straight. I put on a condom, lie down, and move her on top of me.

Camille rides me as Veronika positions herself over my face. I am
smothered in woman. If this is happening right now because my mother
smothered me, then I owe her a serious thank-you.

Suddenly, a loud, condescending German voice fills the room: “Where is
he?”

I tilt my head back and see an upside-down image of the fashionistas
standing against the wall, staring into the mass of bodies.

“It’s just like him to do this to us!”

I try to shield myself underneath the women so the fashionistas don’t
spot me.

“Let’s just leave without him.”

Their voices cut through the room, killing all sexuality in their path.

“So selfish.”

For a millisecond, I consider stopping. I should probably get back to
the hotel and check on Anne anyway.

Then I think, No. This is amazing. I don’t want to stop this. So I’m
selfish. Let me be selfish. They can leave and I’ll deal with it later.
I’m learning how to take care of my own needs for a change.

In moments like these, the true nature of one’s soul is revealed.

“Let’s switch,” Veronika suggests. This is a switch club after all, so I
slide out of Camille so she can swap places with Veronika. However, as
soon as Camille’s lower orifice is free, Bruno is in there. The guy
never misses an opportunity. I’m sure he’s a great businessman in the
outside world.

Veronika slides her body over mine, her skin rubbing against my
clothing, her back arched so we can see each other’s faces. I switch
condoms and slowly enter her. We move against each other sensuously.
Time slows. We fall out of sync with the rest of the club and into each
other.

I gaze deeply into the world in Veronika’s eyes and she into mine—and it
feels like love. Not the love that is a thought that comes with
expectations of commitment and fears of abandonment, but the love that
is an emotion that makes no demands and knows no fear. I’ve found, for a
moment, love in a swing club.

Connected sex is a spiritual experience, but not in the way the Tantra
polys describe it. It is spiritual because it’s a release from ego, a
merging with the other, a discorporation into the atoms vibrating around
us, a connection to the universal energy that moves through all things
without judgment or prejudice.

Thus, orgasm is the one spiritual practice that unites nearly everyone
on the planet, and perhaps that is why there’s so much fear and baggage
around it. Because they were right both in rehab and at the puja: It
_is_ sacred.

And every orgasm. Is in itself an act of faith. An attempt to reach out.
And just for a moment. Relieve our separateness. Escape from time. And
touch eternity. And, yes!

As she drenches the mattress, I fill the condom.

Not only did I find love at an orgy, I think I found enlightenment.

25

“Should we go get a drink?” I ask Veronika as we slide off the bed. What
we really should go get is a shower.

“I need a cigarette,” Camille says, crawling away from Bruno, who
quickly slips away, no doubt looking for another business opportunity.

Back in the lounge, I no longer feel guilt. Not about the experience,
which was incredible. Not about Anne, who is responsible for her own
decisions. Not about the fashionistas, who chose to remain separate from
everyone and are probably back at their hotel talking shit about how the
birthmark on my left ass cheek looks like a fake Gucci symbol or
something.

We walk upstairs to a smoking room, and Veronika and I finally have a
chance to talk. It’s like the perfect date in reverse: first have sex,
then get to know each other.

She’s a lapsed visual-arts graduate student with a fiercely independent
streak, a passion for learning new things, and a light melancholy worn
under her skin for insulation. She speaks in a thick Czech accent,
clipped and blunt. There’s a coldness in it that probably comes from
generations of ancestors who froze and starved and suffered and survived
against all odds so that she could be here today, fucking a bunch of
strangers in a trendy Paris club.

“It was my first time,” she tells me. “I liked it.”

“You mean you haven’t been here before?”

“No. I’m visiting a guy in Paris. I told him I was only coming as a
friend, but when I wouldn’t have sex with him, he got angry. Camille
lives next door, so she said she would take me out tonight without him.”

“You don’t want to sleep with him, but you had sex with all these random
guys?”

“This is for the experience. That guy is too pushy. He threatened to
kick me out when I wouldn’t kiss him today.”

“If you want, you can stay with me. I’m here for a few more days.”

“I would like that,” she says, unsmiling yet smiling. As we continue
speaking, I’m reminded of a line from a classic sixties song: “I could
be in love with almost everyone / I think that people are the greatest
fun.”

And this is what I’m discovering since leaving Ingrid. Whether it’s
Nicole or Sage, Anne or Veronika, each woman is a wonderful world unto
herself. And monogamy? It’s like choosing to live in a single town and
never traveling to experience the beauty, history, and enchantment of
all the other unique, wonderful places in the world. Why does love have
to limit us?

Perhaps it doesn’t. Only fear is restrictive. Love is expansive. And I
wonder, since fear of enmeshment impels us to avoid commitment and fear
of abandonment makes us possessive, what type of evolved relationship
can emerge once those wounds are healed?

For the first time, Ingrid is starting to recede in my mind, to become a
beautiful memory, a heartrending casualty from my misguided attempt at
monogamy. In front of me, a world of endless relational and sexual
possibilities is opening up. Behind me, a struggle is ending. Even if
someone is your perfect match, it’s unlikely to work if your core values
are different.

When Veronika mentions a documentary she recently saw called _The
Workshop,_ about a retreat in which participants get naked and have
group sex to heal their shame and find enlightenment, I decide to tell
her about the poly house I’m putting together.

“That sounds fun,” she replies and rests her head on my shoulder. “I’d
be interested in trying that with you, depending on when you do it.” My
heart races. If things work out after spending more time together, I
just may have a V.

The rest of Camille’s friends soon surface and we part ways outside the
club, all exchanging numbers. When I return to the hotel, Anne embraces
me—not with fear or relief or jealousy or worry, but with acceptance.
She nuzzles happily into my shoulder and whispers, “I want to be an
experienced woman.”

And that’s when I realize I’ve done it: I’m living in a world of
liberated women and free sexuality. It’s becoming my lifestyle. My
reality. I am finding my tribe.

Now it’s time not just to have sex with multiple partners, but to build
intimate relationships with them also. Time to find out if this way of
life is truly sustainable for me and can lead to a better kind of love,
a stronger kind of family, and a fuller sense of happiness.

_D_eep in our nature, we are foragers. And life is a process of
gathering the resources we need from a large, connected planet. It’s all
out there: every color, shade, flavor, and mutation of life and
experience. Whatever we are looking for, we will find—if it doesn’t find
us first. However, the result will not be what we’re consciously looking
for, but what we’re unconsciously seeking.

And so what we want will never be anything like what we expect. It is
the forager’s law: You can find the berry bush, but you can’t control
its yield.

I leave Paris with plans to live with three lovers: Anne, who was
overjoyed at the prospect of being together again so soon; Veronika,
with whom I spent three blissful days in Paris after Anne left; and
Belle, who has stayed in constant contact this whole time. I had met
each of them under adventurous circumstances that went well, so it
didn’t take much for them to agree to continue the adventure.

I wonder what Shama Helena would call this relationship. It’s one too
many people for a V. I guess it would be a quad—or a one-legged W, maybe
a tridactyl foot [image]. Whatever the case, I’m excited to finally turn
the corner from observing nonmonogamous relationships to being in them.

Since I’m walking into the unknown, I do my best to prepare. I speak
with the three women almost daily after returning to Los Angeles,
getting to know them better. And with each text and call, the connection
grows and blossoms. It has the feeling of a new romance, filled with
hope and expectation, unsullied by reality. It’s clearly premature to
move in together, which is why we’ve agreed to try it for two weeks
initially to see how it goes. It’s a shame I ruined things with Sage,
because she’s the only woman I’ve been with so far who has experience in
a group relationship like this.

Because the guesthouse I rent is too small for four people, I call the
owner of the big, dilapidated tree house I looked at with Rick when I
was dating Ingrid. Unfortunately, it’s not available, so I scout for
other options, sending the girls photos of my favorite places.

“Why don’t you just do it here in San Francisco?” Nicole suggests when I
fill her in on my plans. “There’s no place in the world more tolerant of
alternative relationships. All those books on polyamory you’ve been
reading—most of those authors live here. And I can get you into all the
underground parties.”

Nicole has been my Beatrice in this new paradigm and she hasn’t let me
down yet. I think she enjoys taking on the role of alt-relationship tour
guide to fresh recruits. So I agree to try this new relationship
somewhere new.

A few days before Belle, Anne, and Veronika are scheduled to arrive, I
find a decently priced vacation rental near Fisherman’s Wharf. It’s a
two-story apartment with three bedrooms, which will allow each of my
sort-of girlfriends to have her own room, closet, and bathroom. Ideally
the women will build corresponding relationships with one another and
we’ll all end up sleeping in the same bedroom. But in a worst-case
scenario, I can just spend the night with each separately in a regular
rotation, which is presumably how most polygamists do it.

Veronika is scheduled to arrive first; Belle’s plane lands seven hours
later; and the following afternoon, Anne gets into town.

So it’s with equal parts astonishment and anxiety that I wait for
Veronika at the airport, preparing to turn what seemed like an
impossible relationship fantasy into a daily reality. Eventually, I see
her emerge from customs. She’s two inches taller than me and probably
thirty pounds lighter, wearing high heels, skinny jeans, a tight yellow
T-shirt, and the soulful sadness that never leaves her eyes. Her accent
cuts strong and seductive through the crowd, with trilling _r_’s that
make me think of a Cold War spy.

Three hours later, we’re lying in bed, content in the afternoon light of
San Francisco, having a postcoital talk about body language. I try to
take a snapshot of the moment in my heart so I can remember the
exhilarating feeling of having gone from strangers to lovers to domestic
partners in a matter of weeks. If I’d stayed with Ingrid, I never would
have gotten to experience this.

My phone beeps with a text from Anne, who says she’s packing and looking
forward to holding me. I text her back and let her know that the girls
and I are looking forward to holding her too—just to remind her that, as
Orpheus put it, this is about family. A few minutes later, Belle texts
to let me know she landed on an earlier flight and has “vajazzled”
herself for me. I have no idea what that means, but I tell her it sounds
hot and we’ll come pick her up immediately.

When Belle responds that it’ll be easier for her to take a cab to the
apartment, Veronika sighs, exasperated. She gets out of bed, wraps a
towel around her body, opens her suitcase, and starts hanging clothes in
the closet. There is a light violence in the sound of each hanger
hitting the brass bar.

“What’s wrong?” I ask.

“Nothing.”

“Nothing always means something. I’m open to talking about it.”

“I’m fine, really.” She unpacks her toiletries and brings them into the
bathroom. A gentle frost accompanies the breeze of her every movement.

“Fine stands for fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.”

She is unamused. “It’s disrespectful to keep texting girls when you’re
with me,” she snaps.

And I think: She’s right. Then I think: I’m fucked. There’s only one
woman in the house right now and we’re already having jealousy issues.
The exhilarating feeling of domesticity disappears instantly. But this
is what I’m here for: to be in reality about this lifestyle. It’s easy
to have sex with other people’s wives and girlfriends, but learning to
actually be relational (as Joan would put it) with multiple partners is
far more challenging because it’s not just body parts intersecting, it’s
feelings. Anything goes in a switch club between two strangers, but here
in the real world as two lovers, everything now means something.

So I need to choose my next words carefully and with maturity if I want
the experience to go well. Because it’s not just about a couple of
weeks, it’s about my future. “I was texting to make arrangements with
the girls who are coming to stay with us,” I tell her. “But from now on,
unless we’re making plans for that day, let’s all try to ignore the
phone when we’re together so we can be in the moment with each other.”

She nods and smiles, content with the diplomacy. I used to think that a
good relationship meant always getting along. But the secret, I realize,
is that when one person shuts down or throws a fit, the other needs to
stay in the adult ego state. If both people descend to the wounded child
or adapted adolescent, that’s when all the forces of relationship drama
and destruction are unleashed. I share this with Veronika and teach her
about the different ego states. Soon, we’re connected again.

“I’m already learning things from being here, and that’s why I came,”
she says happily.

An hour later, Belle arrives. She’s pale and petite, wearing a plaid
skirt, a navy blue cardigan, a white blouse, funky red glasses, and
braided honey-blond pigtails. It’s a schoolgirl look designed to drive
men wild with both lust and guilt simultaneously.

“Is this your den of sin, Mr. Strauss?” she asks playfully as we embrace
in the doorway.

I lead her to the living room to meet Veronika. Then I leave them alone
for a few minutes and give them a chance to get acquainted without me.
After a while, I hear laughter. A good sign. I return and Veronika tells
me she’s going to take a walk.

As soon as she leaves, Belle jumps in my lap and starts removing my
clothes. I assume they worked out an arrangement between themselves.
Already, the impossible is happening here.

Women like Chelsea put an extraordinary amount of effort into trying to
look like the doctored photographs they see in magazines. But more
exciting and more forbidden than that impossible feminine ideal is the
nakedness of tender flesh that should not be uncovered, skin so pale and
thin that it seems like exposure to light and air will damage it, flesh
that seems to tremble all on its own simply from being looked at.

This is Belle’s body.

It is marred only when I discover what she means by vajazzle: It’s a
bedazzled vagina, with brightly colored sequins stuck where pubic hair
used to be. It’s as pointless as it sounds.

Minutes after we get our clothes back on, Veronika returns. I watch her
face and movements carefully. She doesn’t seem upset.

We get ready for dinner, then walk downstairs to my Durango, balancing
on a thread of unity. That thread threatens to snap as soon as we get to
the car, where I encounter the first challenge of a group relationship.

Both women stand in front of the passenger door bristling with anxiety,
waiting for me to make a decision.

“Since we didn’t pick Belle up at the airport, she should sit in front,”
I tell Veronika. “Then you can have the front seat on the way home.”

It’s embarrassing to hear these words come out of my mouth. It sounds
like something my father might have said to my brother and me when I was
twelve. I don’t remember anyone teaching multiple-partner seating
arrangements at the World Polyamory Association Conference.

I get the sudden feeling that nothing about this experience is going to
be like I expected. I am living under the forager’s law.

Belle sits at dinner in her schoolgirl outfit, gawked at by every
pervert in the restaurant.

“Oh my god,” she’s saying, throwing back her third drink of the night.
“I went on a total lingerie shopping spree before I came here. I want to
model it _all_ for you tonight.”

Normally, this would be ideal dinner conversation. However, there’s a
problem: She’s looking only at me when she speaks. In fact, she’s acting
as if Veronika isn’t even at the table. I can sense the frost beginning
to coat Veronika’s skin.

When Veronika goes to the bathroom, I remind Belle, “Make sure you
include Veronika when you talk.”

“I don’t care about her,” she responds. “I only care about you.”

Her words floor me. “But that’s not why we’re in San Francisco. We
discussed exploring polyamory here, and that means more than just the
two of us are involved.”

“I know.” She sighs and stares at her drink, like a child disciplined
for doing something she knew was wrong in the first place.

Bringing lovers together can evidently be like introducing cats.
Everything must be done with care, thought, and precision, otherwise
they’ll never get along.

After dinner, I take them to a speakeasy in the Tenderloin called Wilson
& Wilson, hoping a change of scenery will foster more camaraderie. But
with every cocktail, Belle gets more talkative and Veronika gets more
irritated, until she’s looking at the table when Belle talks. And
avoiding eye contact with people is worse than directly telling them
they annoy you: It’s your soul telling their soul that it annoys you.

This is already teetering on the brink of disaster, and Anne hasn’t even
arrived yet. Father Yod seemed to live in harmony with fourteen
different wives at his peak, so surely I can make things work with just
two.

I flash back to rehab. The guys in my group were all very different, but
what enabled us to form deep connections quickly was discussing our
timelines and childhoods. Maybe it’s time to end the small talk and
really get to know one another.

“I’m curious,” I say to Belle, changing the subject. “What were your
parents like when you were growing up?”

“They were perfect. They loved me very much.” She takes a sip of her
cocktail, then looks up at us, a big red smile covering the truth like a
latex mask.

Whenever people idealize their caretakers, chances are pretty good that
the opposite is true. Sometimes this illusion is created by the parents,
who insist in godlike fashion that they’re perfect and that the child
owes them obedience because they’re responsible for his or her
existence. Other times the illusion is created by the child as a
survival strategy, disconnecting from reality in order to avoid the pain
of growing up in a toxic environment.

So I make an ill-advised attempt to break through Belle’s walls. I
explain this theory to her, concluding: “No parent is capable of being
perfect. They’re only capable of telling their children they are.”

“And you can get good things from bad parents,” Veronika adds, allowing
herself to engage with Belle. She wants to help. We’re growing closer
already. “My father was never around when I was growing up and my mother
always worked. So I was taking the bus alone around the city when I was
only eight. That’s why I’m so independent now.”

I wonder if I give off an enmeshment pheromone that attracts abandoned
women. Or if it’s just that the majority of fathers are so shitty that
most women have been abandoned by them in some way.

As we continue with our stories, Belle slams her drink onto the table
and shouts so loudly that heads turn. “All right, my mom is a
narcissistic, self-righteous bitch!” Then her face scrunches and tears
pour out. “Don’t go there anymore, okay? Just don’t go there! You kept
pushing—and now you’re there.”

And just like that, our moment of intimate connection has popped.

Or has it?

At least Belle broke through to reality. Now we know who she is. Just as
some people have a drug or sex addiction, she has a word addiction. She
builds a wall of words to protect herself from uncomfortable feelings.
However, when someone is enmeshed with a parent of the same sex, this
can make it difficult for them to form intimate friendships of the same
gender. So that may be a big barrier for us as a quad.

On a more encouraging note, now that we’ve shared our vulnerabilities,
Veronika’s actually started looking into Belle’s eyes again when she
speaks. Lesson of the day: The quickest route to poly-harmony—and life
among the rest of the walking wounded—is truth and understanding.

As we leave, Veronika puts her arms around me and kisses the back of my
neck. Then she moves my arm around Belle and we all walk out together. I
kiss each of them on the lips. And for the first time that day, I have
hope. We feel like a V.

When we return home, Veronika says she wants to take a shower. I step
into one of the bathrooms to clean up and prepare myself for the
culmination of our first night together.

But as I’m standing there, Belle walks in behind me, flicks my ear
provocatively with her tongue, and whispers, “I want to fuck you. But I
want you to turn around first and put your cock deep down my throat.”

“I’d like to do that so badly,” I tell her. “But we need to wait until
Veronika’s out of the shower.”

I lead her into Veronika’s room, and we lie on the bed and talk while
waiting. But after a couple of minutes, Belle starts to fidget. Then she
suddenly jumps up and runs through the house, laughing and giggling.

And my hope, once again, plummets. Belle seems to have gone haywire. I’m
not sure if it’s the alcohol, the jet lag, the nervousness, the mother
wound we poked, petulance about having to wait for Veronika, or some
kind of misguided flirtation meant to get me chasing her.

Veronika emerges from the bathroom and lies in bed next to me. The sound
of Belle crashing into walls, laughing hysterically, then panting like
she has asthma, fills the house.

“What’s that girl doing now?” Veronika asks, her voice dripping with
condescension.

“I honestly have no idea.” When I met Belle, she was shy, cerebral, and
good-humored. This is a side of her I’ve never seen. In fact, I’ve been
around more drunk women than I’d care to admit and this is something
I’ve never experienced or even imagined before. All I’m able to
empathize with right now are the walls.

Life has a sick sense of humor: One of the reasons I felt so trapped
with Ingrid was that I resented her for holding me back from sleeping
with Belle. But now all I want is a break from her—and it hasn’t even
been twelve hours. Perhaps the secret to fidelity is knowing that the
grass is crazier on the other side.

Belle runs back into the room, jumps into bed, and tries to kiss
Veronika. But Veronika turns her head away wordlessly. Belle freezes for
a moment, then stands up and stumbles back out of the room. We hear her
running manically through the house again, opening and closing closet
doors, until finally she runs into her bathroom, shuts the door, and
locks it.

“Maybe she’s on a medication that reacts badly with alcohol,” I
apologize to Veronika.

“Maybe she is,” she responds dispassionately, then rolls over and grabs
her journal and a pen from the bedside table. I wonder what she’s
writing. I should probably ask everyone to keep a journal of her
experience here so we can untangle it later.

I lie silently next to her, hoping that tonight is an aberration, that
Belle just got too nervous and drank too much, that through some miracle
Veronika will forgive and forget. This isn’t supposed to be our
honeymoon night, I remind myself, but simply the first date.

When I wake in the morning, Belle is back in bed and the three of us are
spooning.

That’s when I discover yet another challenge of polyamory: It’s
difficult to get up and go to the bathroom without disturbing anyone
when you’re sandwiched between two sleeping women.

But at least there’s still hope for this group relationship. After all,
things can’t get any weirder than they did last night.

Excerpts from Veronika’s Journal

I just arrived to the airport and I’m waiting to go through customs. I’m
so happy he asked me to come here. Last time we saw each other, I loved
him, at least for a few hours until my mind took over. I guess he has
many girls like me. Just like I have my other potentials. For me it’s
not a problem. Let it be.

Since the day I was born, my life has been adventurous. I’m not sure how
it was possible that so many things happened to me all the time. I guess
I was silly and careless and extreme, and also there wasn’t anyone to
look after me. My father was most of the time drunk or at work or both,
and my mom was always busy looking after the garden and the animals and
she had some kind of job somewhere also.

. . .

What I’ve learned about relationships is that the most important thing
is talking. If two or more people have a relationship, they must be able
to talk with each other with no hesitation about their feelings. As an
example, I was upset about his texting and didn’t say anything. But he
understood me and started to talk with me himself. I told him what I was
feeling and ever since that moment, everything’s been different. We
changed our behavior and found a compromise. It was very surprising
because it wasn’t hard at all. I’m so glad that he did it.

. . .

Stretched-out cardigan, white shirt, plaid skirt, black high platform
shoes, glasses, Pippi Longstocking pigtails, Aussie. Total schoolgirl
outfit. Very porn. Cheap. But still interesting. And I guess men
definitely love it. But he chose a girl like that to be part of this.
Terrible!

I think I must have been okay with this idea only because I wanted to
spend more time with him. I think I wasn’t quite able to imagine how
things were going to be here. I was silly, but I’m learning from it. And
that’s good.

. . .

I’m already sick of that girl. She talks so much! It feels like she’s
not going to stop ever.

And I don’t look at him with the “I’m in love” look anymore. I feel like
he’s not able to feel sincere feelings. I feel like everything is mind
games so he could make his idea come true. If he really cared about me,
he wouldn’t do this to me. Is he planning to fuck us all just one after
another? What is he thinking? He feels that he can do everything. And at
the same time, we gave him permission for it.

The difference between men and women is that we do things that we
sometimes don’t want to for something better. We gave him permission
because of love. We hoped one day he would be ours. But maybe we
actually just gave him away.

. . .

Now the Australian girl has become so desperate that she acts like a
crazy person. She laughs all the time very loudly, but I guess deep
inside she’s crying. There’s no logic in her behavior. She’s really
drunk and looking for him in closets. Seems like this situation makes us
all act a little funny.

Tomorrow the third girl is coming. She’s French. I hope she’s going to
be more normal, not like this one here.

29

In the morning, Veronika makes eggs-in-the-hole for the three of us and
we sit around the breakfast table talking. Now that Belle is sober,
there’s actually a semblance of comfortable domesticity.

I’m not sure if Veronika will ever respect Belle after last night, but
at least she’s tolerating her. Hopefully Anne, with her quiet, centered
energy, will be the connective tissue we’re missing.

When we drive to the airport, Veronika gets the front seat since she
made breakfast. I know, it’s absurd.

As we arrive, I spot Anne standing expectantly outside the terminal, the
missing toe of our tridactyl foot, looking so fragile that she’d blow
over if a truck drove by too quickly. Her eyes, glowing like headlights,
seem to take up a quarter of her face, the rest of which is obscured by
strands of unkempt blond hair. When I jump out to greet her, she
embraces me for a quiet, connecting minute. Then she climbs into the
backseat and I take them on a mini-tour of the city.

“She’s incredible,” Veronika tells me when we return home. “I think
there’s a lot I can learn from her.”

I breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe this is the dose of fresh air and
peaceful energy we needed for balance. Perhaps this quad will actually
work now.

That night, we join James and Nicole at Supperclub, followed by an
after-party at Nicole’s loft with six other swinger and BDSM couples,
including the inescapable Chelsea and Tommy.

Her loft is the swinger version of a bachelor pad. There are scaffolding
towers hung with lights and speakers, all remote-controlled from her
computer; a stripper pole in the center of the room; even an
inexplicable round table like the one in Corey Feldman’s hotel suite.

Veronika and Anne sit on the couch and discuss the healing center in
France where Anne does acupuncture for a living. I put an arm around
them and join the conversation. Belle, who’s snuck a couple of drinks
in, sits on my other side and takes my free hand. For a moment, we are a
functional relationship.

Then Belle sidles closer to me and tries to make out. It seems not like
an act of spontaneous passion, but an attempt to prove to the others
that she’s the number-one girlfriend.

When I pull back, Belle storms away, then dances erotically on the
stripper pole and makes out with Nicole. “She’s just doing that to get
your approval,” Veronika remarks drily. “Can we go home soon?”

And now we are a dysfunctional relationship.

“Let me check with everyone else,” I tell her. I’m starting to wonder if
the more people there are in a relationship, the less freedom each
person actually has.

I talk to Belle and, of course, she wants to stay.

I return to the couch and discuss it with Veronika as the swingers next
to us stare at the circular table as if it’s the monolith from _2001_.
Suddenly, Anne rolls her head softly toward me, her eyes gentle and
pleading, and asks, “Can I talk to you in private?”

I tell Veronika we’ll be right back and walk with Anne to the entryway
of the apartment. She’s silent at first, as if too scared to speak,
until finally the words come tumbling out. “I don’t understand why
you’re always going like this with everybody,” Anne says, agitated. To
demonstrate, she grabs my left arm with surprising roughness and rubs
her hands along it spastically. “In France, when people do that, it
isn’t just a friendly thing. It means something. So I don’t understand
it.” She pauses and shakes her head as I try to grasp what she’s saying.
“At home, we just don’t do this.”

I stand there for a moment, mystified. When her point becomes clear, my
last flicker of hope dies: She’s already jealous. She thinks I’m hitting
on Veronika and Belle.

“Everyone I’m touching, I’ve already slept with,” I tell her. “Just like
I have a relationship with you, I have a relationship with them. I
explained that to you that before we came, remember?”

She nods yes, but she still seems displeased. It clearly wasn’t the
answer she was hoping for. And I’m in shock. I met Veronika at a switch
club where she was fucking everyone in sight; Anne presumably knew where
I went and what I was doing that night; and when I first slept with
Belle, we had another woman in bed with us. I met each of them under
nonmonogamous circumstances and clearly told them we’d be living with
two other women in a group relationship.

And now every one of them, with the possible exception of Veronika,
seems to want me to herself. Maybe what Randy’s wife said at the dinner
where I met Nicole _is_ actually true for most people: Sexual
experimentation is fun—until you’re with someone you have feelings for.

It’s these damn feelings. They’re to blame. Why is it that as soon as
they descend on someone, they bring ownership with them in the passenger
seat? A piece of relationship advice Lorraine taught in rehab rings
ominously in my head: “Unspoken expectations are premeditated
resentments.”

When we return to the party, Belle rushes to my side. “Nicole’s so hot,”
she says. “I’ve been making out with her all night.”

She hooks her arm in mine, and I worry that Anne will see it and get
upset. “I don’t know if we can do this in front of Anne,” I tell her.
“She needs some time to get comfortable with all the touching.”

Belle wheels around and stomps off again, grabbing James’s arm to spite
me. I’m locked in a game of emotional chess that’s far out of the depth
of someone who’s experienced nothing but monogamy all his life. If I
touch anyone, someone will get upset. But if I don’t touch anyone,
someone else will get upset.

I feel not like a lover anymore, but a referee.

It looks like the party’s about to get started here, but it’s not one we
can be part of. I gather my partners and leave, trying to figure out how
to create the sense of family that Orpheus Black talked about. When Anne
clambers into the front seat without checking with the other women, who
exchange peevish glances, I console myself with the thought that maybe
we’re actually acting like a typical family.

Back at the house, I visit Veronika in her room and bid her good night.
“Come back,” she implores. I tell her I’ll try.

Then I visit Belle. “This isn’t working for me,” she complains. “I want
to be able to touch you when I want.”

“We need to stick together as a team to make this work,” I remind her.

“I’m a girl and I have emotions,” she responds. “And though my head says
we’re a team, I still want to be with only you.”

And then I visit Anne. But when she asks me to stay for a little while,
I look at her lying there, starved for connection and reassurance after
her long trip, and give in. It’s only fair: I’ve already slept once with
each of the others. As I remove her clothes, I’m excited to feel once
more the runner’s legs, swimmer’s abs, and ballerina’s breasts she keeps
hidden beneath her formless clothes.

Still, I can’t spend the night because that will hurt the other girls.

When I break the news a while later, Anne inquires, simply, “Have you
ever felt true love before?”

It’s an odd non sequitur, so I tell her, “I’ve been in love.”

“But true love?”

“What’s the difference?”

“True love is when you’re a mother and your daughter is born. It’s that
much love and you feel it all the time.”

“So it’s feeling that way every second of every day forever?”

“Yes. You’re so in love that you don’t want to be with other people.”

“I don’t know,” I reply. “Have you ever felt true love before?”

“Not before I met you.”

My blood freezes. I thought this was just sweet pillow talk. I can’t
believe she’s gotten that attached so quickly. I’ve invited an addict
here: a love junkie, connecting in a fog of fantasy. “When you’re a
mother and your second child is born, you still feel just as much love
as when your first child was born,” I tell her. I speak as slowly as
possible, so she’ll understand. “It’s not a sign of true love when you
only want to feel it with one person who you just met and don’t really
know yet. That’s more like obsession.”

She’s silent.

“Do you understand?”

“Yes,” she says, kissing me tenderly. “I understand.”

And I hope she does.

I walk upstairs and search the closets for extra blankets, but all I can
find is a single spare sheet. I grab it and check the living room couch
to see if it unfolds into a bed. Unfortunately it doesn’t.

So I toss the back cushions onto the floor to make a little more room,
lie on the narrow couch, and spread the sheet over myself.

It’s cold, cramped, and uncomfortable. The only thing keeping me warm is
my frustration. I’m living with three women I’m dating, and I’m spending
the night alone on the couch. This is most definitely the last thing I
thought I’d be doing in my Father Yod dream house.

30

As soon as I wake up, I place an emergency call to Pepper, explain the
situation I’m in, and beg for advice.

“You’re trying to run before you can walk,” he responds.

“What do you mean?”

“How many people are in the house?”

“Four of us.”

“So mathematically that’s six relationships. And it’s hard enough to
make one relationship work.”

I had thought of it as a single relationship, or three at most. But I do
the math—the Gauss formula of polyamory*—and he’s right.

“But there was this guy Father Yod,” I protest, “who had fourteen wives
and it worked for him . . . I think.” I realize I don’t know much about
how Father Yod managed his relationships. In fact, I never actually read
the book Rick showed me. I just looked at the pictures.

“Who’s Father Yod?”

“He’s like Charles Manson, but without the killing.” Actually, that’s
not totally true. I recall reading online afterward that Father Yod was
a judo expert who murdered two people with his bare hands in
self-defense.

“What I can tell you is that a shared living situation is what we call
an advanced skill,” Pepper explains. “But trust me, it can work. I just
went on a weeklong vacation to Hawaii with my partner and her boyfriend.
And it was totally smooth because the three of us had spent so much time
together.”

“Right now, I can’t see us ever getting to that point.” I suppose after
a few years, one can get used to anything.

“Do you want me to come by and talk to them?”

“Please!”

When Pepper arrives an hour later, we gather in the living room,
desperate for a miracle. I dare not sit on the couch in case it looks
like I’m favoring whichever woman drops down next to me, so I take an
armchair instead. Veronika and Pepper sit in the other chairs while
Belle and Anne share the couch.

I introduce Pepper to the women and tell him about the previous night.
He listens carefully, then responds as if telling preschoolers to play
nicely with one another. Unlike with monogamy, our culture offers no
schooling on how to make a group relationship work, no real role models
to look up to, and few—if any—friends to turn to for advice. Even in
movies, when couples decide to open their marriage, the results are
usually disastrous and the moral of the story is to stick with what
you’ve got.

“Here’s your first lesson in going out together,” he begins. His voice
is so slow and measured that it’s hard to imagine anything short of a
machete-wielding maniac ruffling him. I wonder if he was always this
calm and deliberate or if it’s something he learned from years of
managing multiple relationships. “You need to talk before you leave and
have a plan for party protocol. If someone gets tired, do they take a
cab home alone or do you all leave together? And if it’s a sexual
situation, decide ahead of time whether you want to watch or leave or
join the sex pile.” This makes perfect sense, yet it never occurred to
me: The art of group relationships is logistics. “I want to encourage
you to do little check-ins with one another constantly, with the
knowledge that you don’t know each other very well. This way you can
start to build a team feeling together.”

We nod in agreement. I suppose I was naïve to assume we would all just
instantly become attached and live in relational utopia together. I’ve
made mistakes in every monogamous relationship I’ve had, but I learned
from them and that made the next relationship better. So it makes sense
that my first multiple-partner relationship isn’t going to be a runaway
success. It takes experience and failure to get good at anything. This
is my opportunity to learn.

“I want to add something that’s important,” Pepper continues. “You”—he
points to me—“are the _fulcrum_. This is a long-known poly situation.
The fulcrum is the only person in a relationship with each partner, but
because of that, you end up torn in a lot of different directions. It’s
a very uncomfortable thing, because you’re empowered and disempowered at
the same time.” He turns to the women. “So I would like to recommend
that you all try to de-center Neil a little.”

I heave a hopefully imperceptible sigh of relief. I watched several
documentaries on poly pods before coming here, and many were led by
people with a pathological need to be the focal point of everyone’s
love. They didn’t seem to care whose feelings got hurt as long as the
empty space in their own heart was kept filled. But for me, it’s no fun
being the center of attention when it results in collateral damage to
other people’s feelings.

“So how do we de-center me?” I ask Pepper.

“The three of you”—he gestures to the women—“should hang out without him
and also start negotiating decisions that don’t have to go through him
first. The easy part of the situation is you and Neil, and you and Neil,
and you and Neil”—here he points to each woman. “The hard part of the
situation is your relationships with each other. I have a saying: Poly
works or fails on trust between _metamours_.”

“What’s a metamour?” Veronika asks.

“A metamour is a partner’s partner. So if Neil and I were both dating
you, then Neil would be my metamour. And it succeeds between him and me,
because we have the hard part but not the good stuff. So when you build
trust among metamours, everything comes together and the group starts
functioning. Does that make sense?”

We were in the dark before. This pale Goth guy is the light. He’s a
relationship pioneer, mapping new realms in interpersonal space.

“So what do I do if I want to spend time with Neil alone?” Belle asks.
“Every time I try to do that, he says it’s rude to someone else.”

“Try not making the request to Neil. Make it to Anne and Veronika. And
if they both say it’s okay, then you can do whatever you want with
Neil.” The corners of Belle’s mouth turn up in an unsuccessfully
repressed smile. Pepper spots this and adds sagely, “But be willing to
hear a no.”

Veronika sighs and uncrosses her legs. “It’s so hard to share a person,”
she says. “It would be easier if we didn’t have strong feelings. But
there’s always going to be this mental fight to have him.”

Although having three attractive women fighting over me may seem like an
ego trip, in reality it’s nerve shattering. Whatever interest they had
in me before they arrived seems to have been exacerbated by the
competition. According to a copy of _O_ magazine I once read in Sheila’s
waiting room, polygamous men live nine years longer, on average, than
monogamous men. But I wonder how Oprah could possibly be right. Because
this is definitely not good for my blood pressure.

Pepper turns to me: “What you can do to get them past that point is
reassure them. I’ve seen really jealous people and people with a lot of
abandonment issues get past their shit once the fear of loss goes away.
A good nonmonogamous group is like a flock of geese, which is to say it
separates and comes back together.”

Anne opens her mouth to speak. The words escape soft and unsure.
Everyone leans in to make sure they catch them. “For me, I was really
surprised last night because when everybody was touching, it was hurting
me.” She takes a pause so long it seems like an intermission. “I have a
complicated family history, so maybe I get more possessive. But I
understand now that we have to make things work so this can be a
relationship.”

Pepper’s talk seems to be straightening everyone out. The metamours are
remembering that they didn’t come here to be in some _Bachelor-_like
competition, but to live, learn, and grow in a mature relationship
together. “I would recommend letting go of expectations and trying to
get to a place of acceptance with everything,” Pepper tells her. “If
things get weird, let them be weird. If you can all get to a high
communication level, and learn the process of negotiation and setting
boundaries and talking through discomfort, this will start working much
better for all of you.”

Before Pepper leaves, the four of us agree to hold house meetings every
day, during which each person will get a turn to speak
uninterrupted—like in the talking-stick circle I made fun of in rehab.

As a sense of calm and understanding descends on the house afterward,
Veronika makes egg salad sandwiches and we sit around the table, all on
the same page for the first time. Then, with Anne taking the front seat
of the car without incident, we visit Alcatraz. As we walk from the
ferry to the island prison, Belle holds my left arm while Anne clutches
the other. Veronika wanders behind, taking photos.

“I feel like I’m a third child whose mother doesn’t have enough hands to
hold,” Veronika says as she catches up to us.

She takes Anne’s hand in hers as a group of frat boys walks by and gives
me a thumbs-up. For the first time, there’s a group energy connecting
us. Perhaps all of us just needed to let go of our expectations like
Pepper recommended, adjust to being somewhere new, and allow the
relationship to set its own course.

And that’s when something unexpected happens: I’m overcome by a powerful
sense of unworthiness. It doesn’t seem fair that these women have to
share me. Any one of them could easily have her pick of the guys here
who keep looking at us. But instead they’re settling for scraps of my
affection—the crumbs of a crumb.

When I imagined living in a freewheeling love commune while I was dating
Ingrid, I thought I’d be adrift in a blissful sea of pleasure,
excitement, and feminine energy. But instead I feel embarrassed that I’m
monopolizing three hearts.

I spent my childhood starved for my mother’s and babysitter’s love,
feeling like most of their positivity went to my brother and their
negativity to me. So being in a position where I’m actually getting so
much positive female caring is a new experience. Maybe the real purpose
of this quad relationship for me is to break through my walls and feel
worthy of love—or whatever this is.

31

In the car on the way home, I tell the girls that Nicole and James
invited us to a play party called Kinky Salon. Where a swinger party is
generally for couples looking to swap, a play party is basically any
hosted alt-sex event where people get together to throw down. And Kinky
Salon is one of the most playful parties of them all: a cool, creative
scene with beautiful women, costumed hipsters, and no creep factor.

“Is everyone comfortable going?” I ask.

“I’m going to stay home,” Anne says.

It’s the same thing she said in France. And, secretly, I’m grateful.
Since Pepper’s talk, she seems to have left her love-addiction haze and
accepted our quad-ness. And now, finally, we are a flock of geese.

Even Veronika and Belle appear to be getting along. As soon as we get
home, Belle asks her, “Can I dress you? You’re so pretty and I have some
clothes you’ll love.”

The compliment appears to be a sincere attempt to connect. And since
women trying on one another’s clothing is a universal sign of
sisterhood, I leave them alone to bond. Maybe they just needed time—and
Pepper’s reassurance—to get comfortable with each other rather than
feeling forced to be friends.

When they reemerge, Veronika is wearing a fitted pink-and-white-striped
dress with a plunging neckline and a black leather corset. She looks
stunning, so Belle gets the front seat as a reward for her generosity.
It’s still ridiculous, I know.

Appropriately, Kinky Salon is throwing a harem-themed party. When we
arrive at the warehouse apartment with James and Nicole, we see men
wearing turbans and smoking hookahs while women in veils and gold lamé
bras sit in their laps, fucking them as Arabic music pipes softly
through the rooms. At every party I’ve been to so far, the women seem to
be in control of when the action starts and with whom, but once things
are underway, they tend to play submissive roles. I don’t see any
sultanesses, for example, worshipped by harem boys.

The back room is like a low-rent version of the French switch club. It’s
full of mattresses pushed together, but instead of a free-for-all,
people are clustered in twosomes and threesomes.

As we sit and watch, Belle whispers to me, “Why don’t you and Veronika
have sex?”

“Do you want to join us if she’s open to it?”

“I don’t think she likes me that much. Go ahead. I’ll get you later.”

“Are you sure?” I can’t believe this is happening. It’s practically a
miracle. In fact, I’ll go out on a limb and say it _is_ a miracle. The
poly gods have smiled on us today.

“I’m sure.”

Between Pepper’s pep talk and the lack of alcohol in her bloodstream,
Belle’s another person tonight. I leave her with Nicole and James, then
lead Veronika to the only unoccupied spot on the mattress pile, which is
just a few feet away from a woman impaled on the lap of a man in a
purple turban. Soon Veronika’s on top of me, riding herself to orgasm
after orgasm, her lips parted ecstatically, her back arched
electrically, her hips pursuing perfect rhythm and pressure, and both of
us once again enjoying the rapture we last experienced together in
Paris.

When we rejoin the group, Belle rushes to my side and asks, “Can I spend
the night with you tonight?”

“So that was your plan?” It seems reasonable, but then I think, What
about Anne?

I check my phone and there’s a text from her: “Need and would love to
spend the night with you.”

Now what?

I can’t spend the night with Anne, because Belle will be upset. And I
can’t spend it with Belle, because Anne will be hurt. And I can’t spend
it with Veronika, because then both Belle and Anne will be angry. It is
the polyamorist’s paradox.

And anyway, didn’t Pepper tell them they were supposed to negotiate this
with one another, not with me?

I explain the situation privately to James and ask what he recommends
doing. He shakes his head and grimaces. “There’s no right answer. I
tried dating another girl with Nicole and a similar thing happened. You
want these multiple relationships, but you just end up hurting
everybody. It’s a lot of work. The amount of communication it takes is
exhausting, and someone always feels left out.”

I’m relieved to hear it’s not just me who has these problems, that this
would likely have happened with any women I chose to live with, unless
they were very poly-experienced.

“I guess swinging works because all the women you’re sleeping with are
in other relationships, so they’re not a threat to your partner.”

“Exactly,” he says, smiling. “It’s polyamory light.”

As we gather our partners and leave, James sizes me up for a moment, as
if deciding whether I deserve whatever favor he’s about to bestow. Then
he puts his arm around me and whispers, “I want you to meet a friend of
ours named Reid Mihalko. He’s the Yoda of sex parties. If anyone can
help these women loosen up and get on the same page, it’s him.”

Back at the apartment, I make the rounds. I tuck everybody in, discuss
how they’re feeling, and help them understand why I can’t spend the
night with them. Then I settle in for another uncomfortable night on the
couch.

It was a good day. The best yet. But I’m still sleeping on the sofa.
However, unlike the night before, this time I’m sleeping with hope. We
made huge strides forward today. And if Reid Mihalko is even half as
experienced and helpful as Pepper, this whole crazy idea just might
actually work.

32

The next morning, the metamours follow more of Pepper’s advice and have
an adventure without me. Nicole picks them up and takes them shopping,
then treats them to a fancy brunch. And just as Pepper predicted, they
return brimming with positive energy and a surprising sense of
camaraderie. I’m starting to become de-centered.

They also return with an extra body. He’s a broad-shouldered,
large-skulled gentle giant with sandy blond hair, wire-frame glasses,
and large teeth. He’s wearing jeans and a slightly undersized purple
T-shirt stretched across his paunchy belly with the words SEX GEEK
emblazoned on it.

“Meet Reid Mihalko,” Nicole announces.

Reid, she explains, is one of the leading figures in San Francisco’s
sex-positive scene. He has slept with, by his own estimation, a thousand
men and women. And he teaches courses on everything from kissing to
pegging (when a woman puts on a strap-on and inserts it in a man).

“I’ve come here on a mission,” he says. “James told me everything.”

He speaks slowly and rakishly, with one corner of his mouth rising
higher than the other. He’s a cross between Clark Kent, John Malkovich,
and someone recovering from a mild stroke. He says he wants to observe
us checking in and then he has something important to discuss.

We take our seats in the living room. As usual, I choose a chair just to
be safe.

For the first time, every check-in is positive. Belle says she had an
epiphany last night at Kinky Salon that relationships are about giving,
not getting. Anne explains that her mind and heart are starting to open
to this experience. And even Veronika has warmed up.

“The vibe isn’t so tense anymore,” she says. “I feel like we’re actually
connected and can learn from each other now, so I’m very happy about
that. I really liked last night and I would like to do it sometime more,
yes?” She laughs.

When we’re finished, Reid asks us to take a deep breath and exhale
loudly. It reminds me of something Sheila would do. Then, in a very
slow, didactic voice, he tells us, “Aside from doing cuddle parties,
which are nonsexual workshops around touch and affection, I have been
throwing play parties and creating spaces for adults to be able to
frolic and explore their sexuality since 1999. And this evening I’m
throwing a party for a friend who’s staying with me and who hasn’t had
sex in a year. My objective is to get her laid. And we’re having about
thirty people come over to hang out and play, whatever that looks like
for them.

“So I’m here to determine, one, if it’s good for you all as a group.
And, two, if it’s a good idea for my community. I want to create a space
that feels very safe and genuine because I specialize in those kinds of
dynamics.”

Once again, I’m in debt to James and Nicole: Where Pepper helped us
negotiate the emotional boundaries, it seems that Reid is here to help
us negotiate the physical ones.

Reid then asks each of us a series of questions designed to open us up
to positive experiences that we’ve been denying ourselves:

“What are you afraid to ask other people for?”

“What don’t you think you deserve?”

“If you could experience anything in your next few days together, what
would it be?”

They are the right questions, and they allow each metamour to be heard
and feel understood rather than judged. Soon Belle is talking about
wanting to have sex with two men, and Veronika is saying she wants to be
fucked by a girl with a strap-on. Even Anne, in her own way, says she
wants to join in: “I want to feel free together without being hurt.”

I suppose this is yet another female dilemma: to feel free to follow the
cravings of one’s heart and body without being hurt or shamed afterward.
I’ve never met a man who didn’t want to experience his sexual fantasies
in real life, yet I’ve met many women who’ve said that they wouldn’t be
comfortable actually experiencing the scenarios they masturbate to.

“And what about you?” Reid asks me. “What are your intentions for the
next few days?”

“All I want is for the three of us to laugh a lot, enjoy our days
together, and then sleep in the same bed comfortably.”

“Can you be more precise? Is there anything you’d like specifically to
happen in that bed?”

“You know, it doesn’t even matter. That’s my hope for us. Probably more
so now that I’m sleeping on the couch every night.”

“Thank you.” He looks each of us in the eyes appreciatively. It’s
difficult to tell whether he’s genuinely connecting or performing a
rehearsed gesture. But either way, it works. “My invitation for each of
you is to spend more time asking for what _you_ want rather than asking
everyone else what _they_ want,” he concludes. “You will speed up your
growth by being selfish. So imagine that the people you’re looking at
can actually take care of themselves. And if you ask for what you want
and trust that the other person will say yes or no powerfully, it will
make things very interesting.”

Life is a learned skill, but instead of teaching it, our culture
force-fills developing minds with long division and capital
cities—until, at the end of the mandatory period of bondage that’s
hyperbolically called school, we’re sent into the world knowing little
about it. And so, left on our own to figure out the most important parts
of life, we make mistakes for years until, by the time we’ve learned
enough from our stumbling to be effective human beings, it’s time for us
to die.

In other words, if I hadn’t met teachers like Pepper and Reid, who’ve at
least excelled in one area of this short pilgrimage toward the grave, I
would have given up on this quad and the possibility of one ever
working. But I now see my responsibility for the problems we’ve been
having. As usual, I’ve been trying to please everyone and sacrificing my
own needs. And that’s not what I broke up with Ingrid to do. In fact, in
trying to take care of everybody, I ended up taking care of nobody.

I glance at Nicole and she nods back at me as if she’s reading my mind.
Reid takes a long breath and exhales enthusiastically. It’s not a sigh
so much as it is a display. “If I were to invite you all to come to the
play party, raise your hand if you would like to go.”

Everyone’s hands go up. Even, ever so meekly, Anne’s.

33

When we leave for Reid’s house in Oakland several hours later, Anne
clambers into the queen position in the car as if it’s hers by right. I
make a mental note to talk to her about it at the next house meeting. We
then pick up Nicole, who went back to her apartment to shower and
change.

“Is James coming?” I ask when she scoots into the backseat, wearing a
black silk blouse and a tight gray skirt.

“No, he has to work,” she says.

My quad has turned into a pentagram.

“Let’s discuss party protocol,” I suggest, taking Pepper’s advice. The
car is crawling through typical San Francisco traffic, so we have plenty
of time to negotiate.

Nicole speaks first: “I can only watch, because James and I have a rule
that we only play together.” It seems their relationship has gotten more
restrictive since she broke the rules in the laundry room. Trust is a
chain that gets longer the less you pull on it.

“For me,” Veronika says, “everyone can do whatever they want. I don’t
mind.”

“Same here,” Belle adds. “As long as Neil doesn’t have sex with anyone
in front of me.”

When I met Belle, I had sex with another woman in front of her and she
didn’t mind. But that was when she thought she’d never see me again.
According to evolutionary theory, it’s supposed to be men who are wired
to get more upset when a woman has sex with someone else because his
genes won’t be passed on if he raises children who aren’t his; women
have supposedly evolved to get more upset when a man has an emotional
affair because of the fear of losing his support and protection. Of
course, we have DNA testing and economic independence now, so evolution
needs to catch up.

“You can all do whatever you want also,” I tell them.

The only person who hasn’t checked in is Anne, who’s wearing polyester
slacks, flat black shoes, a stiff button-down shirt, and a giant
navy-blue shawl. She looks aggressively unsexy.

“What are your boundaries tonight?” I repeat the question for her.

She stares out the window for a minute as if she doesn’t hear, then,
without turning, responds, “I’m not comfortable.”

“Not comfortable with what?”

She speaks so softly that the metamours in the backseat lean forward to
hear. “With you having sex.”

It takes a few seconds for the words to register. Then they hit me like
a blackjack. “With Belle and Veronika? Or with the other people there?”
Everything seemed to be going so well today.

“With anyone.”

For chrissake. At the house meeting this afternoon, we told you where we
were going and what we would be doing there. You raised your hand and
said you wanted to go. And now you’re changing the rules?

That’s what I want to say.

Instead, I try not to react. Where there is reactivity, there is a
wound. It seems they were right about everything in sex addiction
therapy, except the sex part.

I scroll through my brain, searching for the right response. I try to
follow Reid’s advice—to speed up my growth by being selfish and see Anne
as an adult who can take care of herself. My goal here is to be honest.
To allow discomfort. To communicate openly. She needs to be prepared to
accept a no.

“I can’t promise you what will or won’t happen tonight,” I tell her. “I
might just lie there and watch people and do nothing, or I might have
sex with everyone. I have no idea.”

Anne doesn’t respond.

“Do you still want to go if that happens?”

Silence. Maybe she’s scrolling through her brain for the right response.
Or maybe she’s shutting down.

She mumbles something.

“What?”

Mumble.

“Can you say that louder?” I’m fighting to stay in the functional adult.

Finally: “If it happens, then I want to go home.”

“Back to the house?”

“Back to France.”

I thought the French were open-minded, liberal, and tolerated affairs. I
thought Anne knew what was happening when I went to those clubs. I
clearly need to stop assuming that _anything_ is true.

“Would you be more comfortable if I limited myself to just kissing or
cuddling at the party?”

“No,” she says.

The mood in the car dims as each of our fantasies for the night smash
like a flock of geese against a picture window. This is beyond even my
worst-case scenario for our free-love group relationship: Now I can’t
even hold someone’s hand at a fucking orgy?

Irritation creeps into my voice. “Before you came here, I told you we’d
be living with two other girlfriends and going to sex parties like the
one I went to in Paris. So you have to understand that I can’t just
pretend like I’m only going to be with you.”

And she’s mute again.

I look at Nicole beseechingly, my eyes flashing a distress signal.

“There are many people who don’t believe it’s natural for them to be
with one person for the rest of their lives,” Nicole explains patiently.
“They believe that their sexuality shouldn’t be owned or controlled by
someone else, and that if they have sex with another person it doesn’t
change the way they feel about their partner. These are the kind of
people who are going to be at this party.”

Anne doesn’t react, so Nicole continues: “Think about it this way. When
people have friends, they have different kinds of relationships with
each of them. Even if they have a best friend, that doesn’t mean they
can’t have other friends. And that’s the way the people at this party
think of sexual relationships.”

After a long, uncomfortable silence, during which she appears to come to
some sort of decision, Anne turns to face me. “In Paris, we connected on
this level.” She points to her head, her heart, and her crotch. “But
this time my feelings for you are different. My body and mind are
changing.”

I don’t exactly understand her point, but it sounds like she’s breaking
up with me in her own way, which is a relief. “I feel the same way,” I
tell her. “You’re a beautiful person inside and outside. But we’re very
different and want different things. So maybe it’s best if we’re just
friends.”

When I say this, her face falls. Evidently I misunderstood. “What’s
wrong?” I ask.

“I said my feelings for you have changed.”

“I know.”

“They’ve gotten stronger.”

And now my face falls.

34

“I gave up having sex at the party last night and today it’s my turn,”
Belle vents as we approach Reid’s loft. “I’m tired of everyone”—she
searches for the word—“vag-blocking.”

This is my chance to stop taking care of everyone else’s needs and focus
on my own. Anne and I never agreed to be exclusive. The deal was that
we’d be in a group relationship. So she’s the one breaking the rules.
For the first time, I’m going to do exactly what I told the guys in
rehab that we should do: train a partner to accept a relationship on our
terms rather than us accepting it on theirs. And, most importantly, to
do it honestly.

“Here’s what I suggest,” I tell Anne. “There’s going to be a welcome
circle where everyone talks about their expectations for the party. And
I suggest leaving the room after the welcome circle. If you want to know
later whether I did anything, you can ask me and I’ll tell you the
truth.”

She nods in a direction that looks like yes. It’s clear she’s still not
completely comfortable, but those are her emotions to worry about, not
mine. I can’t get enmeshed here.

We walk into Reid’s loft. It’s a large square space with a stage in the
front, a huge carpet in the middle, a balcony that wraps around three of
the walls, and a crowd best described as pansexual: straight men, gay
men, bi men, bi women, butch lesbians, lipstick lesbians, and probably
no completely straight woman, other than maybe Anne.

We settle in a corner next to a man who introduces himself as Reid’s
building superintendent. He’s there with a woman he describes as his
“mostly lesbian girlfriend” and her female lover. Only in the Bay Area
would someone’s maintenance man also be poly and into sex parties. Now I
understand why Nicole encouraged me to rent a place here. We are in a
free territory where the sexual revolution has already been fought and
won.

As Nicole busily texts James, Reid runs the welcome circle. He lectures
first on safe sex, then on how to ask for permission to touch someone,
and finally on how to be comfortable saying no. He asks us to practice
the following dialogue with our neighbors:

ORGY PARTICIPANT 1: Can I _______ you?

ORGY PARTICIPANT 2: No.

ORGY PARTICIPANT 1: Thank you for taking care of yourself.

Supposedly no one is born with greatness. It takes, the theory goes, ten
thousand hours of experience to master something. And Reid has clearly
put in his ten thousand hours of orgies. By the time he finishes his
lecture—which serves as foreplay in the same way deity worship did at
the puja—everyone feels safe, comfortable, and ready to free their
libidos from their socially strung corsets. Everyone, that is, except
Anne—and Nicole.

“Do you know what time we’re leaving?” Nicole asks.

“I don’t know, really. We just got here.”

“Because if it’s going to be more than an hour, I’ll have James come
pick me up.”

I don’t understand why she came all the way here with us if she wanted
to go home right away. “I doubt it will be longer than an hour, but I’m
not sure. I don’t even know what’s about to happen.” I’m getting
overwhelmed. “Fuck. Why does it matter?”

“James is nervous that I’m here.”

“Then why did you come?”

“He said it was okay as long as I didn’t play with anyone.”

“So then don’t play with anyone.”

“I know, but he’s upset because he feels left out. So I just want to go
home soon, okay?”

So far, not a single alternative relationship that I’ve closely observed
appears to be free, intimate, and healthy. In the sex addiction
community, they wanted us to control our bodies so our hearts could
connect; in this community, they want us to control our hearts so our
bodies can connect. But maybe expecting to have it all—the deepest
intimacy and the most unrestrained lust—is an unrealistic quest, like
expecting a human being to be perfect. All you can do is work to get as
close as possible to the impossible.

After instructing the assemblage to take a deep breath, Reid concludes
the welcome circle by asking his guests what they want to experience
during the play party.

“I want to watch the couple next to me have sex.”

“I want to make out with every woman here for seven minutes each.”

“I want another woman to use a strap-on on me.”

“I want to go down on my boyfriend with another guy.”

Anne sits still next to me. She’s not so much holding my hand as she’s
clutching onto it for dear life.

“Do you want to leave?” I ask her when the welcome circle ends.

Silence.

A woman in front of us removes her girlfriend’s shirt and buries her
face in breasts. A guy behind us takes off his pants. He’s wearing
tightie blackies and knee-high black socks. An avalanche is rolling
toward Anne’s psyche.

“You should really leave right now,” I warn her.

Two women who are with knee-sock man begin removing their clothes. A sex
pile is forming.

I call Reid over. He’s the Yoda of orgies. He’ll know what to do. “You
always have to go with the person who has the least amount of comfort,”
he advises. “So if you have to sit here and just watch, then that’s what
you have to do.”

I’m confused by his advice. It seems like the exact opposite of what he
said at the house this afternoon about being selfish. Maybe he doesn’t
understand the situation. “But what’s not fair is that she doesn’t want
anyone else to touch me or hold my hand, yet she does those things with
me.” I sound like I’m in kindergarten. “And she knew that she was coming
here to be in a group relationship.”

“If that’s the case, then she needs to understand that you’re not
exclusive with her, and that you need to take care of yourself and she
needs to take care of herself.”

He did a total 180 again. Now I have no idea what’s right. My moral
compass has lost true north. I have to look inward for answers.

My functional adult says I should suck it up and do nothing so I don’t
hurt this wilting flower. But my inner child wants to play. He’s tired
of being held back by the emotions of the people around him.

I watch enviously as the guy with the knee-high socks enjoys his
threesome. Their bodies, hands, and tongues artfully slide across one
another in myriad shifting positions, each one natural, effortless,
creative. This picture was what I’d hoped to step into with the house
here. In his case, it’s clear the women are more into each other than
him—and maybe that’s why it’s working so well.

Meanwhile, Anne is desperately clinging to me like a stop sign for fun.
Belle is whispering sexual enticements in my ear. Nicole is asking when
we can go. And Veronika is sitting in a chair, either sulking or just
being herself.

I feel like I’m wearing a spiked suit; any move I make is going to hurt
someone.

This is the moment of poly truth: I need to man up and take charge. I
need to be Orpheus Black. I need to channel Kamala Devi. I need to get
Father Yod on them. My problem this whole time is that I’ve been trying
to rule by consensus. And every large group relationship I’ve seen or
even heard about has been run by, as Kamala put it, a benevolent
dictator. These girls are looking for a daddy, so as loathsome as that
whole dynamic is, maybe it’s time to step up and be that daddy. Not the
abandoning daddy or the enmeshing daddy, but the functional daddy with a
sense of what’s right. And what’s not right is that Anne is violating
the agreements she made and the rights of the other women in the group
to also have a relationship with me.

“Nicole, take Anne to the car,” I order.

“They can wait in my apartment if they want,” the building
superintendent offers.

“How much longer do you think you’ll be?” Nicole asks me as he zips up
his pants and leads them out.

“As long as it takes,” I tell her.

Veronika remains seated in the chair. She had her turn last night. Fair
is fair. I once spoke to Barbara Williamson, a cofounder of Sandstone
Retreat, one of the most famous swinger meccas of the seventies, and she
said that she was introduced to the Lifestyle shortly after her wedding,
when her husband fucked another woman in front of her. Although it was
painful in the moment, after she saw that it didn’t affect the
relationship in any way, she realized it wasn’t such a big deal. Maybe I
should have slept with each of the women in front of the others on the
day Anne arrived, just to get the pain and possessiveness over with for
everyone.

I take Belle’s hand and we walk through the orgy, drinking in the
spectacle. Unlike the parties I’ve been to so far, here the lights
aren’t even dimmed. There is no shame. And though the couples look more
like the ones at the polyamory conference, the scene is as beautiful as
the one at Bliss. That’s when I understand that it’s not physical beauty
that makes these parties pretty or ugly—it’s honest and open intentions.
Hypocrisy is ugly.

Upstairs, there’s a fucking machine. (Not a fucking _machine,_ but a
_fucking machine—_a dildo powered by a piston engine.) An Asian girl
lies in front of it as a large hippie woman I recognize from the
polyamory conference turns it on, then massages the girl’s breasts as
she gets robo-fucked.

Nearby, a couple is rolling around the room having sex in a large
circular ball with stirrups and handgrips. Reid’s loft is like an
amusement park for horny adults. And, as exciting as it is, it’s hard to
focus. The longer we walk around, the guiltier I feel about Anne and
Nicole. Even if they did renege on the plan, it was still inconsiderate
of me to just banish them like some sort of orgy despot. People are
allowed to change their minds.

A woman with black hair latches onto Belle and asks permission to kiss
her. They start making out, but as soon as I get turned on, Belle breaks
away and tells her, “Where’s your boyfriend? You should go find him.”

She wants me to herself even at an orgy.

Belle drags me to a spot along the balcony. Twenty feet away, Reid is
fucking a cute indie-rocker woman.

Belle and I make out as I rub her to wetness. Then she unbuttons my
pants and goes down on me. Once I’m hard, she stands up, turns away from
me, and grips the railing of the loft balcony, her ass in the air. As I
put on a condom, I start thinking about Anne again. I worry that she’s
suffering in the superintendent’s apartment, picturing me in the middle
of a sex pile. Next to her, Nicole’s probably stressed out on the phone,
getting yelled at by James for staying here without him. And I feel like
a selfish prick. I can’t believe I actually kicked them out of Reid’s
apartment just so they wouldn’t get in the way of my fun. Last night,
Veronika and I had permission. Tonight, Belle and I don’t.

I notice a nearby couple watching. Even people downstairs seem to be
looking up. It feels like their eyes are judging us, accusing us of
violating poly protocol.

The chair Veronika was sitting in is empty. I scan the room for her, but
she’s not in sight. So either she decided to participate or she also got
mad and left the loft. I feel drawn and quartered emotionally.

I shut my eyes, take a deep breath, and try to focus on the smooth,
pale, shapely body part in front of me. I thrust once and imagine it
penetrating Anne’s heart like a dagger. I thrust a second time and her
heart breaks. I thrust again and there’s nothing left of her, just an
empty shell. I thrust halfway and think that if Anne ever does chair
work, this would be on her list of traumas.

I can’t go on.

I pull out and it’s completely soft. I stagger back into a desk chair
and Belle tries to perform genital CPR. But it’s dead.

“I feel too guilty,” I tell her.

She doesn’t speak. The look on her face says enough. It’s not anger or
sadness. It’s the look of a child pouting, “It’s not fair.”

In a sudden flash of clarity, I see the truth: I made the wrong
decision. When Reid said be selfish, he wasn’t giving me permission to
hurt people’s feelings. He was giving me permission to ask for what I
wanted. And it wasn’t Anne who needed to be comfortable hearing a no, it
was Belle and me, because the person in a relationship with the least
amount of comfort _does_ get to set the boundaries—even if she keeps
changing the rules and putting on blinders to what’s really happening.
Anne heard what she wanted to hear so she could be here in San Francisco
with me. And in the same way, I heard what I wanted to hear so I could
have my free-love harem.

I’m just as bad as she is. Maybe we do belong together.

And so I sit surrounded by pleasure, descending into a giant shame
spiral.

Guilt is about what you do with your dick. Shame is about being a dick.

“Let’s just go,” I groan, defeated.

“Fine!” Belle trails behind me resentfully.

When we reach the bottom of the stairs, Nicole runs up to us in a panic.
“I’ve been trying to find you! Everyone’s really upset.”

“Everyone or Anne?”

“Everyone. And Anne is in a lot of pain.”

“That’s what I was afraid of.” Being selfish and having a conscience are
not a good combination. It’s like having a gun with bullets that, no
matter which direction they’re fired in, always end up hitting you in
the head.

“I should have just let James come get me,” Nicole vents as she rushes
us to the front door. “He’s freaking out.”

Leaving Reid’s apartment, we see Veronika in the hallway walking briskly
toward us. Her eyes lock on mine, then turn away in disgust. “I thought
I was tough,” she says bitterly. “But you really have no feelings.”

Her words send me deeper into my shame spiral. When I take care of
everyone else in the relationship, I’m miserable. When I take care of
myself, I’m still miserable. I can’t see any way to make this work.

This is the worst orgy of my life.

And maybe that’s the problem: I shouldn’t be dragging my quad around to
play parties. That’s exactly what a sex addict would do. I’m sure Father
Yod didn’t need to take his wives to sex parties. They had everything
they needed at home. Even if I’m going in all the way, the point is to
commit to a more open relationship, not to pleasing every carnal urge.
At the very least, caring, understanding, and trust need to be
established first.

Impatience is the enemy of intimacy.

Belle and I walk with Nicole and Veronika to the super’s apartment like
inmates to a courtroom. “Do I have to go inside?” Belle asks as we get
close.

“Yes, you do. Maybe you should walk in ahead of me, though, so we’re not
arriving together and rubbing it in.” A criticism Rick once gave me
flashes through my mind: You create the image that you’re a good person
as opposed to actually being a good person.

I wait outside a few more seconds, then enter. The first thing I see is
Anne sitting on the floor, wrapped deeply in her shawl. She looks like
one of those children pulled by police from under a bed after having
witnessed the brutal murder of her parents.

I apologize to her and she says nothing.

As we walk to the car, Belle darts ahead and positions herself in front
of the passenger door. “Come on,” I tell her, exasperated, showing too
little consideration too late. “Be respectful of Anne and let her sit in
the front.”

The stupid fucking front seat. The modern automobile was clearly
designed by monogamists.

Night has fallen, but it is not as dark as the mood in the car as we
drive back to San Francisco. Pepper said that the goal was to de-center
me, and I feel in this moment like I truly have lost my center. I have
no idea what to say or how to navigate this.

“Does anyone want to check in?” I ask feebly.

No one says a word. Not even Nicole.

“I’ll begin, then,” I speak to the silence. “In short, I made the wrong
decision here, and I—”

“You made the wrong decision?” Belle snaps. “Why?”

Fuck, now I’ve made it worse. Belle thinks I’m saying that I made a
mistake by choosing to be with her. “Maybe there was no right decision,”
I continue. “All week we’ve managed to survive by making sure everyone
was comfortable, even if that meant some of us not getting what we
wanted. But Reid told us in the house that we should be selfish, that
everyone will take care of themselves if you take care of yourself.” I’m
babbling now, making excuses. “And maybe I should have just gone with
what I felt, but he seemed to know what he was saying, so it just really
threw me off.”

“You should maybe think for yourself instead of doing what other people
tell you,” Veronika pipes in icily.

She’s absolutely right. Mean but right. I’m losing it: It’s hard enough
hurting one person in a monogamous relationship, but today I’ve hurt
four people. Polyamory is not just about having room in one’s heart for
more love, it’s also about having room for more pain and guilt. If love
hurts, then polyamory kills.

“I don’t think this works if people aren’t considerate of others, and I
violated that today. I really crossed a line.” I sound like a murderer
trying to talk a victim’s family into feeling sorry for him. “I’m sorry,
Anne, and also sorry, Belle. Sorry, everybody. That’s my check-in.” I
heave a deep sigh.

“Same emotion,” Belle says. “That’s my check-in.”

“Veronika, is there anything you want to say?” I ask, remembering how
communication has saved us in the past.

“No.” Her voice is flat and passionless. Even communication can’t help
us now.

“Anne?”

Silence.

The only woman still talking to me in the car is the GPS navigation
system, who speaks for all of us when she says, “Recalculating.”

“No more sex parties, okay? I don’t even care if we have any more sex.
How would you guys feel if we just spent the rest of this time trying to
get to know each other better?” I ask.

No one replies. Anne stares through the passenger window silently, her
senses registering nothing, flatlined, the embodiment of Henry from
rehab’s mysterious ninth emotion: the death feeling.

In that moment, I hate her. I hate her for not saying anything. I hate
her for silently suffering, just like my mom. I hate her for not
listening to a word we said at the house meeting before, or a thing I
said when inviting her to live with us. I hate her for having completely
unreasonable expectations of me. I hate her for not considering my
feelings in any of this. I hate her for being wounded when I was trying
to take care of my own needs for once. I hate her for loving me, for
wanting to possess me, for embodying everything I’m trying to escape.

And, most of all, I hate her because I feel guilty. I’ve smashed
someone’s already fragile heart to bits.

Excerpt from Belle’s Journal

This experience has been, to put it lightly, an emotional roller
coaster.

When I arrived, I felt as though for the first time in my life I was
free to be me, away from the judgment and potential disappointment of my
family.

So on the second night, when I told Neil it wasn’t working for me, it
was a combination of feelings. I felt like I was disappointing him and
not contributing the way he wanted me to, and it felt like he and the
other girls didn’t want me there. I was also fucking confused that there
were different rules for different people, and it threw me: Why is he
allowed to kiss others in front of me and not the reverse? I was
disappointed that I wasn’t getting to do what I wanted with him (fuck
him senseless). After all, that’s why I came.

Then the Anne drama happened tonight. I could understand where she was
coming from, but it was frustrating! I could see she had some
deep-rooted feelings for Neil. So why did she put herself in this
situation?

After the conversation with Reid, Nicole and I tried to tell Anne not to
come to the play party. We told her that she would get hurt if she came.
I’m going to assume she was thinking: If I do this and go along with it,
Neil will be happy with me and I will get what I want out of the
situation. Basically, she decided to hurt herself and go against
everything she believed in to get the guy.

The whole scenario just bloody confuses me, to be honest: How did she
get those feelings for Neil and how the hell did he not see them?

That whole situation blew up and I was happy to leave—albeit somewhat
begrudgingly. I could tell he wasn’t into it and I still went along with
it. He never needed me to make him hard before. Initially I thought
maybe it was the situation of being surrounded by people. Then it got
obvious: He was doing something he either wasn’t enjoying or didn’t want
to do, which is okay.

I’ll admit that I really didn’t want to go into that room where Anne was
afterward. God, nothing felt more daunting and emotionally fucked up
than to go into that room. But he pleaded with me, so I went. And, yes,
I did plant a fake smile on my face. I felt awkward and like a bully. I
was the bad guy, and that is so against my nature. I don’t go out of my
way to hurt people or be selfish, and I did. I felt very, very scummy,
especially in that car ride home. When no one was talking and I felt
their anger, it was an _oh shit_ moment.

Anne came and spoke to me back at the house afterward. I so didn’t want
to talk to her. I had uncomfortable emotions, and I felt I had knowingly
and willingly hurt her. That was a tough conversation. She just wanted
to keep talking and because I felt guilty, I listened and was there for
her. She talked about being raped by her first boyfriend and I asked her
if Neil knew. She said no. I said Neil wouldn’t have put her in the
situation if he knew, and that she needed to get professional help, and
that hiding it and pretending it didn’t happen was obviously not helping
her life.

I’m in turn upset that I’ve not gotten what I wanted out of this—to jump
his bones. But I gained other things and insight into myself. And I
learned how sex is a massive part of who I am, most likely an addiction.
And it causes me to do things or act a certain way to get it. I need to
work on removing it from its pedestal and not let it be something that’s
all-powerful and consuming, as I believe that’s an unhealthy place for
it to be.

I’m not wishing I hadn’t come and I guess I don’t want to leave. I’m
just attempting to accept that this situation is so very different from
my expectations of it. Everything’s so complicated: four different
people with four different sets of needs and some people so unwilling to
compromise. Everything is just a bit too much to handle all at once
right now.

After dropping Nicole off, we drive home in silence. As we trudge up the
stairs to the apartment, each in our own personal hell, I think about
packing my bags, stuffing them in the car, driving away, and leaving the
girls there. That would be a fucking funny end to this group
relationship: just abandoning them.

_Got a wife and two other wives in San Francisco, Jack / I went out for
a ride and I never went back._

I used to fantasize when I was a teenage virgin about being the only man
on earth and every woman wanting to sleep with me. But now I think it
would be a nightmare: having all those people competing and manipulating
and creating drama, then hurting so many feelings whenever you choose to
sleep with just one or two. You’d be murdered before getting a chance to
enjoy yourself.

Perhaps that’s the price of making your fantasies a reality. You realize
pretty quickly that they were more fun to imagine.

A friend of mine, Tina Jordan, used to date Hugh Hefner, who’s well
known for living with multiple women. On their first date, as he was
courting her with champagne and strawberries in his bedroom, his other
girlfriends got jealous, came to the door, and started pounding on it.
Then they stormed in, yelling at Hefner and Jordan.

Throughout their relationship, Jordan says, even though he was
technically polyamorous, Hefner often snuck around, cheated, broke the
rules—and was almost always caught by his girlfriends. He seemed to
enjoy the drama, she noted. Having women fight over him made him feel
wanted. Maybe that’s the type of guy who likes being the fulcrum.

“I need to talk to you,” Anne says as the others disappear wordlessly to
their rooms.

“Not right now, okay?” I respond, avoiding eye contact.

I walk to the bathroom, brush my teeth, and prepare for another night on
the couch. None of us has had dinner, but I’m too emotionally exhausted
to think about it. I just want to disconnect from everyone. Be alone
with myself.

As I stand with my back to the open door, I brace myself for the kitchen
knife in the spine or the hammer to the skull. Who needs to worry about
Mexican cartels when you have jealous lovers around? They’ll finish the
job much quicker and with more enthusiasm.

As I write this, there’s a story in the news about a Nigerian man with
six wives. He was attacked with knives and sticks by five of them for
paying too much attention to the sixth. According to the article, the
five disgruntled wives demanded that he have sex with all of them, and
then “raped him to death.”

While washing my face, I sense Veronika’s chilly presence behind me,
casting an ominous shadow. Here it comes: the attack. “Can we talk?” she
asks.

It’s an emotional attack. The most dangerous kind. And right now I need
time to myself before I say or do anything else I’ll regret. “Not right
now, okay?”

She pivots wordlessly, bristles past me, and runs a bath for herself
while I retire to my quarantine area on the couch and grab my computer
to take notes. For me, the best way to understand what actually
transpired in any given situation is to write about it until the truth
emerges.

As I’m typing, I hear the thud of Belle’s heels on the floor behind me.
I feel her drop down next to me. I sense her sitting there, falsely
patient, waiting for me to look up. Irritation snakes through my body as
I keep my head down. Now her hand is on my knee, sucking my heat, my
energy, my soul, and leaving in their place just a cold dark void. After
an interminable minute, she speaks: “I need to talk to you.”

I feel like I’m in a horror movie, trapped in a house full of zombies.
And every few steps I take, one’s jumping out at me from around the
corner. But instead of saying “brains,” they’re saying “I need to talk
to you.” And in a way it’s the same desire: to consume my brain. Perhaps
the latter is even worse. At least I can run away from zombies. There’s
no escaping from emotions. But I can try.

“Can we talk later? I need some time to myself right now.”

“I guess rationally I understand that. Irrationally I don’t. I will try
not to let it hurt my feelings.”

Her words are needles of nonsense poking my eardrums. “How’s this
hurting your feelings? I mean, when do I get any alone time? It’s
insane.”

“Is it okay if I cuddle with you while you write, then?”

“From now on, I’m off limits,” I snap. I imagine Anne coming upstairs
and seeing us. “In fact, no one can touch me!”

I cross my hands in the air, forming an X for “off limits.” What was
supposed to be a wild poly pod has turned into a fucking nunnery.

She remains planted next to me stubbornly. So I stare at her with the
full force of my irritation and anger, drilling it deep into her
sockets, trying to drive her away. She came to get her feelings cared
for and instead they’re getting further demolished.

Everything about this situation reminds me of the final months of my
relationship with Ingrid, when her every needy touch and expression made
my skin crawl. Set free to make my wettest dreams come true, I’m right
back in the same situation. Only it’s three times worse.

“Can I just have one hug?” Belle persists. These zombies have a weapon
greater than flesh-ripping strength: It’s called guilt. And so I lift my
arms and let them encircle her, though my nerves itch and my heart
pounds and every cell in my body flees in the opposite direction.
Despite this revolt, I try to give her the affection she needs. As I do,
I realize I have no idea what the boundary is between taking care of my
emotions, wants, and needs and taking care of the emotions, wants, and
needs of others. It seems I’m always way off the mark in one direction
or the other.

After the hug of death, Belle pads away, content. I make the mistake of
thinking that the nightmare is over. But ten minutes later, like the
scene after the end credits of a horror film, Veronika rises out of the
water of the bath, hunts me down in the kitchen, and attacks: “Belle
just ordered Chinese food, but only for herself. How am I going to eat?”

What the fuck: Am I responsible for everyone’s diet and nutrition now?
She figured out how to eat before she met me.

“You’re a big girl. Figure it out for yourself!”

These women just don’t stop going after one another.

She shakes her head and says, “That was mean.”

Once again, she’s right. Where there’s reactivity, there’s a wound. And
I am overreacting to everything.

That’s when I realize: This whole enterprise was doomed from the start.
In my relationship with Ingrid, I felt trapped by her desires and needs.
And so I absurdly deceived myself into thinking that somehow I’d feel
more free in a house with additional women and additional needs.
Polyamory—at least when I’m the fulcrum—is not the answer for a guy with
enmeshment issues. Too many invisible nooses encircling me, tightening
around me, choking me, killing my spirit.

Maybe I’m neither mono nor poly, but just solo.

I gather my strength, enter Belle’s room, and ask her to add enough
dishes to the order so everyone can eat. But five minutes later, she
emerges and whines, “I can’t connect to the Internet.”

Now I’m technical support. Can’t they figure anything out for
themselves? “Give me the phone number and I’ll call them!”

How did Father Yod survive fourteen wives? Or maybe he didn’t—and that’s
why he died at age fifty-three. I should call one of his wives and ask
how he made those 105 relationships (according to the Gauss-Pepper
formula) work.

I get half an hour of alone time until the Chinese food comes. As I’m
setting the table, Belle and Veronika walk in.

“We talked, and between us it’s all good now,” Belle says. “We decided
that Anne needs to go back to Paris. And we came up with an idea
together.”

“What’s that?”

“Veronika wants to have an experience with a guy and a girl with a
strap-on. I’m going to be the girl with the strap-on. And if you want,
you can be the guy.”

I stand there with my jaw open. I’m completely speechless.

I thought I understood life. I thought I understood women. I thought I
was at least starting to understand myself. Clearly I know nothing.

And then Belle asks Veronika, “Is it okay if I fuck you with a
strap-on?”

And Veronika, in her sharp Czech accent, says, “I would prefer not.”

Okay, that’s more like it. One of the girls just poured cold water over
the other’s hopes and fantasies. Evidently I do understand how things
work after all.

“Let Belle fuck you with a strap-on, for chrissake,” I tell her. “In the
spirit of communal living.”

She’s not amused.

The three of us finish dinner in silence. I’ve really outdone myself
with this relationship: Rather than making one person miserable, like my
father made my mother, I’ve made three women miserable.

Afterward, I hear Anne walking up the stairs. I hide in the bathroom.
Emotionally, I’m eight years old right now. But I don’t want to look at
her. It’s like staring into a vortex of guilt, which keeps howling,
“You’re hurting me by not reciprocating my totally irrational love for
you.”

There’s a light tap on the bathroom door. She’s found me. If only I
could flush myself down the toilet and escape through the sewers of San
Francisco. I’d rather see three-foot rats with razor-sharp teeth
dripping with meningitis than face a woman I’ve hurt. But of course I
let her in, because the only thing sharper than those rat teeth is
guilt.

I return to my errant-king’s throne. She sits on the floor in front of
me and says the dreaded three brain-eating words: “Can we talk?”

“Sure, I’m happy you’re speaking again. But before you say anything,
just know that I’m this close”—pinching my thumb and index fingers
almost together—“to losing it.”

“I can either go home tomorrow or stay here for the rest of the time,”
she says. “But if I stay, I expect quality time with you and I need
everyone here to be respectful of my feelings.”

She looks at me hopefully, waiting to see how I’ll respond to this
request that she’s clearly put a lot of time into properly formulating.

And so I give her—sweet, suffering Anne—a piece of my mind. “I think
you’ve been really selfish. You say other people here aren’t being
respectful of your feelings, but have you been respectful of theirs? You
say they can’t touch me, but then you get to touch me? I think you came
here with your own agenda and completely ignored what this living
situation was all about.”

She doesn’t immediately respond, of course. Her lower lip juts out and
she hangs her head and her face puffs and drops of water peel off her
eyes. Eventually, the words dribble out: “So what do you want me to do?”

“Nothing. But just know, if you stay, then I can’t be affectionate with
anyone. I can’t hold anyone’s hand, I can’t kiss anyone, and I can’t
sleep with anyone.” Man, monogamy was better than this.

In Muslim countries where polygamy is allowed, some advocates say that
it keeps husbands from having affairs. I used to think that was just
sophistry, but I now know it to be true. Because any normal person with
three or four wives is going to be too busy and emotionally exhausted
even to consider adding another woman to the mix.

Anne stares at me sympathetically. Then she says, “This can be a growing
experience, and we can become wise from these experiences.”

“Well, I’ve definitely learned a lot from it.”

“I want you to know something,” she continues. For the next few minutes,
she shares her timeline. Her father abandoned the family for a gay
lover; her mother went crazy afterward; her uncle was an alcoholic; her
first boyfriend raped her. Then she concludes, “You hurt me more than
you can comprehend.”

“I didn’t know all that.” My guilt is flowering again. I can’t believe
I’ve been put on that list of horrible traumatizers. Though now I
understand why she hides beneath all that unflattering clothing: It’s
not unlike the sexual anorexic from rehab hiding behind her weight. “I
don’t think I’m healthy for you. But maybe this had to happen so you
could be in reality about who I am and not in a romantic fantasy
anymore.”

And then what does she do: Does she leave? Does she get over it? No. She
puts her hand over mine and drops her head gently into my lap.

We’ve just gone through the entire love-avoidant/love-addict
relationship cycle that Ingrid and I experienced. And I only met Anne a
month ago. It’s accelerated dysfunction for the information age.

Anne wanted her one true love; I wanted my poly partner. We both struck
out. In the dance of infatuation, we see others not as they are, but as
projections of who we want them to be. And we impose on them all the
imaginary criteria we think will fill the void in our hearts. But in the
end, this strategy leads only to suffering. It’s not a relationship when
the other person is completely left out of it.

“I’m sorry about the situation,” she says. “If you want me to stay, say
it. Please be sure you’re in my heart whatever happens. Everybody can
make mistakes. And just so you know, I forgive you.”

The heart of a woman is a beautiful thing. I’m ashamed by my previous
words and behavior. “That means a lot,” I tell her. “Let’s just go to
sleep and take some alone time to process everything that happened
tonight, and we’ll talk more in the morning.”

Anne doesn’t respond. Instead, she just lies in my lap content, like
Hercules. And I fall asleep on the toilet. Like the piece of shit I am.

37

At some indeterminate hour of the night, I stumble out of the bathroom
and make my way to the couch. A dream still lingers in the fog of my
brain: I was driving a new car, but I lost control and smashed into a
wall.

I pull the sheet over myself and set the alarm on my phone for noon. I
have a call to make to Hawaii. To Isis Aquarian. One of Father Yod’s
wives.

I wake up shivering and wash my face with warm water, then call Isis and
tell her I’m a fan. I’m not sure what that means, but she seems happy to
hear it. So I let her know how I got her phone number (by contacting the
editor of the book on Father Yod) and explain my current situation.

“It’s not easy,” she agrees. “After Father died and the family
dispersed, no one was able to make it work with multiple partners.”

I press her for an hour with every question I can come up with about
life with Father Yod and what made it work then. She tells me that
Father Yod was previously in traditional marriages. He started a
vegetarian restaurant and a commune called the Source with his fourth
wife, and the group eventually grew to two hundred people living
together. Soon after, he realized that the rules of his relationship had
to change.

“He’d been giving hints, but Robin”—his actual wife—“kept getting
dramatic and freaking out,” Isis explains. “She started hanging on him
all the time and following him around because she knew it was going to
happen. And then one day he just announced he was going to have extra
women. It was his journey and he was the boss. But he was a very
benevolent boss.”

It’s odd—she describes him almost the exact same way Kamala Devi
described herself, as a “benevolent” authoritarian. I feel for his legal
wife, the love addict whose heart he had to break in order to live his
poly dream. But at least he was honest with her. I imagine that most men
would do something similar if they became a virtual god to a community
of free-spirited women.

What made the ensuing group relationship successful, Isis explains, is
that unlike my situation, the women had already been living together in
the community, so they were connected and bonded with one another in
advance. In addition, many had come from ashrams, intentional
communities, and hippie lifestyles where they were used to more communal
relationships. So the wives all got along—except, of course, for his
legal wife, who wasn’t happy with any of this.

“Was there any kind of hierarchy among the wives?” I ask. “Was one of
them his primary?

“No. We each had our own specific role: Makushla was his mother angel
and took on a mother role. I had his back as his bulldog and the
archivist saving his legacy. Others had the role of having his child. We
all had our role and within that position, we were the primary.”

Now for the most awkward question: “And, um, how did the sex part work?
Was it all together or one at a time or . . . what?”

Isis tells me the wives never had sex with each other—only one-on-one
with him.

She goes on to explain that he chose each of his wives because he
believed he had karma from a previous lifetime with them to resolve.
“Some of the women were sixteen, but they had past lifetime threads with
him,” Isis elaborates. Evidently the Achilles’ heel of cult leaders is
that they think they’re above the law. It’s disturbing how, as soon as
they reach the pinnacle of their power, one of the first things so many
choose to do is sleep with—and often control the development of—underage
girls. Even one of Muhammad’s wives was a preteen. “Of course every
woman in the family wanted to be with him, but he coupled many of them
with other people they had karma with. So other men had multiple wives
also.”

“And you never fought about who got the front seat in the car?”

“That never happened because we were living as spiritual beings, not in
our animal energy.”

Apparently Father Yod did exactly what Orpheus Black recommended to
me—and what I didn’t do with my quad. He instilled his partners with a
strong sense of family and of the future. In Father Yod’s case, it was
the belief that they were following an earthly god and ushering in a new
era of humanity—in which they and their children would be prophets of
the coming Aquarian Age. As a result, few people wanted to leave this
exalted sanctum. It also helped that they donated all their money and
property when they came to live with him, so they were pretty much
stuck.

As I continue talking with Isis, I understand that what it takes to
enjoy being the fulcrum is a high degree of narcissism and an unwavering
certainty that your needs and beliefs are more important and enlightened
than those of the rest of your community—and quite possibly the world.

Much to my dismay, as this picture emerges, I see that Father Yod may be
more a model of what to avoid than to emulate: He demanded everyone’s
worldly goods, rigorously controlled his followers, and put their lives
and their children’s lives in jeopardy by not allowing them to use
medicine because of his spiritual beliefs.

And this, sadly, may be the norm. In fact, most of the communes known
historically as sexually liberal were actually very strict on the
matter. At Oneida, a nineteenth-century utopian community that
considered monogamy a sin, a committee approved hookups to make sure
people weren’t coupling off, and men were forbidden from having orgasms
during intercourse without authorization. Similarly, the Kerista commune
in San Francisco, where terms like _compersion_ and _polyfidelity_ were
invented in the seventies, was another group run by a narcissist with
strict rules, which included forbidding members from masturbating or
having group sex.

“When he flew off the cliff, he was done and ready to move on,” Isis
says, referring to the hang-gliding accident that killed Father Yod.
“And he left us because we wouldn’t let go of him. However, to this day,
I’ve kept my thread with him. I’m still his woman. I haven’t been with
anyone else.”

I’m astounded by her dedication: He died four decades ago. I wonder if
she also fits the love addict template. And if ultimately Father
Yod—whose pseudonym is clearly a magnet for abandoned women—felt so
consumed by the pressure of being the fulcrum for so many people that he
eliminated himself.

“Do you have any final words of advice for anyone doing something
similar now?” I ask.

“It made sense in the time frame of the sixties and seventies, but now I
think it’s a foreign thing. If you brought a woman into that situation
today, I don’t think it would work. Good luck, sweetie.”

So that’s it: Just good luck attempting to pull off the impossible?

I hang up, and look for more case studies online. In Hebrew, the word
for co-wives is _tzara,_ which tellingly also translates as _rival_. And
in ancient Egypt, second wives were called _esirtu,_ which means _rival_
as well. Even Muhammad’s wives were jealous. Stories of them smashing
dishes, conspiring against a favorite wife, and gossiping about one
another abound.

And then there’s the Mormon prophet Brigham Young, who, like Father Yod,
opened up his monogamous marriage soon after he felt a religious
calling, except that he took on an astonishing fifty-three additional
spouses. And they were almost the death of him. At one point, he told
his wives to leave if they weren’t happy, proclaiming, “I will go into
heaven alone rather than have [you all] scratching and fighting around
me.”

As I read more about history’s great fulcrums, which differ greatly from
what I fear was an immature fantasy, I hear Belle talking to Anne in the
living room.

“Do you want to sleep with Neil?” Belle asks.

“Yes,” Anne tenderly replies.

“If you don’t let us have sex with him, then you can’t have sex with
him. It’s not fair for you to want to keep him for yourself.”

At least Belle and Anne are taking Pepper’s advice and working things
out among themselves. Still, it’s weird to hear them negotiating and
manipulating to sleep with me as though I were some kind of prize.
Perhaps Isis is still faithful to Father Yod not just because of the
depth of her love for him, but also because she’s still trying to win,
to prove that she’s the best wife.

I wonder why, after I completely fucked her over last night, Anne would
still want to sleep with me. Or maybe that _is_ the reason: Being fucked
over is what she’s used to. As long as she, like Isis today, is in love
with someone who can’t reciprocate, she may always be sad but her heart
will always be safe—because no one can ever truly get to it.

Perhaps what I need to do is accept rivalry as an expected part of any
new group relationship, then learn how to best manage it. So before
venturing into the zombie lair, I decide to call one last person:
Orpheus Black. He’s figured out how to make a group marriage work in the
modern world. He’ll know how to handle the competitiveness.

“It’s actually just Indigo and me right now,” he responds when I ask for
advice.

“What happened to the rest of your wives?”

“We’re separated.” He speaks these two words as if they’re a
confession—of regret, vulnerability, failure. I can relate.

“What happened to family and the future?”

“Someone stabbed it in the back.”

After some prodding, he tells me that one of their former lovers spread
rumors about him and manipulated his wives against him. The venom rotted
the group and harmony turned to drama, so he decided to let his two
non-legal wives go.

Immediately afterward, as a result of the stress and strain, he woke up
one morning with amnesia. Not only could he not remember a thing that
had happened, but he couldn’t even recognize his actual wife, Indigo.
This lasted two weeks.

Though he tells me he plans to rebuild his family again, I feel
vindicated that even Orpheus, with all his experience and confidence,
couldn’t keep three women together and stay sane. Clearly, being a
fulcrum is not easy even for very experienced people.

When everyone’s awake and dressed, we take our usual places in the
living room for a much-needed house meeting. I have a lot of apologizing
to do.

But before I can speak, Anne beats me to it. “I’d like to say
something,” she begins. “I made a mistake.”

“What mistake is that?” I ask.

“I want to stay. I promise to share things.” She glances at Belle, who
nods her approval. “I’m willing to share you. Yes, I want to stay.”

One thing about polyamory is that it’s never dull or predictable.
Belle’s negotiation was evidently a success.

“You manipulated her!” Veronika cuts in, glaring at Belle. “It’s not
fair to do that to Anne just so we can sleep with Neil.”

If you’d asked any of them a month ago what they’d do in this exact
situation, every one probably would’ve said she’d leave and never speak
to me again. Yet here they are, breaking every law of logic,
self-respect, and common sense. And perhaps it’s a dynamic I set up by
Svengali-ing these smitten women into playing a role in my sick fantasy.

I look at the strength in Veronika’s eyes, the desire in Belle’s, and
the hope in Anne’s. And I feel, for the first time since we arrived,
completely clearheaded. Since last night, I’ve written, rested, and
talked to Isis and Orpheus. Now is the time to make a powerful decision.

Father Yod made things work by not asking for or needing anyone’s
permission to set the rules for the family. Same with Hugh Hefner. Same
with Oneida and Kerista and Orpheus Black. Everyone was subservient to
the mission and the word of the benevolent dictator in charge. If
someone didn’t like the rules, they were presumably free to leave. So
all I have to do is lay down the law—and that’s how things will be going
forward.

But I’m not Father Yod. I’m not Hugh Hefner. I’m not even Orpheus Black.
And after what I’ve learned this week, I don’t think I’d ever want to be
them. I’m done with my Father Yod fantasies. There’s only one right
thing to do.

“Here’s what I think,” I tell Anne. “You very well could just suck it up
and share me. But you’d be harming your spirit if you did. That wouldn’t
be true to who you are.”

She looks into my eyes imploringly. “I think I can handle it.”

“You can handle the hurt and the pain? Is that what you’re saying?”

“Yes. Some things are more important.” She speaks quietly, her body
rigid but quivering, as if about to collapse into the black hole of
itself.

“I don’t want you to be a martyr. You tried that last night and look
what happened. It’s time to do what’s best for Anne. And if you were to
ask me what I think is best for Anne, it would probably be best that she
goes home.”

“But I can change,” she protests, steeling her nerves, summoning her
power. “I can work on controlling my emotions.”

“If you had a daughter and she was in this same situation, would you
tell her to try to control her emotions or to trust them?”

She thinks about it for a moment, then says softly, without the bravado
of earlier, “To trust her emotions.”

“Then why don’t you take your mother’s advice? You’re a healer, and you
spend a lot of time healing other people, but maybe it’s time to start
healing yourself.”

I suddenly realize that those feelings of hatred I had for Anne the
night before weren’t actually about her at all. They were about my
mother. And when Anne looks at me with those loving eyes, she’s not
Stalin trying to send me to an emotional gulag or a zombie trying to eat
my brains. She just loves me. Whether rightly or wrongly, it doesn’t
matter. It’s just love. That’s it. Nothing to be afraid of.

The whole time I’ve been living with these three, I’ve seen love as a
demand: “I need to talk to you,” “Don’t text when you’re with me,” “Tell
her to order food for me,” “Don’t hold anyone else’s hand,” “It’s not
fair,” “My turn to sit in the front seat.”

I’ve seen love as a padded cell designed to take away my freedom. And
that’s because my “long-suffering” mother used love to exert control
over me, which she enforced with guilt. In my relationship with Ingrid,
I think as I sit illuminated by the beams of six expectant eyes, I
interpreted her love as control and resisted it. First through cheating,
and when that got shut down, through resentment, fantasizing, and
emotional distancing. My whole life, I’ve been fighting against love for
my freedom.

No wonder I’ve never been married, engaged, or even had a love that
didn’t wane after the initial infatuation period.

It’s a depressing realization. I wonder why I’m just figuring it out
now. Maybe I needed a situation this intense and overwhelming to force
it to the surface.

I take a deep, Reid-like breath and look Anne in the eyes without
resistance for the first time in days. And I apologize sincerely for my
behavior. “I’d like to make amends for what happened yesterday,” I tell
her. “There’s a process I recently went through called chair work. And
it helps people get the bad things that happened to them out of their
body and their psyche. I can sign you up for that, and help pay for it
if you need me to. Because, whatever happened to you in the past, you
should have professionals helping you treat it.”

Gazing into her eyes without fear of my own annihilation, I notice a
beautiful, loving, gentle soul looking back at me; a woman who’s gone
through hell and miraculously managed to keep her heart pure. And I feel
bad for not seeing her as she is, but through my own distorted,
reactionary lens. I should have behaved like this the whole time and
seen the beauty in each of my partners instead of the flaws, empathized
with their needs rather than feeling trapped by them.

And I most definitely should have done this with Ingrid instead of
regressing every time she got too close.

“But don’t you want me to stay so you can see if this type of
relationship can work for you?” Anne asks. Now suddenly she gets what
all this has been about. Apparently being understood leads to
understanding.

“Honestly, my work is done. I’m sucked dry. I just don’t have the
constitution for a relationship like this. I don’t think it would ever
work for me with anybody.”

I guess I’ve got my answer.

Now what do I do?

Excerpt from Anne’s Journal

This week was my first time to the U.S. It was an adventure. Something
new with much unknown. And for the first time, the unknown was not scary
to me. My deep intuition was that it would bring me really important
things.

I told Neil I wanted to be an experienced woman. But at the time, I had
only a vague idea of how. I knew I wanted sex. And I was thinking about
having new experiences, for instance being with another woman.

But when I arrived, I became afraid of being hurt and losing my
self-esteem. And I didn’t feel that breaking my boundaries would be a
good idea. Will I be ready one day to break some of them? I don’t know.
I think I need time, and a reassuring and respectful context, to be able
to disinhibit. Though I know if we had a normal relationship, it would
have bored me and would not have been an effective way to evolve.

I could tell on the first day that there were many differences between
us four. That created some misunderstanding. Seeing everybody touching,
stroking, and whatever was weird to me. It felt like I’d landed on
another planet. That was not the kind of relationship I imagined we
would be having. Before I came, he told me there was something like that
happening, but I didn’t let my inner voice prepare me.

During our time together, we had to make choices. We hesitated and we
didn’t always know what was best for us. A great lesson this taught me
was that if we place ourselves in our heart to make choices in new
situations, we can’t make any mistakes.

I think that one of the most important things I became aware of through
this experience is what it means to be a woman.

Neil told me to listen to my heart and inner feelings. He had an
insightful remark that was like: “If it was your daughter, what would
you tell her to do? Behave with yourself as if you were your own
mother.”

I had a dream five years ago in which my boyfriend at the time gave me
half of a moon. After that, I left him to go to a room where a mature
man with a shaved head and a dark beard was waiting on a big red bed. I
met him and he gave me the second half of the moon. I now know what that
dream means. The moon symbolizes the woman and the mother. And now I can
say that the man on the bed was Neil, even if I didn’t know him at that
time.

So thanks to this experience and to Neil’s advice, I finally understand
and feel what being a woman is: to become my own mother.

I definitely feel the change. Since I now consider myself my own mother,
I don’t need to mother others anymore. I can now be in a relationship
without trying to help someone. They can father themselves.

We laughed a lot in the last hours we spent together. I offered to do
acupuncture on everyone, and I was glad to see that it comforted all of
us and that we were finally at peace together.

When he dropped me off at the airport, Neil told me that he was worried
we had wasted our time. And I answered that there was no wasted time but
just time. And time is useful to experience and grow. This unusual
relationship was a great thing to confront my issues, to know myself
better, and to help me change. I can truly say it brought me a lot more
than a normal one would have.

40

Formerly proud and erect, it has gone limp. Where once it was bursting
with vitality, it now looks brown and lifeless.

The Survivor is not surviving very well in my care. I can’t let Ingrid’s
indestructible plant die. I have to at least be able to take care of
something successfully. As soon as I return home from San Francisco and
see the neglected state it’s in, I water it, move it into direct
sunlight, and rush out to buy vitamin-enriched soil for it.

While I’m out, I check in with some of the guys from rehab. After
reaching his eighteenth month of involuntary celibacy, Adam decided to
contact Lorraine for additional counseling. Charles is separated and
living in a motel. And Calvin tells me that things have been a disaster
since he brought Mariana and his son to L.A. She’s been depressed and
misses Brazil, and he’s been angry because he feels trapped and forced
into the relationship by the child.

“Mariana wants to go back to Brazil, and I haven’t been trying to
discourage her,” he confesses. “But I’m going to miss Flavio. Looking
into the innocent eyes of your own child in the morning and seeing a big
smile spread across his face is sublime! I hope you get to experience it
one day.”

“I hope so too,” I tell him. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt that kind of
joy.”

While Calvin’s predicament was foreseeable, Troy’s current situation no
one saw coming. Not only did he start seeing his affair partner again,
but she wants him to be monogamous with her.

“She wants you to break up with your wife?” I ask Troy to clarify.

“No, she knows I can’t do that. She just doesn’t want me having sex with
my wife.”

“That’s insane. What did you tell her?”

“Well, I said no at first. Then she went on a date with some guy and it
drove me crazy, so I gave in.”

Fear of loss: It has motivated many weak people to make commitments they
shouldn’t have. “So you stopped sleeping with your wife?”

“If I was Adam, that would be easy to do.” He chuckles cruelly. “But my
wife and I have a decent sex life.”

I struggle to get my head around what he’s saying. “So let me see if I
understand this. You’re cheating on your wife with your affair partner.
And now you’re _also_ cheating on your affair partner with your wife?”

“Welcome to my life.”

That evening, I meet my friend Melanie for dinner. I’ve known her longer
than anyone I’ve dated. She’s been with me through it all, giving me the
hard truth after every breakup—just as I’ve given her advice every time
a man she likes gets flaky the moment a relationship appears on the
horizon of their casual dating.

“Neil,” she exclaims when I tell her about San Francisco. “You can’t go
on like this. Don’t you want to get married and have children?”

“Yes, more than anything. I just don’t want to end up like my parents. I
want to find someone who adds to my life rather than limits it.”

“I know someone like that,” she says, brushing hair out of her face. She
has a long black mane that cascades halfway down a frame so thin that an
enthusiastic hug could snap it in two.

“Who?” I ask excitedly, hoping she knows someone perfect to set me up
with.

And she answers with the one word I’m not ready to hear: “Ingrid.”

I sigh and mutter something that sounds like “I know.”

“She was so perfect for you, Neil.” Melanie draws out the end of the
sentence like a little girl whining for a puppy. “She’s the only
girlfriend of yours I met who loved you for you. I’m sure if you just
showed her you could commit, she’d come back.”

“That’s the problem. We have two very different definitions of
commitment.”

I think about San Francisco, and wonder what my relationship with Ingrid
would be like if I could hold onto the lessons I learned about love. If
there’s anyone in the world I’d want to have a child with, it’s Ingrid.
I flash back to watching the affection and tenderness she showed her
shelter dog, Hercules—and think about how huge her heart is, how playful
her spirit is, how great a mother she’d be. If only she’d been willing
to budge just a little bit on the monogamy issue.

Or maybe Ingrid was right to stand her ground. Because right now, I feel
like her prediction has come true: I am dying in the wild.

“You’re sending the universe mixed messages,” Melanie lectures. “You
keep saying you want a family, but you’re surrounding yourself with
people you could never have one with. Can’t you just let go of the whole
nonmonogamy thing? For Ingrid.”

Letting go would make my life so much easier. Maybe this whole thing was
a bad idea. “Part of me really wants to. But if I tried to go back to
Ingrid now and it actually worked out, I’d always wonder _what if_?”

_What if_ I quit too soon, just before finding someone as open as Nicole
or Sage? _What if_ I found a nonmonogamous version of Ingrid? _What if_
there’s a stone I left unturned and it’s the right stone? And most
terrifying of all, w_hat if_ I return out of fear and failure but not
love and commitment?

_What if, what if, what if_ . . . It’s the ambivalent’s mating call.

“You’re going to lose her, Neil. A girl like that doesn’t stay single
for long.”

Melanie excuses herself to go to the bathroom. When she returns a few
minutes later, she looks distraught. “You’re too late,” she says,
holding up her phone. “I just checked Ingrid’s profile.”

“What do you mean?” A cold sweat prickles through my skin.

“I hate to say it, but it looks like she has a boyfriend now.”

She shows me a picture of a shirtless guy holding Hercules. He’s a cross
between James Dean and Thor, with hard ripples in places I never knew
could grow muscles. In comparison to him, I look as appealing as the
Hunchback of Notre-Dame. That’s not being self-deprecating; it’s just a
fact.

Suddenly I feel profoundly alone. Not until this moment do I realize
that I’d been assuming—so vainly, selfishly, and irrationally—that
Ingrid was waiting for me or there would be some way to return to the
relationship if things didn’t work out. Whoever this superstud is, I
hope that he’s worthy of her heart, that he doesn’t have doubts, that
his skin doesn’t crawl when she dotes on him, that he doesn’t text
random women or jerk off to PornHub at the slightest provocation, and
that he loves Hercules instead of seeing him as a symbol of the
hypocrisy of monogamy. I’m sure Ingrid looks back on our relationship as
one long mistake.

I look at Melanie sitting across from me, trying to figure out what to
say to make me feel better. And I fight back the sadness, the fear, the
emptiness.

It wasn’t the right relationship for me, I console myself. It was
unhealthy. Love addict and love avoidant. Textbook dysfunction.

“Well, I guess that settles it, then,” I tell Melanie with a smile as
convincing as my mom’s. “There’s no going back.”

It doesn’t matter what it takes or what I have to do anymore. I’m going
to find a relationship style that works for me, even if it kills me.

And, as it turns out, it almost does.

A wise polyamorist once told him, “Date your own species, Neil!”

_But what is my species? he wondered._

He was alone in life. He had just returned from San Francisco, where he
had discovered that being a fulcrum was not his species. But he had
learned a lot. And he had an idea.

[image]

He visited the most successful commune in the country. And he stayed
there a week, talking to everyone. Some members had been there for over
forty years.

“Our philosophy is that life is perfect and I am perfect,” said Ilana.

“When you live here, you don’t ever have to do anything you don’t want
to do,” said Colin.

They called their community “an experiment in pleasurable group living.”

And the living seemed pleasurable there.

[image]

So he wrote his own manifesto on group relationships.

And he moved into the tree house that he had looked at with Rick a long
time ago.

Nicole and James joined him there.

His friends Lawrence and Leah from the polyamory meet-up moved in.

So did his friend Violet, her new lover Angela, and three others.

Everyone was in some type of open relationship.

In the mornings, they did yoga and tai chi.

In the afternoons, they met with teachers to learn intimacy, sensuality,
and a powerful method of relating to one another called nonviolent
communication.

And in the evenings, they played.

_Life was pleasurable._

But Pepper warned him: “Group relationships of more than four people
rarely work. You have an exploding complexity problem.”

[image]

Pepper was right.

One afternoon, a housemate’s jealous boyfriend had a psychotic break
with reality and almost killed him with an ax.

Unfortunately, his assailant had missed the point of the nonviolent
communication lessons.

When it was all over, he looked at what he had made.

And it was better than the San Francisco house.

But even with the assailant and his girlfriend gone, living in the
commune was a full-time job.

It took a lot of work, communication, organization, and patience.

_This was not his species._

He was alone again. But he had an idea.

[image]

“I should step into a relationship that already exists rather than
trying to create my own,” he said. “This way, I don’t have to worry
about making it work. It will already be working.”

He suggested that Violet and her lover Angela stay with him for a little
longer.

They did everything and went everywhere together.

And then they went to bed together.

They became a poly triad.

And it was nice because he wasn’t the fulcrum: Violet was.

So there was no competition.

Pepper called it a “threesome vacation” and said it would never work in
the long run.

[image]

Pepper was right.

Angela was just enjoying herself between serious relationships.

And Violet, well, she had a small drinking problem.

When it was all over, he looked at what he had made.

And it was better than the commune.

But it was more fun than it was real.

_This was not his species._

He was alone again. But he had an idea.

[image]

He went to dinner with a successful bachelor friend.

“Think of the woman you’ve had the wildest sex with,” his friend said.

He did.

“Now think about the woman you’ve had the best relationship with,” his
friend said.

He did.

“They’re not the same person, am I right?” his friend said.

His friend was right.

“Your problem is that you still think of love and sex as things that
have to go together,” his friend said. “You need to separate them. Start
a family with a good platonic friend who’s your own age and keep
sleeping with whoever you want.”

His friend had an interesting point.

“It’s like having a divorce but without the marriage,” his friend
concluded.

[image]

He asked his ladyfriends if they were interested. He visited websites
for women seeking sperm donors. And he soon found someone special.

“I am a healthy, happy, successful professional woman who recently woke
up one day and yelled, ‘I forgot to have children!’” she wrote to him.
“Now I find myself with the very real possibility that I might not find
my soulmate, yet refusing to give up on the great gift of motherhood.”

[image]

He met her for dinner.

“I’m an engineer, but I don’t want my child to be all left brain,” she
said. “And you’re a writer and right brain, so this is perfect.”

“You have brown eyes,” she continued. “So do I.I’d prefer blue eyes, but
it’s not a dealbreaker.”

She went through nearly every aspect of his appearance and personality,
remarking on which ones she wanted the baby to have and which ones she
didn’t.

This is a little weird, he thought.

But Pepper said that co-parenting arrangements can be very successful,
and that this relationship could actually work.

[image]

Pepper was right.

He looked over what he was about to make.

And unlike the triad, this was very real.

But he couldn’t go through with it.

He had learned too much about trauma to be comfortable bringing a child
into the world out of desperation rather than love.

_This was not his species._

He was alone again. And he had no more ideas.

[image]

He looked over the last few months of his life.

He had taken three women he barely knew and tried to start a harem with
them.

He had taken nine random people, put them in a house, encouraged them to
be together at all times, and expected them to get along perfectly.

He had taken a functional alcoholic and her love-addicted friend, and
expected them to form a stable triad.

And he had taken a woman who was trying to customize a child as if she
were ordering it from a build-a-burger restaurant, and expected her to
be a great mother.

That’s when he saw that he hadn’t been in any real relationships since
leaving Ingrid. He’d just been creating controlled experiments. And they
never had a chance of working.

Why was he in such a hurry? Perhaps his biological alarm clock was
ringing—so loudly, it was drowning out his common sense.

[image]

“You can’t force a relationship to happen,” he finally understood. “You
just have to make a space in your heart for one, then let go of all
expectations, agendas, and control.”

And that’s when he found his species. . . .

[image]

This is how it goes.

We wake up together. Sometimes there’s another woman under the covers
with us; sometimes there isn’t.

She cooks breakfast, I make smoothies, and we all feast in bed.

Once we’re alone, she and I make love again. It is better, stronger, and
more connected than it was with our play partner there. Multiples are
for adventure, but one-on-one is for connection.

We shower—sometimes together, sometimes not.

I spend the day writing. She goes to trapeze school or acting class or
works on her online business. There’s always something she’s excited
about doing. From one week to another, it’s not usually the same thing.
Her life passion is simply passion.

When the sun sets, we head to dinner. She drives; I deejay. Some nights,
we have dinner for two. Other nights, we meet friends. Those friends
usually include a few women we’ve met together.

If we’re in the mood for an adventure, we adjourn to a bar or club.
Afterward, we bring as many women back to the tree house as we can. When
clothes start coming off, whoever is not into it leaves. Oddly, they
usually apologize for not participating as they depart, as if it’s a
moral failing of theirs, and they promise to be more fun next time.
Sometimes they return; sometimes they don’t. If we choose to have a
quiet night after dinner instead, we return home, we watch a movie, we
fuck, and we talk about the future. Not always in that order.

She’s so quickly become a part of my life that sometimes it feels like a
dream. Everything I enjoy—sex, music, surfing, reading, writing,
learning, traveling—she now enjoys with me. And everything I don’t
enjoy—cooking, driving in L.A. traffic, transcribing my _Rolling Stone_
interviews—she’s started doing for me. Sometimes she seems too perfect,
as if she’s been spawned by some sort of nonmonogamous _Weird
Science_–type experiment.

I’m fairly certain she had a life before we met. But I can’t seem to
remember what it was. I can barely remember what mine was. She hasn’t
been back to her home in a month. It may not even exist anymore. I
recall asking Lorraine in rehab what was wrong with a single man
enjoying his intensity, but I never imagined that two people could be in
the same box enjoying that intensity together:

[image]

“You know,” I tell her one night, “I’ve spent months trying to figure
out what kind of relationship is natural to me. Whether it’s monogamy or
polyamory or a group relationship or whatever. But I think I realized
what I like.”

“This?” she replies joyfully. “An adventure relationship! I think that’s
what I was looking for when we first met. Not defining it as monogamy or
polyamory or swinging, but just having fun together without having to be
part of some stupid social scene.”

I appear to have found my species, not to mention the heart connection I
told Rick about.

And so one of my first dates in this world becomes my last: Sage from
Bliss.

42

It began while I was in the triad. Sage found my email address online,
contacted me to say she’d be in Los Angeles, and left me her phone
number.

Of all the women I’d met since breaking up with Ingrid, she was the only
one who shared most of my values, who I regretted blowing it with, and
who, though admittedly it may have had something to do with the ecstasy,
I could imagine a long future with.

I met Sage for dinner a few weeks later. “What happened at Bliss?” I
immediately asked. “I thought you were miserable.”

“I thought you were. I kept thinking I was ruining the vibe because I
wasn’t as high as you guys. You were all having fun, and I just kept
getting more tired and irritable.”

It was a lesson in projection. We hadn’t truly seen each other that
night—just reflections of the stories we were telling ourselves.

It’s hard to recall what else we discussed as we ate, because the hours
flew by breathlessly. Not only could we not stop talking, we couldn’t
stop looking, laughing, lusting. With her metallic red hair, her
charismatic self-assurance, and her
I-just-drank-five-energy-drinks-but-I-only-have-eyes-for-you
personality, she sparked like a human Tesla coil.

That first date ended in a foursome with my old friend and commune-mate
Leah and a heavily tattooed ex-girlfriend of Sage’s named Winter. I
watched as Sage attacked Winter—eating her out, fingering her, spanking
her, then flipping her over and fingering her from behind—and I thought,
“I’ve met my match.”

Soon, Sage, Leah, and Winter started going down on me—passing it,
fighting over it, sharing it, talking dirty. When Winter artfully
wrapped her necklace around it, playing with the tension, I couldn’t
hold out anymore. As they licked me and each other clean, I thought,
This is the greatest experience of my life. All that time and money
wasted on sex addiction therapy, all that drama and misery in San
Francisco, even the attempted murder at the love commune—every disaster,
misstep, and tragedy—it was all worth it for these few minutes.

I often reflect on Rick’s warning that on their deathbeds, people always
think about love and family. But I believe I will also be thinking about
this moment. We are sexual beings; it was my sexual zenith.

I’d like to say that there was some negative outcome or consequence,
that this was the nadir of my addiction, that it was fundamentally
flawed because there was no true intimacy and we didn’t wait seventeen
dates before touching. But it wasn’t. There were no negative
consequences.

Or so I thought: People are such good liars, they even fool themselves
sometimes.

Just before sunrise, as Sage and I made love once again, Leah and Winter
slipped out to leave us alone. A few hours later, Lawrence texted,
“Sounds like a great time last night. I’m very happy you and Leah
finally had a chance to connect.”

I thought carefully of the right response that would show appreciation
without being either awkward or crude, so I wrote: “It was really a
great experience on a number of levels, including that it was part of a
good friendship with both of you.”

Evidently it was the right answer, because he responded: “That’s exactly
what I was thinking. Poignant. I really appreciate our friendship.”

He is the definition of compersion.

Of all my sexual experiences since Ingrid, this was the only one that
was wholly enjoyable—before, during, and after. Perhaps that’s because,
outside of an irrepressible hope that Sage would somehow still be
interested in me, I had no relationship agenda. In fact, it was Sage who
instigated the foursome that night.

In the weeks that follow, my closets and drawers fill with Sage’s
clothes and her room in Brooklyn empties. There was a missing piece in
my life—for romance, for passion, for companionship, for understanding,
for connection, for freedom within a partnership—and Sage somehow senses
it and molds herself right into that shape. Even needs I didn’t know I
had or would enjoy, she begins filling.

Meanwhile, our adventures pile up. We do things I haven’t even seen in
porn clips, things that made me want to do books with rock bands just so
I could live vicariously through them, things I didn’t know were
physically or geometrically possible.

I never would have imagined that my sex life would become better,
wilder, and more varied in a relationship than it was at the peak of my
singledom. Finally, after everyone said it was impossible, I’m having my
cake and eating it too.

Even Pepper gives the relationship a positive prognosis: “It’s more
common and it’s sustainable because everything you’re doing with other
people is short-term and transient.”

Yet most incredibly of all, the adventures are only a supplement to what
appears to be a growing bond between Sage and me. In fact, perhaps the
least healthy part of the relationship isn’t the sex, but the fact that
we’re never apart. For the first time since breaking up with Ingrid, it
feels legitimately possible to live happily and nonmonogamously ever
after.

43

However, as we hit the three-month mark—that inevitable point when
relationships begin to get real—I notice a change in Sage’s behavior.
It’s so subtle at first, it wouldn’t hold up in a court of law as an
actual change. But I see it in the way she looks at me. It seems not
loving anymore, but like someone trying to play the part of loving.

At first, I wonder if it’s just in my imagination, stemming from a sense
of unworthiness or the love avoidant in me trying to sabotage the
relationship.

But then one day, when we return from a trip to New York, she walks into
the house and opens the refrigerator. Something has gone putrid and is
rotting. As she smells it, fire truck and ambulance sirens ring shrilly
from the street outside. She screams. It comes out of nowhere—a
room-shaking, from-the-soul shriek. It’s not directed at the sirens, the
refrigerator, me, or anything specific, but at the universe. Her voice
drowns out the noise, the smell, my thoughts.

“What’s wrong?” I ask as she sits on the couch afterward, sobbing.

She wipes her nose. She looks up at me with those loving but not loving
eyes. She says, “I’ve been reading my diary—and I miss me.”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know exactly. I guess sometimes I miss my wild days, when I was
single and could just do whatever I wanted.”

Only too late do I realize why things have felt off lately. She cooks,
she drives, she transcribes my interviews, she brings in a constant
parade of women. I have my freedom—a caked-out relationship completely
on my terms and on my turf—and what does she really have? Just me.

She’s been so busy taking care of my needs, she’s completely neglected
hers. In fact, I don’t even know what her needs are. I thought we were
being wild, but I guess that to her, I was just being predictable, male,
and selfish, and taking her for granted.

So I tell Sage what I wish Ingrid had said to me: “Why don’t you be free
then? We should both be able to do whatever we want. Why should the fact
that we’re dating keep you from that?”

And that’s how our relationship becomes a truly open one.

It will lead to more pain than I could possibly imagine.

_I_ have done it all—harems, communes, swinging, pujas, moresomes. And
yet I haven’t.

Since leaving the cage of monogamy, I’ve searched for sexual
freedom—and, on a few occasions, perhaps even found it. Yet not once
have I given my partner comparable freedom. Though I haven’t kept anyone
shackled to me by rules, promises, and fears, the situation never arose
on its own. And, on some level, I’ve been grateful for that.

But reality has caught up with me and delivered the news that freedom is
not just for parties of one. You can have your cake and you can eat it,
but one day you’re going to have to share it, too.

Sage and I are at a fancy tapas restaurant in Los Angeles with my former
commune-mates Lawrence and Leah as well as three of Sage’s friends from
her weekly acting class. The hostess leads us to a large circular
table—the kind Corey Feldman would put in a hotel room. I sit next to
Leah and Lawrence; two guys from Sage’s class flank my other side.

Sage arrives at the table last, humming happily to herself. She’s
wearing white shorts and a tight black baby tee with sleeves that stop
just below her shoulders. She doesn’t just walk to the table, she
swaggers.

She looks for a seat beside me and seems disappointed when she doesn’t
find one. So instead she sits across from me, next to the third person
from her class. He’s over six feet tall, with wavy black hair and the
whitest teeth I’ve ever seen. He introduces himself as Donald.

I’ve never met anyone named Donald before, most likely because any
reasonable person would shorten it to Don unless he was a small-town
theater snob determined to move to Hollywood to make it as an actor.
This thought forms in my mind, with all its incipient hostility, before
I can stop it. And this is probably because as soon as he’s finished
introducing himself to me, Donald’s arm is on the back of Sage’s chair
and they’re engaged in deep conversation.

I try to see my judgment for what it is—jealousy, insecurity, envy—and
let it go. Sage has seen at least twenty different women with their
tongues in my mouth since we started dating, so the least I can do is
let her enjoy Donald’s very sincere attention.

“So what made you decide to be in an open relationship?” I ask Lawrence
and Leah, hoping to get some tips and stay distracted.

“I’d been in a monogamous marriage before and it didn’t really work for
me,” Lawrence replies. “The whole time we were together, I was faithful.
But I felt physical pain in my body from not having all that juice and
excitement and connection in my life. When I came out of that, I decided
I wouldn’t ever do that again.”

“I remember you were really upfront from day one that you were
nonmonogamous,” Leah says. “There was no moment where I thought, Maybe I
can persuade him to be monogamous with me. You made it clear: It’s
either this or we can’t see each other. And I felt enough for you that I
decided to give it a try.”

From the corner of my eye, I see Donald’s arm. It’s no longer on the
back of Sage’s chair. It’s now resting on her shoulder.

“Do you ever feel jealous with Lawrence?” I ask Leah.

“I wouldn’t describe it as being jealous, but definitely some insecurity
and paranoia.” A waiter reaches over the table to set our food down,
scoping out Sage in the process. Maybe he’ll get her number later.
Suddenly everyone’s my rival. “But at one point something clicked inside
me, and I started seeing Lawrence as a genuine person who has my best
interests in mind and I realized that most of the insecurity came from
my own childhood fear of being abandoned.”

So maybe I’m feeling jealousy because I’m not secure in the relationship
right now. I’m worried that Sage opened it up because I wasn’t enough,
because she was bored by the things that I’ve been enjoying, or, even
worse, because she was so attracted to Donald.

It’s been a week since that decision, and neither of us has been with
anyone else. All we’ve done is discuss our values around being open. I
told her that honesty is important to me and we need to always share our
reality with each other. She told me that respect is important to her
and she needs to always be put first. So we decided to build our open
relationship on a foundation of honesty, freedom, and respect. It’s
exactly what I’ve always wanted. And what I like most about it is that,
as Pepper advised, there are no rules, just intents.

As I watch her with Donald, though, I become painfully aware of the
positive side of rules: They provide clear, fixed boundaries that keep
us feeling safe.

“Did you like the jicama-wrapped guacamole?” I ask Sage across the
table, trying to force a connection. But she doesn’t hear me. It may be
because her other two friends from acting class are engaged in a loud,
silly improv game with each other. So I repeat the question, but to no
avail. Now I feel ignored. Something I can’t control is going on with my
ego.

I try to focus on what Lawrence is saying: “If she’s out and says she’s
met a guy and wants to explore it, I say, ‘You’re an adult. You don’t
need my permission.’ The frame we have is that we’re both adults and we
trust each other’s judgment, otherwise we wouldn’t be together.”

I suppose I just need to trust Sage’s judgment. But what if she judges
him as more compatible with her than I am? Do I trust that? I guess I’d
have to.

“Okay,” I ask Lawrence, “so if I’m feeling jealousy right now, what do I
do?”

In my imagination, I never thought I’d be upset if Sage wanted to spend
the night with another guy, as long as I knew about it. But in reality,
it’s a completely different experience. And this is just a man with his
arm around her.

Suddenly, I have a little more empathy for the guy in the commune who
tried to murder me.

“If you’re feeling insecurity or jealousy, that’s for you to manage,”
Lawrence answers. “It’s not her job to manage your discomfort—unless
she’s doing something that’s disrespectful or hurtful. One tool I’ve
used is to understand that even if Leah deeply loves another person, it
can only be additive to our relationship.”

“In what way?”

“Think of it like this: You have a love muscle, and if you work it out
more, it increases your capacity to love. And you can bring that energy
and quality back to your relationship. The alternative to that would be
my marriage, where I shut down my capacity to love and feel and have sex
in order to stay monogamous.”

Maybe I just have to eliminate my scarcity mentality about love, which
is telling me right now that Sage has only so much to give and could run
out. Lawrence’s point of view makes much more sense. Perhaps on some
level, the demand for exclusive love is an immature demand, the desire
of the needy child who hungered to be the sole object of its parents’
attention, affection, and care.

“So,” I confirm with Lawrence, “if she’s happy, it’s not like she’s
going to go home and be sad because she got all the happiness out of her
system?”

“Right. After being in the same situation fifty or a hundred times,
pretty soon you won’t be so scared or overwhelmed. You’ll recognize the
sensation as something that’s going to pass. In my worst moments, I
think of tying myself to the mast so I don’t get sucked in by the sirens
of jealousy and dashed against the rocks. There’s nothing good that
comes of jealousy. If someone’s going to leave you, they’re going to do
it whether or not you’re jealous. In fact, they’re much more likely to
do it if you are jealous.”

It makes a lot of sense, so I try to lash myself to the mast and stay
focused on Lawrence and Leah. When dessert comes, however, I can’t
contain myself any longer. I look over at Sage and squeak, “How do you
like the flan?” And she completely ignores me again, like I’m invisible
or more likely not speaking loudly enough. Donald’s leaning in so close,
their faces are almost touching.

“What do you do if Leah sleeps with a guy who you think is a douchebag?”
I ask Lawrence.

“If he’s a douchebag, either there’s something else she’s getting from
him or it’s for her to figure out. I don’t have to fuck him, so it’s not
my problem.”

I imagine walking on the beach alone tomorrow morning while Sage is in
bed with Donald and two women she’s brought home for them to share. A
queasy feeling spreads through my chest, knees, fingers, toes, eyeballs.
I thought I’d learned and been through enough by this point to control
myself better. But this is actually the first time I’ve had to walk the
path of uncomfortable jealousy that Shama Helena told me about—and that
the women in the San Francisco house went through with me.

When we finally get up to leave, I dash to Sage and ask her, “Did you
have a good dinner?”

“Yeah, it was great.” She smiles.

“I just want to make sure you were comfortable with Donald.”

I’m hoping she’ll tell me that she was uncomfortable and just being
polite. But she doesn’t. “Yeah, I enjoyed talking to him. We’ve never
really had the chance to connect in class.”

“Okay, good.” Not good.

As we reach the door, she stops and stands with one knee bent forward,
which has the enticing effect of creating a nearly perfect triangle
between her legs. I walk out to see if she’ll follow me, but she
doesn’t. She just waits near the exit for Donald, posing like a
water-fountain nymph. And it hits me in the stomach like a baseball bat.
It feels like she’s choosing him over me.

I pause on the stairs between the restaurant and the valet stand to see
if she’ll stop on her way out to join me. And, as with every secret test
a person gives someone they care about, she fails it. When Sage leaves
with Donald, she walks right past me and they head to the valet
together. And I could swear a smile flickers across his face.

I broke up with Ingrid precisely because I believed so much in romantic
freedom, because I swore by the principle that one person should not own
another’s body, because I was so firmly convinced that possessiveness
was a fungus rotting relationships. So why, I wonder as Sage mercifully
enters the passenger seat of my car to return to the tree house, is it
eating me up so much inside now that I’ve finally reached the promised
land of my ideal free relationship?

45

Three days later, Sage tells me she’s flying to Mexico for a long
weekend with Donald and a friend of his with an equally unshortened
name, Jonathan.

And there’s nothing I can do to protest. I’ve already given her
permission. In a moment of fear and paranoia, I wonder if the offer was
on the table before we opened up the relationship.

But rather than dwell on doubts, I focus on the opportunity. This is my
chance to truly let go of possession and jealousy, to allow someone I’m
with to have fun even if it doesn’t include me. Once again, it’s exactly
what I asked for and already it’s not what I expected. Clearly, I was
supposed to be the one going to Mexico with two actresses.

I once dated a woman who always said she wanted to marry someone rich.
She ended up marrying a flat-broke musician. His name was Rich. The
universe listens—and it gives you not just what you want, but what you
deserve. It’s the forager’s karmic law.

“When’s the trip?” I ask Sage. We are in the kitchen, where she’s not
just cooking breakfast, she’s performing it, putting on a show whenever
she reaches for a glass in a high kitchen cabinet or cracks open an egg.
She’s wearing black-framed glasses, and a blue hoodie that’s been washed
to maximum softness and unzipped to show the handles of her collarbone.
I look at her with respect, lust, gratitude, fear. She’s gotten inside
me, to a deep place where my cultural, genetic, and developmental
programming resides, and plugged herself in.

“Tomorrow.” She quickly adds, “It’s just for three days.”

And now, I worry, she’s about to unplug herself. I feel a pang in my
heart. It’s too soon. I don’t have time to mentally prepare for this.

“Did they buy your ticket for you?” Jealousy is all over my voice like a
coat of spray paint. I need to shut up.

“Yes, but I told them I won’t sleep with them.”

The words are meant to be reassuring. They have the opposite effect.

I remind myself that this is what I wanted. And her spontaneous,
adventurous nature has always been one of my favorite things about her.
It’s part of the package of Sage.

The problem many people have is that the exact quality that originally
attracted them to their partner becomes a threat once a serious
relationship begins. After all, this quality was the open door through
which the romance started, so now they want to close the door, lock it,
and throw away the key before someone else tries to come in after them.

So rather than trying to crush Sage’s spontaneity, I need to appreciate
it. And besides, I’ve enjoyed a steady stream of new women, so why
shouldn’t she enjoy some fresh male attention? I need to be more
Lawrence about this.

I ask her for the flight and hotel information, just in case something
happens.

The airline, she informs me, is United. And the hotel is Temptation.

“Temptation? What kind of name for a hotel is that?”

“It’s an adults-only hotel,” she explains cavalierly. “They don’t allow
kids.”

I try to be compersive about it. I also make a mental note to research
the hotel online. Maybe it’s just a place for vacationers who want peace
and quiet without screaming children everywhere.

Unfortunately, the Temptation website is everything I hoped it wasn’t.
The banner on it proclaims: “Topless optional. Fun. Tempting. Sensual.”

It sounds like a permanent swinger party.

I suppose even if she were at a Chuck E. Cheese’s resort, I’d still be
wracked with anxiety.

Immediately after I drop Sage off at the airport the following morning,
something in me breaks. It is the safety harness tying her to me. I’m
shocked and disappointed by my reaction. Yet I can’t control it. I check
the time on my phone anxiously, waiting for the exact moment she’s
supposed to land in Cancún. Then, seven minutes after that time, I text
to make sure she’s okay.

Minutes crawl by with no response. Maybe her plane was delayed. Or maybe
she doesn’t have an international service plan on her phone. Or maybe
she’s just not thinking about me.

To kill time, and keep the abyss of _maybe_ from engulfing me, I stop by
the post office and pick up my mail. In the stack, there’s a letter from
my mom marked PERSONAL. Our last conversation didn’t go well: She said
she was searching the house for Viagra and Cialis because she was
convinced that my father was having an affair and there was “no way he
could do it on his own.” When I tried to end the conversation, she got
upset and hung up on me. So I can only imagine what she must have sent
in an attempt to get the last word in.

Then I return home and wait. Until, finally, two hours and twenty-three
minutes after I texted Sage, she responds: “Thanks, I got here safely
and am okay.”

At least she’s “okay.” Okay is better than murdered and stuffed into a
dumpster. It’s also better than having the best time ever. But the
message is so vague. I read it again. There’s not one word of affection
or emotion. Not even an emoticon. And nothing about the guys she’s with.
I feel so in-the-dark. So . . . disconnected.

At Lafayette Morehouse, the commune I visited to prepare for my group
relationship in the tree house, I learned two useful terms. One was the
concept of getting _strange ass_, which is when someone in a
relationship has sex with a new person; often, this can add to the
passion of the primary partnership. The other was _new relationship
energy,_ which refers to the obsession and fantasy that typically
accompany a new affair—and often feel threatening to someone’s primary
partner.

So I tell myself that she’s just going to get some strange ass, that any
new relationship energy will eventually fade, and that this will make
our connection more passionate in the long run.

It doesn’t help.

So I turn to Lawrence again and take him out to dinner, hoping to stay
preoccupied, get more support, and absorb some Lawrence-ness.

“I’ve been thinking about what’s bothering me,” I tell him. “It’s not
that I don’t trust Sage. It’s that I don’t know what Donald’s intentions
are. Did he take her there as a friend or because he wants to sleep with
her?” As I ask the question, the answer seems obvious. “I mean, what do
you do if you think the guy isn’t respecting you or he thinks he’s
stealing your girlfriend and somehow better than you?”

“If some dude thinks he got one over on me, it’s his idiocy.” He pauses,
probably trying to empathize with someone as emotionally backward as me,
then adds compassionately, “There’s definitely a transition period where
you have a lot of emotions to work through. So you may have some scary
insecurities about whether the other guy is better for her than you or
whether he’s using you to connect with her. Just know that it’s part of
the adjustment process.”

I suppose it makes sense: It takes time to get good at a new
relationship skill. And this definitely is one. It goes counter to
practically everything I’ve ever read, heard, thought about, and
observed since childhood. Men aren’t supposed to share women. They’re
supposed to fight and compete over them. Menelaus launched the Trojan
War after his wife Helen ran off with Paris; Sir Lancelot’s affair with
King Arthur’s wife led to war between the two; and in numerous tales,
from _The Odyssey_ to the Hindu epic _Ramayana,_ men participate in
contests to win marriage to a princess or queen. There can be only one
victor, not two or three. It’s a lot of programming to rewire.

But evidently not for Lawrence. “Leah’s so great that I want other
people to get the pleasure of experiencing what I get to with her,” he
explains. “And I’m so in love with her, I want her to do what makes her
happy.”

It’s a beautiful and strangely romantic sentiment. As he speaks, I
struggle to change my perspective, to find the pleasure in emotional
pain that Corey Feldman discussed, to let my love not for myself but for
Sage guide my feelings.

And that’s when I realize, I don’t actually want an open relationship. I
just want a half-open relationship. It’s completely unreasonable: I want
to be with whomever I want while my partner is stuck with me. I’m
clearly not as evolved as Lawrence, as emotionally stable as Pepper, as
approval seeking as James, or as masochistic as Corey Feldman. Maybe I’m
not looking for an alternative relationship, but just a selfish
patriarchal one that’s hard on her emotions but easy on mine.

I’ve learned nothing.

46

On her second night in Mexico, Sage calls briefly from a club to say
she’s drunk and she loves me. I absorb the world _love_ greedily, like
morphine for my pain.

“How’s it going?” I ask nervously.

More than anything, I hope Sage will say she’s having a horrible time
and can’t wait to come home. But of course she doesn’t. “I’m amazed by
how much fun I’m having,” she yells into the phone. “And the guys are
treating me like a princess. It’s basically the opposite of our
relationship. I’m the only girl, and I have two guys with me all the
time taking care of me. They gave me a nickname.” It’s hard to hear her
over the music. It sounds like her nickname is . . .

“Arch Low?” I ask.

“Marshmallow.”

I try to imagine any type of sexual connotation that may have and draw a
blank. It’s better than Arch Low, which could conceivably be a position
that involves two men.

We talk for a few more minutes, then she says she has to go. “This club
is incredible,” she shouts. “They brought me behind this screen and I
danced in front of eight hundred people. Then this dwarf started
pretending to hump me.”

“That sounds awesome.” I try to be positive. “I wish I were there.” I
don’t say the rest of the sentence: “. . . so I could chuck that dwarf
across the fucking club.”

So this is what having an open relationship is like: lying on the couch
in your underwear eating a peanut butter sandwich while your girlfriend
is at a clothing-optional resort in Mexico getting pampered by male
slaves and dry-humped by dwarfs. I’ve really been missing out.

I want to invite one of our play partners to spend the night, but that
would be the definition of addictive behavior: using sex like a
painkiller to avoid uncomfortable emotions. Besides, I’m so agitated, I
don’t think I’d be able to stay present with anyone.

I place my sandwich on the floor. I’ve lost my appetite. A pain shoots
through my chest and I twist my body in agony. It’s as if there’s an
itch in my heart that I can’t scratch. I recall the conversation we had
at Bliss, in which she said that she’d consider it “unmanly” if a guy
she was dating allowed her to sleep with other men. In giving her
freedom, have I lost her respect?

I was so sure this was the relationship my life was leading to. But
freedom doesn’t taste quite as sweet without security. Perhaps this is
the flip side of love avoidance: I have a need to feel needed, even if I
don’t actually like it.

I look at the clock. It’s only 8 P.M. I have Lorraine’s cell phone
number. I’ve never called her out of the blue for help. It seems vain to
even consider it. She deals with addicts whose lives are at stake. I’m
just an idiot who let his girlfriend go to Cancún with two studly
actors.

“How have you been treating yourself?” Lorraine asks when she answers
the phone. It’s the perfect therapist greeting: one with a message. It
is not about what’s happening or what’s new or how life’s treating me.
Those are things that can’t necessarily be controlled. All you can
control is your response to them, how you treat yourself.

“Not so well,” I tell her, then explain the situation.

She listens without judgment. When I finish, she responds, simply, “I
would recommend becoming a scientist of your own lows.”

“What do you mean?”

“If you’re in pain of the heart, enter into the pain and try to find its
source rather than letting the pain drive you, or trying to escape from
it or overcome it.”

“Okay.” The empathy in her voice and the logic of her words soothe me. I
already feel better. “I think it was just a momentary panic. Thanks.
I’ll let you go.”

“Remember that beneath the fear of enmeshment, the love avoidant is
secretly terrified of abandonment.”

That makes sense: Any mother who’s enmeshing is also, on an emotional
level, abandoning.

“Just remember,” she adds soothingly, “that the only people who can be
abandoned are children and dependent elders. If you’re an adult, then no
one can abandon you except you.”

“Thank you. I won’t bother you again.”

“I’m happy to help. I’ll be in L.A. next month. Let’s plan on another
dinner with your friend Rick.”

“I’d like that a lot. Did I thank you already?”

“Yes, you did.”

“Thank you.”

“Good night.”

I hang up, lie back on the couch, and try to dive into the feelings I’m
experiencing. They’re pretty easy to identify, because they’re all
shades of the same emotion: fear.

The first fear that comes up is that of not being enough—of thinking
that Sage is having more fun without me, that these guys are taking
better care of her, that she has more in common with them, that they
look healthier in bathing suits, that they appreciate her more, that
they’re better in bed than me. If even half of this is true, then it
makes my second fear almost a certainty: abandonment. Perhaps she’s
discovering that she’s happier without me around or, even worse, she’s
barely thinking about me and the call was just the obligation of a love
avoidant acting out of guilt. The third fear is that I’m not cut out for
nonmonogamy, and I’m a hypocrite who wants to fuck other women but not
allow my partner her own freedom.

Except I’m not a hypocrite. I actually agreed to this. It’s just much
harder than I thought it would be.

Behind all three fears is the deepest one of all: that Joan in rehab was
right, that I have an intimacy disorder and this whole quest has been a
symptom of it.

I imagine Sage returning to her hotel room drunk, lying on her stomach
in the luxurious Temptation bed while her two manservants strip off
their shirts and start massaging her. Slowly she becomes more aroused,
raising her hips into a low arch as the men position themselves on
either—

“Love and let go,” I tell myself, the phrase appearing in my mind, the
ghost of an old lesson from an old teacher. I take a few deep, calming
breaths. “Love and let go.”

Everything I’ve been complaining about as illogical in monogamous
relationships is truly not logical. I was right about that. But what I
didn’t take into consideration is that it’s emotional. My brain knows
that whatever Sage is doing won’t affect our relationship—and even if it
does, then it means it’s not the right relationship. But my heart won’t
listen. Suddenly, I understand why the women in San Francisco agreed to
a group relationship in theory, but then seemed to want me to themselves
as soon as they experienced it.

Before going to bed, I decide to open the letter my mom sent. Inside,
there’s just a single sheet of notebook paper. I recognize the
handwritten numbers on it as my own. It’s clearly a punishment I was
given as a teenager, though I have no memory of it. I just hold it in my
hands and stare at it in astonishment, wondering what kind of person
would want her son to think this about himself:

[image]

It doesn’t help much. But it explains a lot.

When I text Sage the next morning, she doesn’t respond. Later, I go to
lunch with a colleague who’s helping me with the final edit of the
Mexican drug war book, and I’m so tightly wound with stress that I’m
barely able to pay attention to what he’s saying. Instead, I just
wait—listening, straining, praying for the reassuring ping of an
incoming text from Sage.

As soon as the meal ends, I check my phone messages, just in case one
somehow snuck past me. Nothing. And it feels like a javelin hurtling
through my chest. She must really be having the time of her life. I
commit the cardinal sin of texting her again.

Finally, close to midnight Cancún time, Sage texts that she’s going to
bed soon and will call me from the airport tomorrow.

It’s a long night.

The following afternoon, she phones as promised during a layover. The
guys, for some probably shady reason, are on another flight the next
day. “I missed you,” she says right away. The consoling words achieve
their intended effect and the stress begins to drain out of me—that is,
until she speaks the next words. “And don’t worry, I didn’t have sex
with anyone or give anyone a blow job.”

Her words are too specific. I instantly assume she gave everyone hand
jobs.

“I had the best time,” she continues. “They love being subservient to
me. I think that’s their fetish. They enjoy waiting on me and being told
what to do and, like, sucking on my toes.”

I’m instantly creeped out. But what matters, I tell myself, is not how I
feel but how she feels. “Did you like it?”

“It’s fun being pampered, and I am attracted to them.”

Though the word _attracted_ makes me wince, as she keeps talking, I
actually do get a jolt of happiness for her. Her boyfriend before me was
extremely domineering and controlling, so maybe getting fussed over by
subservient men was healing for her. She’s such a people pleaser that
she deserves having people focused on pleasing her for a change.

Immediately following this thought, however, a cold front of negativity
arrives: If she likes getting pampered by douchebag Donald and his
friend at a cheesy Cancún resort, dancing while being admired by eight
hundred people and one dwarf, and getting her toes sucked by submissive
males—then maybe she isn’t the right person for me.

Compersion is a struggle. It goes against every fiber of my being. I
don’t know if my resistance to it is cultural or evolutionary or both,
but I work to overcome the emotional obstacles. I’ve done a lot of
extreme and experimental things these past few months, and surely I’d be
just as likely as her to go to a resort and enjoy getting pampered by
two doting women. At least she’s honest about it.

My ex-girlfriend Lisa once said that every woman wants the same thing in
a relationship: to be adored. So Sage had a great weekend of adoration,
and maybe this will help me remember never to take her for granted or
stop showing my appreciation of her.

But then she says, “And I never realized how much we text each other.”

“What do you mean?”

“They commented on it whenever I pulled out my phone.”

And that’s when the dam breaks, when the compersive adult becomes the
wounded child. Before I can stop myself, I punch the wall and scream. I
don’t even understand why her words hurt so much until a few seconds
afterward, when the emotion subsides and the shame kicks in. This whole
weekend, when I was suffering because she wasn’t texting, I assumed she
was just busy having fun. But that wasn’t why she didn’t text: It’s
because some guys she was with didn’t approve of it. And so the story I
hear is that their feelings mattered more than mine, that not being
judged by them was more important than reaching out to connect with me.
And it pisses me off.

“Are you okay?” she asks.

“Yeah. You could always have snuck away to text me, you know.”

“I know, but I was having such a nice time and in this fantasy bubble.
And I was worried that talking to you would somehow ruin it or change
things.”

Another hammer blow. So she _purposely_ disconnected. How can I still
feel compersion when I’m now the enemy of her fun? I am the bubble
burster.

What I want to say in response is, “If calling me is that much of a
downer, then let’s just stop seeing each other.” But what I say instead
is, “I’m glad you had fun. But we need to be better about communication.
Other guys shouldn’t be telling you what’s right or wrong about our
relationship, and I can’t understand why you’d even listen to them.”

There is silence on the phone, followed by a guttural staccato sound and
rapid aspirating. Shit, she’s sobbing. She had a great time in Cancún,
and now I’m making her cry. I’m doing exactly what she was worried I’d
do: pop the bubble. No wonder she didn’t call me. And no wonder I’m
having a shame attack.

Guilt is about not being good _to_ someone. Shame is about not being
good _for_ her.

“Why can’t you understand?” she finally pleads. “I needed to do this for
me.”

“I _can_ understand,” I respond, “_if_ you communicate.”

As the words come out of my mouth, I realize I’m repeating the criticism
that made her cry. Communication was something I needed, not her. She
needed freedom. I’m sure Leah doesn’t text Lawrence every few minutes
when she’s over at some guy’s house: “I just unzipped his pants, lol,”
“I’m licking his ass, it tastes like kombucha,” “Now I’m fucking him,
miss you!”

Sage is absolutely right: I would’ve burst the bubble. If we spoke, I
would’ve felt a need to give my opinion on everything, to make fun of
the guys, to somehow control the experience or make sure she was
thinking of me in some way—like Tommy with his running commentary when I
had sex with his fiancée. No, I don’t use rules to control people
anymore. Now I just pretend to give them freedom, then use guilt and
passive-aggressiveness to control them instead.

For a guy who doesn’t want to be controlled, I never noticed how
controlling I actually am. I’m acting just like my long-suffering mom.
It’s a depressing insight. Rick would probably love to hear it.

Healthy nonmonogamous relationships clearly require a high EQ—emotional
intelligence—not to mention some seriously secure attachment. And
unfortunately, I’m still not there. But it doesn’t mean I can’t
successfully make the transition from half-open to open—from selfishness
to selflessness—with more conscious practice. This is just the burning
period. No one said it would be easy.

If I truly want to be compersive with Sage and not a total hypocrite, I
need to take Lawrence’s advice to heart and understand she’s a grown
woman who can take care of herself. But, I think immediately afterward,
do I actually trust her to take care of herself? Can I even be trusted
to take care of myself?

“Is there anything else you want to share?” I ask when the boarding
announcement for her flight finishes blaring in the background.

“Mm-hmm,” she begins in a timid voice. “Did you miss me?”

“Yes,” I tell her. “I did.”

Before picking Sage up at the airport, I meet Adam near his office to
swim laps together. I fill him in on the ups and downs of the
relationship with Sage.

“At least it’s an honest relationship,” he tells me. “And that’s a good
thing. But my question for you is: Is it real?”

It’s a good question. One I’ve been avoiding.

“I honestly can’t tell you if it will work in the long run. But it’s the
most real relationship I’ve had since Ingrid. And it’s everything I said
I wanted in rehab. But it’s driving me crazy.”

As we change in the locker room, I ask Adam if he’s ever tempted to
reach out to the woman he had an affair with.

“I’ll tell you, Neil, I think about her every day. And I can’t say that
I wish it never happened, because it was the happiest part of my life.
That’s unfortunate. And on some level, my wife knows that.”

Adam, and most people, seem to believe that if a relationship doesn’t
last until death, it’s a failure. But the only relationship that’s truly
a failure is one that lasts longer than it should. The success of a
relationship should be measured by its depth, not by its length.

We shower, then head to the pool. As we do, we pass a tall, toned woman
in a one-piece bathing suit. “I’ll tell you, if she threw herself at me,
it would be hard to resist,” he comments. “When you’re not happy in your
marriage, you’re vulnerable. So I just stay busy with work and she stays
busy with the kids.”

He tells me about a book he recently read called _His Needs, Her Needs_
by Willard F. Harley, a clinical psychologist who writes that a man
needs five basic things from his wife: sexual fulfillment, recreational
companionship, physical attractiveness, domestic support, and
admiration.

“I don’t think she’s meeting a single one of those,” Adam says.

“What does he say a woman’s needs are?”

Adam explains that a woman’s five basic needs are affection,
conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and family
commitment. It seems antiquated to write that a woman needs her man’s
money but not his sex and he needs her domestic support but not her
conversation; however, this seems to resonate with Adam. I get the
feeling sometimes that he wasn’t looking to be swept off his feet in his
relationship, but to have the floor under his feet swept.

“I gave my wife the book and pointed out three pages that explain why I
had my affair, just so she could understand the things we’re missing
from our marriage,” he laments. “But she hasn’t taken the time to read
them.”

As we ease ourselves into adjacent lanes, Adam tells me that he’s had
insomnia lately and an itchy red rash on his right hand. “The
dermatologist said she can give me all the medicine there is for it, but
it’s stress related and won’t go away until the stress clears up.”

And that’s when I realize: He’s not a sex addict. “You know how they
taught us that addiction is something that hurts your life and spirit,
that gets progressively worse, and that you can’t stop doing even though
you know it’s not good for you?”

“Yeah,” he says.

“I just realized that you’re a marriage addict.”

“I think I am. I just can’t let it go for some reason.”

“Maybe you need to go to rehab for that.”

“Along with a lot of other married people,” he replies and swims off
ahead of me.

On the way to pick up Sage, I call a few of the other guys from rehab,
and only Charles is in good spirits after having evidently cured himself
of sex addiction by ending his marriage.

“I stopped going to meetings,” he says in what, for him, is an upbeat
voice. “And I’ve been so happy, I’m like a little kid. I walk with my
head up. I look at people. It’s like someone turned the lights on and I
don’t have this confined, sad feeling that I can’t go out and do
anything ever again.” He pauses and then confides, “And I finally
finished _The Game_.”

“You approve of it?”

“No, but I used it to meet a woman at the car wash the other day. We’re
going on a date tomorrow.”

They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but according to
science, even more powerful than the large space between you and the one
you love is the small space between that person and someone else. In
studies on sperm competition, males ejaculated more and harder after
their partner had been with a rival. In her book _Mating in Captivity,_
psychologist Esther Perel advises that the way to keep romance and sex
hot in a relationship is through separation, unpredictability, and fear
of loss.

So, theoretically, Sage’s return should be the ultimate in hardwired
passion and makeup sex.

Unfortunately, that’s not how it initially goes down.

When Sage emerges from customs, she’s talking to a man with a deep tan
and a gaunt, weathered face. The passionate reunion I’ve been craving
doesn’t occur because he stands next to us, watching awkwardly.

“This is Mike,” Sage says after tepidly hugging me. “We met on the
plane. He’s a director.”

I try to take the high road. It’s not easy because I desperately need
the reassurance that even if Mexico wasn’t strange ass, it was strange
feet and it didn’t hurt us. But now there’s a random leather-faced guy
lurking over us like a bodyguard. “Great,” I tell him. “Sage acts. Did
you guys exchange numbers?”

“Yes, we did,” he says.

“Well, pleasure meeting you.”

As we walk to the parking garage, Sage explains, “He offered to get me a
job on one of his films.”

“That would be great. Let’s see if he comes through on that.” Then, a
final twist of the knife: “Guys will say anything to get what they
want.”

Her face darkens. “Maybe he saw something in me that was special.” She
lingers on the last word and stares at me, as if accusing me of seeing
her only as an object of desire and not of talent.

And she’s right. I wasn’t speaking in a spirit of openness. I was
speaking to close things, to create doubt, to expose him as a potential
fraud, to poison her mind against a possible rival.

If I want this openness to work, I need to be more neutral about other
men. I’d resent her talking shit about some woman I met. Like Lawrence
said, she can discover the truth on her own. I don’t have to sleep with
him. These underhanded attempts at control stop today.

Relationships are like divining rods for locating one’s faults and
weaknesses.

As we drive home in awkward silence, I worry about how many of these
guys are going to be in our lives now—phony actors and creepy directors
and dirtbag producers who leech onto every fresh female who comes to
Hollywood with a dream. A friend once met with a top Hollywood producer
who told her he could “fast-track” her career. He explained that it just
involved spending a little extra time with him at night, and then with
some of his “influential” friends.

When we get back to the house, I kiss Sage and she kisses me back. I
lead her to the bed and she follows me. I take off her clothes and she
lets me. I go down on her and she spreads her legs for me. I enter her
and she makes sounds for me.

The woman who left for Mexico is not the same as the one who came back
from Mexico. She isn’t making love to me; she’s simply agreeing to sex.

However, just as I’m about to withdraw in disappointment, she gets on
top of me, closes her eyes, and rides me enthusiastically. To anyone
watching (such as Tommy), it would look like passionate lovemaking. But
I know her too well. Her eyes are shut firmly and her mind is elsewhere.
She’s fantasizing about being on top of someone else. I’m sure of it.
Maybe one of the guys from the trip or Leatherface from the plane.

So this is what it felt like all those times for Ingrid when I was
connected sexually but disconnected mentally.

“Is everything okay?” I ask as we lie together afterward, so close
together and so far away.

“I’m fine.”

“You know what fine means?”

“No.”

“Never mind.”

She was supposed to have more love to give after these experiences. Her
sexuality was supposed to be more alive, intense, and free. But instead
there’s less love, less sexuality, less Sage.

It feels like I lost her. And I don’t even know what I lost her to.

That evening, we walk down the beach to eat at Paradise Cove. The waves
gently polish the sand and the sky sparkles with stars, planes, planets.
There’s not another person in sight. Just Sage and I, and the long
shadows caught in the beams of our flashlights as we trudge in silence.

I feel like I’m leading a prisoner to the gallows, only I don’t know
what crime’s been committed or which of us is guilty.

One of the side effects of rehab is that I’ve become as unhealthily
obsessed with people’s childhoods as I am with their relationship
species. So, as Lorraine taught us, I look into Sage’s relationship with
her opposite-sex parent for clues to our relationship. And the pattern
is clear: When she conformed to her father’s unreasonable expectations
of her, she was daddy’s little girl—until she asserted her independence
and he lost his temper with her, often violently. After he threatened to
kill her when she was a teenager, she even spoke to a hit man about
getting rid of him once and for all. So it makes sense that she molds
herself into the perfect girlfriend and takes care of my needs, but then
begins to lose herself, grows resentful, and rebels.

If this is true, then opening the relationship wasn’t about freedom, it
was about escape. And that’s exactly what she appears to have done. So
I’m not actually leading a prisoner to the gallows. I’m leading an
escaped convict back to prison.

Hopefully Leatherface isn’t a hit man she hired to kill me.

Every now and then, the sound of her phone breaks the stillness and she
types a response. Until, finally, I can’t take it anymore. “Can I ask
you something?”

“Sure.”

I don’t know how to frame the question without sounding jealous. It may
be impossible. So, with full awareness that I sound like every woman
I’ve tried to run away from, I continue: “Is there something going on
with that guy from the plane?”

“What do you mean?”

“I don’t know—like, did anything happen with him or did you guys do
something?” I struggle to soften the harshness of what I’m thinking.

“No, nothing. We just talked.”

“Is he someone you’re interested in dating?” I hate myself for asking
these questions. I’m not sure whether I’m trying to find the wall she’s
built between us so I can tear it down or so I can use it as an excuse
to retreat. Quite possibly it’s both. This is the dance of two love
avoidants: Let me tear your wall down so I can build my own in its
place.

“Well, I think he could be a good connection for me. And he did say he’d
get me a job, so that would be great.”

“That would be a good break,” I mumble, careful to keep my pledge and
let go of control. Meanwhile, my mind plays out every horrible scenario
imaginable. They culminate in everything from her crying to me because
he kicked her out of the car after she gave him a blow job, to me at
home alone watching the Academy Awards as she arrives on his arm in an
expensive designer dress.

Suddenly, Sage’s phone pings. She checks it instantly.

“Is that him?” I ask. I’ve lost my grip on the functional adult. I am
the wounded child, scared of losing love.

“No.”

“Who was that, then?” I hear my voice asking this and I’m powerless to
stop it. People often say to trust your feelings, but emotions can be
even stupider than thoughts.

“My sister,” she says.

I don’t believe her. Both my emotions and thoughts agree on this.

And so I say something I’ve never spoken to anyone, the magic sentence
capable of destroying any relationship, the four words Ingrid spoke to
me shortly before we broke up: “Show me your phone.”

“No,” she says.

“Now I’m sure you’re lying. Just show it to me.”

She raises the phone to chest level and her fingers dance frantically
all over it.

“Don’t delete a single message or we’re through!”

I’ve made an ultimatum. I’ve hit rock bottom.

Sage wheels around and starts walking back to the house. It’s something
I would do—run away rather than face responsibility for my behavior.
It’s the first thing I did when Ingrid caught me cheating: I told her
I’d call her back later.

I run after Sage, promise not to get upset, coo everything I can to
reassure her—until finally, like a child caught hiding a cookie behind
her back, she thrusts the phone toward me.

“I’m worried you’ll hate me and never want to talk to me again,” she
says.

I brace myself for the worst.

My heart is pounding so loudly, I feel like it’s going to explode.
There’s no way for this situation to have a good outcome. If he didn’t
text, then I’m crazy. If he did, then I’m right. And whether I’m crazy
or right, something is still wrong with the relationship for us to even
be in this situation right now.

On her phone, I see dozens of texts from him, all from today. The first
one that catches my attention is worse than anything I braced myself
for: “I’ve never done anything like that on a plane before.”

Agony, revulsion, and horror rise in me like vomit. There’s another text
from him about how they have a magnetic connection that he can’t deny.

They talked for hours on the plane, she tells me. They had a powerful
chemistry, she tells me. His face was so close to hers that they just
started kissing, she tells me. It came out of nowhere, she tells me.
Next thing she knew they were in the lavatory fooling around, she tells
me. They didn’t have sex or remove any clothing, she tells me. She
stopped him out of respect for me, she tells me. And then, finally, she
tells me that she wanted to wait to discuss it with me but didn’t know
how to say it.

As the words and tears tumble from her, rough waves of emotions and
thoughts crash and collide in me. There is anger, because she lied to
me. There is jealousy, because of the chemistry she had with him. There
is disgust, because it seems so cheap. There is understanding, because
it’s pretty much what I did with Nicole and how James reacted to it.
There is even relief, because I wasn’t crazy to think there was more to
the story than she was telling. And there is fear, for so many reasons.

“I told him about you and our relationship. That’s why he wanted to meet
you in the airport,” she concludes.

But chief among these emotions, there is complete and utter
bewilderment.

“How could you? I don’t get it.”

Her lower lip starts to quiver. I’m going to make her cry again. I don’t
care. And I care.

“We’re in an open relationship,” I continue.

Silence. She fights back the tears and glares at me.

“You can do anything you want.”

Her arms fold across her chest in defiance.

“The only thing I asked for was honesty.”

Her forehead creases into lines of hatred.

“You lied to me and cheated on me in a fucking open relationship with no
rules.”

The tears come now, burning with resentment.

I am her father. I am the ruiner of fun. I am the enemy of freedom. I am
the bubble burster.

At least to her I am. But we have a free and open relationship. It was
completely unnecessary for her to sneak around and lie to me. That’s the
whole point of all this. If she’d just told the truth, then it would
have been my responsibility to deal with my reaction to it. But clearly,
as my experiences with Nicole and with her French friend Camille should
have warned me, an open relationship is no cure for drama and cheating.
And Sage did say she’d cheated on her last boyfriend.

As I move through all this, Sage stands stiffly, her arms still crossed
petulantly. I hug her to re-connect, but she remains stubbornly rigid. I
wonder if she feels like I did with Ingrid: enmeshed, overwhelmed,
trapped, like running into the water and drowning herself.

My first thought is that I need to let this relationship go. But it
seems hypocritical to break up with her for cheating when even Ingrid
gave me a second chance. And this is the most unrestricted and
adventurous relationship I’ve had so far. Aside from the lying, she’s
doing it better than I am. I want the freedom to go to Cancún with two
beautiful actresses who worship me. I want the freedom to fool around
with a strange woman I randomly meet on the plane. In fact, when I flew
home from rehab, that’s exactly what I was fantasizing about.

Besides, it’s not like I set up a situation in which Sage was safe to
tell me the truth. As soon as we were alone, I was snarky, judgmental,
and manipulative.

As I pull away, the violence explodes from her. She pounds my chest with
her fists and stomps in the sand, like a child. “I want to be in your
arms all the time,” she yells. “I need that more than anything. I feel
like I belong there”—she kicks an arc of sand into the air—“but I also
want to have my cake and eat it.”

I try to disentangle her words: She wants me but she doesn’t want me.
She needs the security of the relationship but she doesn’t want the
responsibility of it. She wants my commitment but she wants her freedom.

And slowly the truth dawns on me. I’ve gotten what I deserve: someone
just like me.

50

That night, Sage and I talk for hours, until it seems like we’ve broken
through our walls and can finally see who each other really is: the
strengths and weaknesses, the gifts and wounds, the hopes and fears, the
mother issues and father issues. Afterward, we have sex with a level of
connection and depth that’s equal parts intimacy and relief. I’m not
sure if it’s love—perhaps we are too wounded to even be capable of
loving each other—but it’s definitely passion. The sperm competition
theorists were right after all.

As I watch her sleep, her cheeks flushed pink with warmth, her light
dusting of freckles no longer covered by makeup, and her face bathed in
the innocence that belongs to those in slumber, an overwhelming empathy
flows through me. And I understand that I just need to embrace her as if
she were myself, to expect her to behave no differently than I do in
matters of the heart and flesh. Every restriction in my life has been an
invitation to a rebellion. It’s time to fully and finally commit to
freedom and the risks inherent in it: to giving Sage hers and to
enjoying mine.

Three days later, Sage goes on her first date: with Mike from the plane.
I try not to think of him as Leatherface anymore. That was the old,
non-compersive me. That night, I don’t ask her where she’s going or when
she’s coming home. And I don’t text her while she’s gone. Leashes are
for dogs and leather families.

In the meantime, I invite one of our play partners over for the night.
And that’s when I discover the next challenge of having an open
relationship: As Pepper predicted, I feel oddly guilty because I’ve been
so conditioned to believe that sleeping with someone else while my
girlfriend is away is wrong. Even if my girlfriend is away probably
fucking someone else.

To my surprise, Sage returns home before midnight and joins us in the
living room, telling me that her feelings for Mike are gone. When I ask
why, she says, “I think it’s because I’ve felt filled up by you since
our talk.”

According to Colin, one of the communards I studied with at Lafayette
Morehouse, “The best way to have strange ass is to be sure the primary
woman you’re with is totally gratified and you have her agreement. She
has to feel she has a surplus of you.”

In the weeks that follow, Sage and I try to adhere to this dictum. We
try to keep each other full. We try to let go of possessiveness. We try
to communicate through the inevitable discomfort, fear, and jealousy.
And we try not to date others who don’t respect our relationship or who
want to become our primary.

_Try_ is the critical word here, because managing feelings is like
taming lions. No matter how successful you think you are, they’re still
ultimately in control. During a foursome one night, Sage bites my cheek,
then disappears into the bathroom and throws a water bottle against the
wall. Another night, we visit a bondage club where some guy who looks
like Glenn Danzig spanks and punishes Sage for half an hour. I feel so
emasculated as I watch her enjoy being masterfully dominated that I pick
a fight with her for no good reason on the way home. And roughest of
all, one night Sage goes out with her ex-girlfriend Winter and doesn’t
return for two days.

There are times during the relationship when I don’t like myself. There
are times when I don’t like her. And there are times when we’re in
perfect harmony, sharing our strange-ass stories, then making love
one-on-one and finding it much more satisfying.

Through the ups and downs, adventures and misadventures, I tell myself
that this is just the burning period, that I’m managing powerful
emotions like guilt and fear much better as a result of all the failed
nonmonogamous relationships that led up to this, that comfort is just
around the corner.

And then one night, as we lie in bed together, Sage turns to me, her
eyes glistening, and says, “I want to have your child.”

Though her words are more the result of momentary passion than judicious
premeditation, I elatedly wonder if I’ve actually found it: a
relationship that fits all four criteria I laid out when I started this
journey. It’s not sexually exclusive, it’s honest (now), it’s emotional,
and it’s capable of developing into a family. Though I wonder what we’re
supposed to say when our kid walks in the room and sees a bunch of women
spread-eagled on the bed: “Son, when a man and four women love each
other very much . . .”?

A few minutes later, however, I remember the entirety of the final
condition: The relationship has to be capable of evolving into a family
_with healthy, well-adjusted children_. And not only is it still too
early in the relationship to know if it’s sustainable, but our lifestyle
is too intense and unstable for kids to be around it. And without the
partying, is this really a relationship?

When I call Rick to discuss the viability of getting more serious with
Sage, he responds cryptically, “Deepak Chopra says that if you want to
stop smoking, you have to change the way in which you smoke. In other
words, if you smoke with coffee or after sex, stop smoking with coffee
or after sex. Then, when you smoke at other times, really feel all the
sensations in your body. And you’ll see it for what it really is:
putting poison in your lungs.”

“So what’s the analogy for my situation?”

“Maybe you need to try only having sex with Sage and no one else for a
little while, and really feel what it’s like to be with her. See what
the truth of the relationship is—and if you’re real friends with her or
just sex-addict friends.”

“That’s a good idea. I’m going out of the country next week, so I’ll do
it as soon as I’m back.” It’s a bittersweet trip that I’m not completely
looking forward to: hiking Machu Picchu, which I’d originally booked
with Ingrid.

“Why wait until then?”

“Because Sage is bringing me twins as a birthday present before I
leave.”

“God help us all.”

51

Their names are Josie and Jenn. They have tiny breasts, tiny noses, and
tiny brains. We fooled around with them a few weeks earlier in the
bathroom at a hotel suite party.

When they arrive, however, a problem becomes immediately apparent: One
has a cold sore on her upper lip. And I don’t want to risk getting
herpes—even for twins.

Fortunately, her doppelgänger has clean lips.

“Let’s do something you guys have never done before,” the safer twin,
Josie, says, brightening the mood as she drops onto the couch.

I rack my brain to think of something I haven’t done before. Nothing
comes immediately to mind. Not a single sexual stone left unturned—at
least, not one that I really want to turn. It’s been almost a full year
of swing parties, harems, communes, and moresomes. On top of all that,
Sage and I have been to S&M dungeons, gang bang parties, orgasmic
meditation sessions, and bondage courses in our explorations. I even
slept with the twins’ mother one night after she emailed me out of the
blue. My penis is literally rubbed red and raw from the nonstop
activity.

Sage, too, seems to be at a loss.

Suddenly, inspiration strikes her. “I’ve never pissed on anyone before,”
she exclaims.

Josie doesn’t jump at the opportunity, but she doesn’t say no either.
However, after a few seconds, Sage realizes, “Yes, I have.”

As we rack our brains for something new to do together, Josie leaps off
the couch. Where she was sitting, there’s a small, spreading, bright-red
stain. Her period has started.

“We can always do some coke,” she offers apologetically as she makes her
way to the bathroom.

Sage accepts the invitation. I decline.

“I don’t have a septum anymore. Look!” Jenn, the twin with the cold
sore, says after removing a small baggie from her purse. She pushes on
the bridge of her nose and it squishes flat against her face. “Like
Michael Jackson,” she laughs. “Except mine’s from doing too much coke.”

“It just burned your septum away?” I ask, incredulous.

“Pretty much.”

“Can I touch it?”

“Go ahead.”

She thrusts her nose toward me proudly and I mash it like a big wobbly
button.

One of the most dangerous side effects of cocaine is that it causes
people to talk about themselves nonstop. And soon the twins are
chattering away about the celebrities they’ve slept with and the rich
men they’ve used, as Sage hangs on their every word. If the male game is
getting sex, they school her, the female game is withholding it. When
there’s something they want—such as emotional control or financial
commitment—they dangle sex just out of reach, creating a finish line
that appears to draw closer with every meeting yet always remains one
elusive step away.

As Sage nose-vacuums the last line of white dust off the coffee table,
Jenn cackles, “That’s not a line, it’s a chapter.” She turns to me. “Do
you mind if our dealer comes over with more?”

I press her nose, hoping it works like an off button.

Worst birthday ever, I think as I head downstairs to sleep alone. On the
nightstand, there’s a tube of Neosporin, which Sage recommended using to
treat my friction-sore dick. I rub it on, feeling annoyed and neglected.
This is what it’s like to date my _own_ twin: She’s so busy trying to
fill the emptiness inside her that she has no time to fill the emptiness
inside me.

To cheer myself up, I decide to gently masturbate myself to sleep. It’s
my birthday present to me.

I close my eyes, take a few breaths, relax into the pillow, find a
comfortable grip away from the tender area, and prepare to sink into
fantasy.

I try to imagine a woman I’m attracted to and haven’t slept with yet,
but no one comes to mind.

I try to think of a sexual fantasy I haven’t experienced yet, but can’t
come up with a single one.

I try to think of something that will turn me on, but I draw a complete
blank.

I have nothing to masturbate to. I didn’t even think this was possible.
For the first time in my life, my fantasy coffers are empty.

I think back to the challenge Rick originally posed almost two years
ago: Am I any happier?

I’ve had a lot of excitement, even a lot of pleasure. But I don’t think
I’ve truly had any happiness.

Researchers at Princeton University did a study on the correlation
between money and happiness. As people’s incomes rose up to $75,000
annually, their happiness increased. But at incomes beyond that, people
on average did not become happier.

Perhaps the same is true of sexual partners.

Coming on more tits is not going to make me any happier.

It seems I’ve mistaken being out of control for freedom.

When I asked Lorraine how I’d know if this journey was true to my
authentic self, she warned: Wounds bring drama and trauma, not comfort.

It doesn’t take long to determine what the past year has brought.

“There is nothing frenzied about debauchery, contrary to what is
thought,” Albert Camus once wrote. “It is but a long sleep.”

It is time to wake up.

“The obvious clinical facts demonstrate that men—and women—who devote
their lives to unrestricted sexual satisfaction do not attain happiness,
and very often suffer from severe neurotic conflicts or symptoms. The
complete satisfaction of all instinctual needs is not only not a basis
for happiness, it does not even guarantee sanity.”

—Erich Fromm, _The Art of Loving_

A foreign correspondent I met in Haiti while working at _The New York
Times_ once told me a story about a colleague of his, which has always
stuck with me, although I was never able to independently corroborate
it:

When he was on assignment in Central America, he was kidnapped by
rebels. Government troops discovered their location and planned a rescue
operation. Rather than give up the hostages, the rebels decided to kill
them.

So one of the gunmen pushed the reporter to his knees and pressed a
pistol against his head.

In that moment of finality, the reporter thought not of his wife at
home, but of his high school sweetheart. A woman he hadn’t spoken to and
had barely even thought of in over ten years.

Suddenly, an explosion shook the shack. Moments later, government forces
burst in and rescued him.

Afterward, the reporter reflected on that unexpected moment of truth. He
had been given a second chance at life, and there was no doubt what he
needed to do. As soon as he got home, he called his high school
sweetheart. She told him that she was divorced. So the reporter left his
wife and married her.

As I hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu without Ingrid, I can’t stop
thinking about that reporter’s story. It may not be a fairy-tale happy
ending, but it’s a real-life happy ending. Life is a test and you pass
if you can be true to yourself. To get the first question correct, all
you have to know is who you are. A life is just one letter away from a
lie.

I originally invited Adam to join me, but his wife said that if he was
going to take a vacation, it should be with the whole family. Then I
tried Calvin, who said yes, and made plans to go to Brazil afterward to
see his son. Sage also wanted to come, but the trail permits were
already sold out.

“I have a favor to ask,” Calvin begged just before the trip. “Make sure
I don’t go mongering in Peru.”

“I promise,” I told him. Then I searched _mongering_ online until I
found his particular definition of the word: whoring, especially in a
foreign country.

For the first couple of days, the walk is uncomfortable. Not just
because of the length of the trek and the steepness of the ascents, but
because I had sex with Sage before I left, and the skin on the shaft is
blisteringly red from overuse and stings from the slightest touch.
Whenever I change clothes, I have to cradle it gently, like a broken
bone. There’s Neosporin in my first-aid kit, so every few hours when I
take a break to pee in the underbrush, I surreptitiously rub some on.

Calvin and I are accompanied by a mandatory guide, Ernesto, a squat
Andean man with legs sculpted from a lifetime of hiking these mountains.
As we tramp mostly uphill, through arrows of rain and blankets of heat,
chewing coca leaves to ameliorate altitude sickness, our minds clear and
we share our dreams, fears, and ambitions.

There is, however, a space between us where something is missing. It is
just big enough to fit Ingrid. And with every peak that juts through the
clouds, every ruin that emerges in the clearing, every smell that
perfumes the morning dew, I wish she were there to share it.

I don’t think about Sage being here and seducing random female hikers
into camping threesomes. I can just imagine her asking the guide how to
turn coca leaves into cocaine. To my surprise, since snapping out of my
decadence-induced stupor on my birthday night, I’m not even worried
about what she’s doing at home and who she’s doing it with.

“So how’ve you been doing with the mongering?” I ask Calvin as we reach
a small plateau.

“It’s been a while. I haven’t seen an escort in probably six months.”

“Maybe that’s because you were living with one.”

“I think that’s what ruined it for me. For my birthday, Mariana dressed
up like the day we met and thought it would turn me on, but it repulsed
me. I didn’t want anything to do with it.” He stuffs a handful of coca
leaves into his mouth and continues. “The odd thing is that since I
stopped, I’ve been drinking a bit—and getting angry at people who don’t
follow the rules, like if they don’t use their turn signals to change
lanes.”

We walk in silence for a while as the forest screams with life around
us, both probably thinking about how his behavior supports the addiction
theories he supposedly disproved.

“I have a weird dream last night,” Ernesto says softly.

“What was it?”

“I should not say it maybe.”

To make him more comfortable, I share one of mine. “I’ve been having
this recurring dream lately where I’m playing soccer. And I’m
visualizing the penalty kick that’s going to score the winning goal. But
when the time comes for the actual kick, I barely connect with the ball
and it dribbles just a few feet in front of me. And every time, I’m
jolted awake by my feet kicking the sheets.”

“Bad dream,” Ernesto replies. “Your mind, it knows the right thing to
do; but your body, it doesn’t listen. Maybe I tell you mine.” He lowers
his voice, even though there’s no one around us. “So . . . I dream that
a girl from the Amazon is in Cusco to look for me, and I am very worried
that my wife finds out she is there.”

“Were you worried because you’d slept with her?”

“An affair, yes.”

“Is this girl someone you’re seeing in real life?”

He hesitates, then responds tersely, “Yes.”

We discuss his affair and all the others his friends have when they
leave their homes to work as guides and porters. “There’s a book I
want,” he says. “It is about strategies for these women. Very helpful.”

“Is it _The Game_?” Calvin asks.

“No.” We pause to lean against a large outcropping of boulders, drink
water, and wipe sweat while he searches his memory for the book’s name.
Then suddenly, it comes back to him. “I think it’s called _How to
Cheat_.”

Men everywhere, it seems, are the same.

As the hours pass, my lifelong antipathy to jogging and unnecessary
walking catches up with me, and I tire and fall behind the guys, sweat
prickling my sun-roasted neck. Calvin and Ernesto clear a ridge and when
I reach it ten minutes later, I don’t see them.

I trudge on, but soon my head starts to spin. I feel incorporeal, like
at the beginning of my ecstasy trip, but with the addition of a
headache. Maybe it’s dehydration or altitude sickness or exhaustion, or
all three. I pull the water bottle from my bag and drain the small
puddle that remains. I slow to a zigzag trudge, worried that I’m going
to veer off the ledge and tumble into the valley far below.

And I wonder: If I collapsed right now and I needed someone to get help
before dehydration or heatstroke or pulmonary edema killed me, which of
my current or former girlfriends could I rely on?

My ex-girlfriend Katie would probably get angry at me for abandoning her
by collapsing. My ex Kathy would start hyperventilating, and I’d end up
having to rescue her. And Sage . . . I imagine that she’d stay by my
side. But for how long until she got restless, began worrying about what
she was missing by being there, and took off to save herself?

Only Ingrid would stay with me, trying to find help until my dying
breath.

Ingrid.

In that moment, the dizziness briefly lifts. And with my lungs full of
crisp smog-free air, with my vision clear and unobstructed by
advertising, with my ears open and unclogged by chatter, with my mind
clear and unclouded by distractions, a thought I’ve been trying to keep
buried charges to the surface of my mind on a tidal wave of emotion: _I
blew it._

Sex is easy to find—whether through game, money, chance, social proof,
or charm. So are affairs, orgies, adventures, and three-month
relationships—if you know where to look and are willing to go there. But
love is rare.

I was so blind. I really thought that when I broke up with Ingrid, it
was about wanting freedom. I didn’t see at all, despite everything I’d
learned, that it was about not wanting to be loved so much. I did
exactly what Lorraine warned me not to: I let the grounded adolescent
run my life.

Whatever I have with Sage, it is not love. She molds herself into the
perfect partner for me because she wants something back—affection,
attention, and whatever little social status comes from being a writer’s
girlfriend. And I mold myself into the perfect boyfriend because I want
the sexual adventures. Maybe the reason I didn’t take Rick’s Deepak
Chopra advice is because if I did, then I’d see the relationship for
what it is: not poison like smoking, but immature like breaking up with
your wife and buying a sports car after finding your first gray hair.

Except if married men have mid-life crises, men who haven’t ever truly
been able to commit have no-life crises. And if they’re able to see
clearly for even just a moment, they start to realize that they’re
losing more than they’re gaining each day they remain stalled on the
scenic road of growing up.

When I finally huff up to the mountain pass, I see two figures sitting
just on the other side of it: Calvin and Ernesto. I drop my backpack to
the ground, collapse in the shade, and swallow Ernesto’s water and
Calvin’s aspirin. Then I wait for my body to return to equilibrium.

Though it was more a brush with discomfort and anxiety than with death,
there’s one thing I didn’t think about in that moment of truth: the wild
foursome with Sage, Leah, and Winter. No, I thought about Ingrid.

I thought about returning the sports car, going home, and begging for
forgiveness.

At the campsite on our final night, as Ernesto, Calvin, and I drink tea
and snack on Andean guinea pig under the swaying glow of a lantern, I
pull out a deck of Skittykitts and suggest a game, hoping it will
distract me from my thoughts.

“I wish Ingrid were here,” I sigh to Calvin. “She’d love playing
Skittykitts with us right now.”

Calvin mumbles something noncommittal. He’s probably sick of me whining
about her.

“And she’s so funny. By now, we’d have dozens of private jokes. You saw
how she lit up the table when she came to rehab! I hope I haven’t blown
it.”

“You’ll get back together with her,” Calvin says matter-of-factly. “I
know it.”

“I hope so.” I close my eyes and a deep sense of despair overwhelms me.
What’s the fun of hiking Machu Picchu, of walking a trail carved
centuries ago, of waking to see the sun cresting over a mountaintop and
the clouds below, of eating Andean cuisine and playing Skittykitts in a
tent underneath the glow of a lantern, if I can’t share it with someone
I love?

That is the price of freedom.

As we begin our descent to the lost city of Machu Picchu the following
morning, the reception indicator on my phone returns to life with a
single bar.

And I text Ingrid: “Freeeeeeeedom!”

54

After I send the text, followed by another letting her know Machu Picchu
has no magic without her, a surge of familiar fear comes over me. That
night, I dream of having a threesome with two random tourists.

Why won’t my libido leave me alone?

Before checking my phone for Ingrid’s response, I try to steady my
nerves. So many people much wiser than myself—Prince Charles, Bill
Clinton, General Petraeus—have cheated on their wives. Can I really hope
to succeed where the world’s leaders have failed?

I don’t know. But what I can do that they didn’t is make the choice to
be honest, to communicate my vulnerabilities with Ingrid, and to get
support if I’m struggling. Fuck my doubting mind. I can do this.

I check my phone. Nothing. But I know in my heart that she’ll keep her
word from what seems like so long ago.

When we reach the fabled city, nestled among the mountaintops, there’s
still no response from Ingrid. Nor is there one when the sun sets. Maybe
she didn’t get it. Maybe I misspelled _freedom_ and didn’t use the right
number of e’s. Maybe she’s happy with her new boyfriend. Maybe she’s
forgotten about me. Maybe I made a mistake.

Definitely I made a mistake.

55

The next day, there’s still no response from Ingrid.

56

The following day, nothing.

57

The day after that, I realize she’s never going to respond.

That night in the Spaceship Room, I told Ingrid I needed time to explore
and learn and make a choice—and finally I’ve made it. But love is not
like roulette. You can’t bet on a spread.

As I’m packing to return home on my last night in Peru, I receive a
message not from Ingrid, but from my ex-girlfriend Kathy, who says she
urgently needs advice. Like Ingrid, Kathy was abandoned by her father,
who was caught living in secret with another woman and other children.

When I call, Kathy explains tearfully that her ex-boyfriend Victor was
recently diagnosed with liver cancer. He’s a notorious player from Miami
who broke up with her because he wanted to fuck other women. But while
he was delirious on medication in the hospital, his family said he kept
calling out her name. When Victor regained his senses, the doctor told
him the cancer had advanced so much that, at age forty-four, he had only
three months left to live.

Victor didn’t react to the news by deciding to go on a fucking spree for
his last days on earth. He didn’t get a bunch of women together so he
could experience the wildest foursome ever. Instead, he told his family,
“That’s what I get for being a player all my life. I need Kathy. I need
to apologize to her.”

“So he called me last night and asked me to go to the Caribbean with
him,” Kathy continues. “He said he wants to spend the days he has left
with me.”

“What’d you tell him?”

“I told him I needed time to decide. He threw my love away when he
wanted to have fun and now that he’s dying, he wants me back? I’m scared
it’s going to be too painful to get close to him again and then lose him
again.”

“You’re right. It would be good for him to have you there, but it
wouldn’t be healthy for you.”

And that’s when I understand why Ingrid hasn’t called back.

It’s predictable, even stereotypical, that a love avoidant like me would
hit a bottom and reach out to the love addict, only to start the cycle
anew and waste another year of our lives. Or that a love avoidant, as
soon as his next girlfriend says she wants to have a family together,
would start pining for the one who got away.

As for my big Machu Picchu epiphany, while the longing for Ingrid may
have been real, everything else about it was pitiful. Love isn’t about
wanting someone to save my life or see a vista with me or make me laugh
or any of those selfish reasons I’ve always given for loving Ingrid.
Those are just things she can do for me or ways she makes me feel. Love
is . . .

Actually, I have no idea what love is.

Ingrid’s right. She’s doing what’s healthy; I’m not.

All I’ve got is a healed dick and a defective heart.

58

When I return home, I receive a wedding invitation in the mail. I check
the calligraphy on the back of the envelope. It says _De La O._ Ingrid’s
last name.

My muscles go weak and I drop the card to the ground.

I am a dumb jerk.

*n(n-1)/2, with “n” being the number of lovers in a poly pod.

_“Y_ou set out to do something and you did it. You accomplished
everything you ever wanted. You had every single kind of sexual
adventure and relationship you ever dreamed of. And you’re still not
happy or fulfilled.”

The voice is wise. The voice is cruel. The voice is right. It belongs to
Rick, who sits at the Italian restaurant Giorgio Baldi in his uniform of
white T-shirt, black shorts, and frayed loafers.

“That’s because he hasn’t been in any relationships with real intimacy.
He’s one up and they’ve been way one down. They’re toys. He won’t get
hurt playing with a toy. But these women, they will.”

This voice is also wise. It is also cruel and right. It belongs to
Lorraine, who’s in town running a workshop. I notice for the first time
how heavily creased the lines around her lips are, as if strained from
dispensing so much wisdom.

I struggle to take it in. The hardest truth to swallow is the one that
follows a full meal that one thought was truth but turned out to be the
opposite.

“Can’t you see?” Rick turns to address me directly. “All your
relationships were doomed to fail! It didn’t matter what kind you tried,
whether it was with one person or a hundred.” His eyes blaze with the
fire of conviction he gets when channeling the gods of harsh truth.
“Because it’s not relationships that are broken. It’s you!”

And that’s when it sinks in: The battle is lost. I feel a wrecking ball
swing through my head, smashing all the open relationships, the swinger
orgies, the free-love communes, and the threesome adventures. If Rick
had told me this any earlier, I wouldn’t have been able to hear him. I
would have argued, resisted, and tried to prove him wrong. But for the
first time, I have no _what-if_ arguments and scenarios left to debate
him with.

All that remains is me, sitting with my family of choice, my heart in
pieces over losing Ingrid and my mind flagellating itself for every bad
decision since leaving rehab.

As for Sage, I returned from Machu Picchu, ready to break things off . .
. and she was already gone. She sent a long email explaining
apologetically that she felt she was losing her identity in our
relationship and needed to find herself. So she decided to move back to
Brooklyn with her ex-girlfriend Winter, who she’s now apparently dating
again.

Even though I was about to do almost the exact same thing to Sage, it
came so unexpectedly and on the heels of losing Ingrid, that I was
emotionally wrecked. I suppose when a bandage covering an open wound is
peeled off, it’s going to bleed a little.

“So what should I do?” I ask Rick and Lorraine. All evening, they’ve
been destroying what remains of my ego, exposing my every thought as a
fraud and my every emotion as infantile. Almost two years have passed
since I went to rehab. I tried sex addiction recovery and it didn’t work
for me. I tried monogamy and it didn’t work for me. I tried nonmonogamy
and it didn’t work for me. So what’s left?

“You need to try the only thing you haven’t experienced yet,” Lorraine
suggests.

“What’s that?”

“Anhedonia.”

I repeat the word clumsily. I’ve read many big books with big words, but
I’ve never come across _anhedonia_ before. Whatever it is, I don’t like
the sound of it.

“It’s the dark place of not feeling,” she elaborates. “People feel dead
in the place of anhedonia. They can’t experience joy.”

I think back to Henry’s ninth emotion. That’s what it’s called—not the
death emotion, but anhedonia. “Why would I want to experience that?”

“Because in order to return to homeostasis and have any clarity on who
you are and what you need, you have to detox from the intensity of these
one-up, one-down relationships. You’ve been through a constant cycle of
intensity, from your relationship with your mother all the way up to
your relationship with Sage.” She pauses to order a glass of wine, and
for some reason I’m surprised, as if drinking is taboo for addiction
therapists. “You’ll find that being committed to your authentic life
supersedes the intensity.”

I sit in silence, processing this. In my heart, I know she’s right. I
spent all year thinking that if somehow I found the right relationship,
my problems would magically disappear. But the one relationship I didn’t
try was the one with myself. For a love avoidant, I’ve done a good job
of constantly having some sort of girlfriend for the last eight years.
Maybe that’s because there’s no better place to hide from intimacy than
in a relationship.

When I last sat with Rick and Lorraine, it felt like every door in the
world was opening to me. Now they’re all shut, locked, and sealed with
concrete—including, most painfully of all, the only one I want to walk
through, the one leading back to where I started.

“But what should I do about Ingrid’s wedding?”

“Don’t worry about Ingrid for now,” Lorraine says as the wine arrives,
her words searing my addled heart. “Just let yourself be emptied out and
deal with whatever comes up in the process. I’ll help you. Then we can
fill you up with the things you need—and you can see how you really feel
about Ingrid then.”

People do lemon juice and cayenne pepper diets to clean out their
insides, so why not a cleanse for the psyche? Then I can start consuming
healthy thoughts and experiences. That is, as long as Lorraine isn’t
going to fill me with the sexual shame Joan was peddling. I know I can’t
heal myself alone—I barely even trust myself anymore—but I can’t help
feeling that rehab was as harmful as it was helpful.

“What kinds of things do you want to fill me up with?” I ask, to be
certain.

“With freedom.”

That’s the last word I expected to hear her say. “What do you mean?”

Lorraine places her glass on the table, takes my hand in hers, and looks
into my eyes. She then replies slowly, making sure each word lands
meaningfully, “In life, we are born innocent and pure, beautiful and
honest, and in a state of oneness with each moment. As we develop,
however, our caregivers and others load us with baggage. Some of us keep
accumulating more and more baggage until we become burdened by all the
weight, trapped in beliefs and behaviors that keep us stuck. But the
true purpose of life is to divest yourself of that baggage and become
light and pure again. You’ve been searching for freedom this whole time.
That is true freedom.”

I thought I’d at least healed something during rehab and my year of sex
addiction therapy, but clearly all I did was identify my issues and then
go consciously live an unconscious life. It takes more than advice,
books, meetings, therapy, and rehab to change. It takes more than even a
powerful, unwavering, full-bodied desire to do so. It takes humility.
And there is nothing more humbling than the past year, and the
realization that I’ve made a mess of everything and may never experience
true happiness, love, and family if I keep trying to do things my way.

The underlying cause of most unfulfilled lives is that we are simply too
close to ourselves to see clearly enough to get out of our own way.

“Why don’t you come back to the hospital and continue working on
yourself?” Lorraine offers.

My enthusiasm instantly fades as I imagine going back to rehab with
Joan. I’d rather move back in with Belle, Anne, and Veronika.

Lorraine reads my mind. “But privately, just with me.”

“Really, you’d do that?”

“It may be your last chance.” She tilts her wineglass to her wise lips
and lets the last drops fall into her throat. “I’ll be working with your
friend Adam in a few weeks. If you’d like to, you can join us. But be
vigilant: You’re at great risk right now of jumping into another
relationship. And if you can’t refrain from relationships and sexual
contact throughout this entire process, then I’m going to recommend you
check back into rehab.”

A triumphant smile flashes across Rick’s face. And the adapted
adolescent in me, the grounded teenager who’s been running my life so
poorly this last year, makes a last desperate attempt to save himself:
“So basically,” he asks, “you want me to castrate myself?”

“Yes,” Rick replies coolly. “We do.”

2

In the weeks that follow, as I wind down my life and wait to get help
from Lorraine, masturbation saves me.

You want to ask out someone you recently met? Masturbate first, then see
if you still want to spend six hours wining, dining, and entertaining
her, desperate for an outcome that’s not only going to disappoint you if
it doesn’t occur, but may even disappoint you if it does.

You want to call an escort? Masturbate first, then see if you really
want some junkie who looks nothing like her decade-old Photoshopped
images to give you a lazy hand job.

You want to call a former fuck buddy? Masturbate first, then see if you
still want to invite her over, have sex that isn’t as good as you
remembered, then spend the rest of the night figuring out how to
politely get rid of her without hurting her feelings.

Masturbate when you want to break the rules of your relationship or your
celibacy agreement—and you’ll soon discover that once your desires are
fulfilled in your imagination, the need to live them out in real life
suddenly doesn’t seem so urgent. Once the brain’s reward center has
gotten its hit of dopamine, it doesn’t need another one—at least not for
a little while.

They say that viewing porn correlates with depression. I’m not sure
whether it’s a cause or a symptom, but now I understand why it’s so
appealing: It’s not just a world where sex is easy, but also where sex
doesn’t involve dealing with someone’s emotions before, during, and
after the experience.

She doesn’t yell at you if you aren’t faithful and you start watching
another porn clip. She doesn’t shame you for your taste in women, your
fetishes, your performance, or your body, income, and faults—unless
being shamed happens to turn you on, in which case she’s glad to do it
all night. And she doesn’t mind if you come before it’s done, then roll
over and go to sleep and never talk to her again. It’s just instant
sexual gratification with no waiting, no rejection, no emotion, no
commitment, no obligation whatsoever—plus infinite variety.

The strict sexaholics and sex addiction therapists definitely wouldn’t
agree with the jerk-off solution, and it’s delaying my entry into the
pleasureless world of anhedonia, but it serves its purpose as a Band-Aid
keeping me faithful to myself and my promise to Lorraine before seeing
her again.

The only problem is that after the orgasm, I’m still stuck with
myself—and my mistakes. I think about Ingrid’s footsteps clomping
outside the front door, her mocking shouts of freedom, the glee she took
in blocking my path when I tried to enter a room, and the warmth of her
body, heart, and spirit. All she tried to do was bring joy and laughter
into my life. And in return, I gave her the best of what I had to offer:
resentment.

One lonely evening, after my porn pity party, I bring a stack of
unopened mail and random bills to the bed. That’s when I come across
Ingrid’s wedding invitation again.

Perhaps it’s time to come to terms with her marriage and move on to the
last stage of grief, acceptance. I turn the envelope nervously in my
hands for a few moments, wondering if she’s marrying the James
Dean–on–steroids guy. Then I slide an index finger along the flap, my
heart thudding loudly, my body bracing for the shock.

I scan the card and see the words _Hans De La O._ She’s marrying her
brother?

No, idiot, her brother is getting married. And for some reason—maybe
accidental, maybe spiteful—you’ve been invited.

My heart bursts open and hope rushes through me, chasing away the
darkness. When Ingrid and I were dating, her shy brother told me that
he’d never had a girlfriend. Something must have changed. And now I’ve
been granted one last opportunity to see Ingrid again. This just may be
the best day of my life.

There’s only one problem: Though I’ve displayed a modicum of
self-control by avoiding sex and relationships these last few weeks, I’m
still exactly the same. If I truly want to change, not only do I need to
cut the porn out—it’s certainly not doing anything positive for my
mind—but I need Lorraine’s help. More than all the sex and alternative
relationships in the world.

The next morning, Lorraine calls unexpectedly. “There’s something I want
you to do for me,” she says.

“Anything,” I respond. And I mean it.

Dr. Hasse Walum doesn’t look like the kind of scientist who churns out
eighty-page research papers that are barely decipherable to anyone
without a Ph.D. in biology. He has long, stringy Kurt Cobain hair, a
boyish face sculpted like Ryan Gosling’s, and the relaxed poise of a
young Marlon Brando.

Over dinner, I ply him with cocktails until, finally, I ask what I’m
there to find out. When she called, Lorraine suggested that, since I
liked talking to experts so much, I should see Walum. “He’s a famous
geneticist,” she explained. “And I want you to ask him a question.”

Not surprisingly, considering her perceptiveness, it was a question
that’s been playing on a loop in my head for the last two years. One
which, even now as I’m praying for a miracle when I see Ingrid again at
her brother’s wedding, has been lurking in the shadows of my mind: Is
being monogamous something that’s genetically determined or do I have a
choice in the matter?

When I asked for Walum’s contact information, Lorraine replied, “Oh, I
don’t know him. I’ve just read about him.”

As I researched Walum, I wondered what Lorraine was up to. Everything he
stands for seems to contradict what she’s been telling me. His
experiments, along with similar research conducted by his colleagues at
Emory University, have led to the discovery of the exact biological
factor responsible for monogamy. Evidently, if you have long receptors
in the brain’s reward center for the hormone vasopressin, then you’re
more likely to be monogamous. If not, then you’re a born player.

One science writer, summarizing these findings, concluded: “Devoted
fathers and faithful partners are born, not made or shaped by a father’s
example.”

If this is true, then there’s no point in seeing Lorraine again or even
going to Hans’s wedding. I’m as nonmonogamous as I am male, and stuck
with my own species whether I like it or not. I wonder if this is a ruse
of Lorraine’s to test my sincerity and see if I’m willing to change on
the basis of faith alone in defiance of proof, evolution, genetics, and
experience.

After a few drinks with Walum, I pop Lorraine’s question: “Do you think
monogamy is genetically determined?”

The answer seems obvious, considering what I know already about Walum.
But his response surprises me. “Not entirely,” he says. And I find I’m
relieved to hear those two words. “There have been studies where
scientists have taken young rodents away from their parents, and as a
result, they get a much lower amount of the receptors.”

“How about with people?”

“They’ve done similar research with humans, looking not exactly at
receptors in the brain, because that’s really difficult to do in people,
but at plasma levels of oxytocin and vasopressin. And kids in orphanages
have lower levels. So, generally, good parenting will promote better
oxytocin and vasopressin systems in the long run, and these are linked
with more closely bonding individuals when it comes to romantic
relationships. We haven’t published it yet, but that’s exactly what
we’re looking at right now.”

It makes sense: If you have a healthy bond with your parents, you’ll
have a healthy pair-bond with others as an adult—which, considering my
upbringing, doesn’t bode well. “So let me ask you: If you’re an adult
_and_ you don’t have a gene coding for long vasopressin receptors _and_
you’ve been badly parented, is there any hope?”

“I think so,” he says, and a second wave of relief rises above the
first. “A messed-up childhood makes it hard, and it gets even more
complicated as you get older, but it’s not set in stone. We haven’t
found anything that’s completely genetic. Not even these really hurtful
diseases like autism and schizophrenia, or things like intelligence.
There’s still some sort of environmental factor involved. So you get to
change things.”

It seems I am in control of my romantic destiny after all. Now I see why
Lorraine wanted me to speak to Walum: to crush my last reservoir of
resistance and skepticism—the argument that monogamy and fidelity are
evolutionarily unnatural or culturally anachronistic or just not
lifestyles I was built for. She probably doesn’t want to hear me
intellectually debating those points all through therapy again.

Walum orders another drink, then runs a hand through the thick hair that
genetics has blessed him with. “Can I ask why you’re raising these
specific questions?” he inquires.

I tell him about the last few years of cheating, rehab, failed monogamy,
failed nonmonogamy, regret, and repentance.

“That’s the sad thing for women,” he says afterward, shaking his head.
“You can’t be perfect enough for a man not to want to cheat.”

It’s a surprisingly cynical comment, one that seems to come more from
experience than from research, so I ask him: “What’s your relationship
situation?”

He heaves a sigh and confesses, “I think I experience relationships as
more difficult than other people do.”

He slumps back in the booth and I lean in, sensing that he may be going
through a crisis similar to mine. “So if you could design the perfect
relationship for yourself, considering the genetic, evolutionary, and
behavioral factors we’ve been talking about, what would it be?” I ask.

“I can’t really answer that at the moment.”

“You must have a secret plan. Everyone has one. I used to have a few
until I experienced them in real life.”

Walum thinks for a while, then gives his answer: “Being a loner. That’s
a solution.” He forces a smile.

“Considering that you’re a biologist, that wouldn’t be a good
evolutionary strategy.”

“Yeah,” he admits, “so that’s no good.” Then he sighs and says, “I don’t
really know. Actually, that’s my answer. Maybe that’s one of the reasons
I’m studying these things—to understand why I feel the way I do myself.”

Suddenly, Walum’s no longer a vaunted scientific researcher, but a guy
just like me, trying to figure out why something as simple as loving
someone is so complicated in real life.

“So is it hard for you to be faithful?” I press.

“Not exactly. I would never be unfaithful. But in relationships, I feel
limited because I’m missing out on other things. It’s a bit tragic. You
can be with someone that you really, really like and still feel a bit
sad that you can’t have anything else.”

“So you get depressed because you feel trapped?”

“More or less.”

“Can I ask you a personal question? Did you have to take care of your
mother growing up?”

“Not when I was really, really young, but later on, definitely.”

“Emotionally or physically?”

“Primarily emotionally.”

“Interesting.”

And so I end this last week exactly where Lorraine wants me. I recognize
that I can make every argument in my head against monogamy. And they may
even be right: It probably isn’t natural. But none of this is going to
make me happy or bring me closer to Ingrid—or, if she won’t have me, to
any meaningful connection.

The person who is too smart to love is truly an idiot.

With my last pillar of intellectual resistance demolished, I fly to
Lorraine to be healed, to become worthy of Ingrid, to become worthy of
myself, to find out who I am beyond the perpetually turning wheels of
desire, manipulation, and intellectualization that have run my entire
life.

“It’s time for you to get your life back,” Lorraine announces, rising in
front of us in a green-and-brown dress like Mother Earth herself. “Your
childhood is a terrorist and it’s holding you hostage.”

Adam and I sit in plastic chairs arranged side by side in an
administrative building off the site of the rehab hospital. Calvin, who
I invited with Lorraine’s permission, is also with us. Except this time,
we’re not here as sex addicts and there are no red tags hanging from our
necks. Lorraine has decided to try a new type of workshop, one that’s
not designed specifically for people with addictions but for all men and
women who, like us, spend their lives running in circles like dogs
chained to a stake in the ground. And that stake is trauma.

“All of you share something in common,” Lorraine continues. “Each of you
had a mother who was unhappy and who you could not help. And that has
been the starting point for your three very different journeys away from
intimacy and connection.”

As she speaks, all our confusions and complications suddenly seem so
clear and simple. Our lives are like children’s building-block games in
which objects are stacked one by one on top of each other. You can build
the tower to a certain height without a problem, but as it continues to
grow, eventually the instability of the foundation will cause everything
to come tumbling down.

But, I wonder, how do you fix the base when you’ve stacked so much on
top of it already? As Walum put it, the older you get, the more
complicated it becomes.

“The goal this week,” Lorraine concludes, “is to get the three of you
unstuck.”

She starts with Adam, pulling out his genogram and trauma worksheet,
which he brought for her to reexamine. “Are you happy in your marriage?”
she asks him.

“No, I’m really not. What I had with this other woman showed me the
happiness I was missing.”

“Is your wife happy in the marriage?”

“I . . . I don’t think so.” Adam purses his lips and shakes his head.
This is the conversation I’ve been having with him over and over. If
anyone can get through to Adam, it’s Lorraine.

“Have you ever, even before your affair, been happy and content with
your wife?”

“Not really. I was way too young to get married. I think one of the
reasons I got so involved with the soccer leagues was just to do
something away from her.”

“So don’t you think”—and here Lorraine holds Adam’s genogram in front of
him—“that it’s time for someone in your family to make a stand and take
care of their own needs for once? Look at your parents: Your mom is
unhappy and medicating with romance novels and pills while your dad
walls off and keeps busy. This is a behavior that’s been passed down for
generations. And it only takes one courageous person to stop the cycle
of silent suffering and sacrifice.”

“But how?” He seems genuinely stumped.

“By being true to yourself. People always ask how supposedly good German
people could have been complicit in the atrocities of the Nazi regime.
And one part of the answer is: the family system. Children in that time
were taught to be obedient to their fathers, that Father is always
right, and that they must make sacrifices for the parents to whom they
owe their entire existence.” She pauses to make sure we get it. “And
then what happens? The government demands loyalty, obedience, and
sacrifice, until you have a nation of people violating their internal
value system for the Fatherland.”

We sit in silence and take in her words, their apparent truth, and the
profound way in which trauma shapes history. “I’m passionate about what
I’m doing,” she continues, “because I believe that functional parenting
is the secret to world peace. And the only way to make functional
parents is to heal psychological wounds with the same urgency that we
heal physical wounds. Do you get what I’m saying?”

She looks almost beatific as she speaks. “I get it,” Adam responds
enthusiastically.

“So then, tell me, are you are willing to stay in your marriage, even at
the cost of sacrificing yourself and hurting your children?”

He closes his eyes and exhales slowly through his nose. Then he bites
his lower lip and shakes his head. “I agree with what you’re saying one
hundred percent, but I can’t leave. I just can’t. Not while the kids are
still in the house.”

Lorraine’s gaze bores into Adam’s being. “Then I want you to repeat
after me: ‘I will stay in this relationship . . . even at the cost of
sacrificing myself and all my needs . . . and hurting my children.’”

Backed into a corner, Adam blanches. Tears well up in my eyes as I watch
him grapple with the truth. This is exactly what my parents have done—to
themselves, to my brother, to me.

Finally, Adam crosses his arms over his chest, opens his mouth, and, to
everyone in the room’s surprise, repeats Lorraine’s every word. Calvin
and I stare at him slack-jawed. And this is the moment when I finally
understand why I had such a hard time committing to Ingrid after rehab:
Even when we see the truth, trauma still prevents us from reaching it,
like a rockslide blocking the road to our future.

Lorraine turns to us and says, not with the anger we were expecting but
with acceptance and empathy for Adam, “Do you see how strong this is?
How trauma can destroy individuals and nations and generations?”

More than our relationships are at stake here, I think. The future is at
stake.

As Lorraine swings the door open to dismiss us for lunch, we see a sight
that makes our hearts freeze: Joan.

5

Joan looks intently at each of us, singeing us with the coals of her
eyes, then says, unsmiling, “Welcome back, gentlemen.”

Turning to Lorraine, she tells her, sweetly: “See me in my office
tomorrow morning.”

It is the quickest group castration in history. Even Lorraine seems
rattled. A brief shudder runs through her head and shoulders, like a dog
shaking off stress. Then she snaps at us, “Be back here in an hour.”

When we return, she goes to work on Calvin. “Your problem is that you
want unconditional approval and admiration from women,” she says
bluntly. “When you’re with someone you pay for or a young helpless
dependent, you get that. But in a healthy relationship of two people
with equal internal power, sometimes your partner doesn’t agree with you
or support your behavior. And that’s where the real relating begins.”

“So I’m supposed to date someone who doesn’t like me?” Calvin asks,
genuinely confused.

“No, you’re supposed to grow up emotionally so that when someone you
love doesn’t constantly worship you or do what you want, it doesn’t
cause your entire sense of self to crumble.”

As Calvin takes this in, his eyes ring red and he reaches for the
Kleenex. By the time Lorraine turns her attention to me, the sun has
already set. I promise myself that I will listen to her with an open
mind, that I’ll be less stubborn than Adam about whatever truth she’s
about to confront me with.

“Just like Adam has to separate from his wife to take care of himself,
there are some things you need to cut off as well,” she tells me.

“Besides sex and relationships?”

“Absolutely, though of course that depends on what you’ve decided you
want since we last spoke.”

“I talked to Hasse Walum, like you told me. And I just want to overcome
my past so I can have a loving relationship and live my authentic life.”
More specifically, I want to do these things with Ingrid, but this
doesn’t seem like the best time to bring it up.

“How many women who you’ve been sexual with are you still in contact
with?”

“A lot, but I haven’t been seeing them.”

“Then let me ask you”—here it comes, the verbal aikido that will use my
words to topple my beliefs—“is it possible to live your authentic life
if you have inauthentic people around you?”

She’s backed me into a corner, just as she did to Adam and Calvin. Or
more accurately, we’ve already backed ourselves into these corners and
she’s just helping us see the walls.

“Probably not,” I tell her, then correct myself. “No, definitely not.”

“That’s right. To empty out completely, you need to let go of all the
negative messages you received about yourself as a child. And you need
to separate from the lifestyle you created as a reaction to them. So if
you want to take back your life, you’re going to be best served by
ending contact with every female you’ve ever sexualized.”

“Oh god,” I begin, my voice cracking. The pathological accommodator in
me is terrified of rejecting so many people; the adolescent is reminded
of being grounded; the player is afraid to die. No wonder I was able to
keep my pledge to Lorraine relatively easily these last few weeks: They
were just the first baby steps into anhedonia.

At least I now know the answer to my building-blocks question from
earlier: The only way to fix a tower with a faulty base is to knock it
down and rebuild it over a stronger foundation. “So what would be the
most compassionate way to do that?” I ask.

“Why don’t you think about all the different ways women get in touch
with you and all the ways you seek them out, and seal those doors shut
permanently?”

A lump forms in my throat. On the blackboard, Lorraine writes stage two
of her detox plan. All I have to do are four things:

               1.  Change my phone number

               2.  Change my email address

               3.  Block all social networks on my computer

               4.  Don’t give my new information to anyone with tits

And that’s when I reach for the Kleenex.

There are the women I’ve slept with; the women I’ve fooled around with
but haven’t slept with; the women who don’t want to sleep with me but
hopefully one day will change their minds; the women who want to sleep
with me but I don’t want to sleep with them, though maybe on a lonely
night I’d reconsider; the women who want to sleep with me and I want to
sleep with them but there’s a complicating factor like distance or a
boyfriend; the women I want to sleep with but I slept with their friend
and now it’s a little awkward; and all the women I haven’t met yet but
would want to sleep with if I met them.

All told, it’s a lot of women. Nearly a lifetime of work: thousands of
dollars squandered at bars and restaurants, thousands of hours spent
calling and messaging and emailing, thousands of times saying things
like “Does Friday work for you?” and “My ex and I ended things on good
terms” and “I have to show you this video on my computer” and “I didn’t
think this was going to happen either.”

Whenever I haven’t been working, whenever I haven’t been studying,
whenever I haven’t been watching movies or reading books or playing
video games, this has been what my waking life—and some of my sleeping
life—has been about.

And so I sit, frozen in the hotel room in front of my computer, a
hoarder reluctant to part with the detritus of his past. Going sexually
sober for a limited amount of time was a reasonable challenge, but
making a permanent break with every single one of my options is
terrifying when I’m not in a relationship. Yet if I want one last shot
at happiness with Ingrid when I see her again—assuming she hasn’t
completely moved on—then I must prepare for the trip before leaving, not
after.

“Let me help you,” Adam offers. I stand up and he takes my seat,
downloads a program that restricts access to specific websites, then
shields the keyboard from my eyes as he types in a password.

“I’m blocking all pornography, social networking, and dating sites from
your computer,” he informs me. “I used this program with my kids. If
there’s anything you want to post on these sites for your friends, you
can send it to me and I’ll post it for you—if it’s appropriate.”

In just minutes, my pipeline to variety has been sealed shut.

“Now for the email,” Adam says cheerfully, clearly at home taking care
of someone else’s needs.

“Can we do it in stages?” I sit down on the bed. I’m getting dizzy,
lightheaded, nauseous.

“You gotta rip off the Band-Aid.”

“So are you gonna let me file divorce papers for you and your wife,
then?”

He’s not amused.

Adam sets up a new email address for me. I make a list of less than
twenty people—family, close friends, colleagues—to give it to. Then he
changes the password on the old email account to lock me out, and we
write an auto-responder letting everyone else from my past know I can no
longer be reached there.

“Man, this is weird,” I tell Adam. “Feel my hands. I’m shaking.”

I’m like an alcoholic going through the d.t.’s.

“Fortunately for you, there’s nothing I can do with your phone right
now. But not only do you need to get a new number, you also need to get
a flip phone that doesn’t have Internet access.”

“I’ll do that when I’m home,” I respond, grateful for the small
reprieve.

“Think of yourself as Tarzan,” he suggests, repeating advice that
Lorraine once gave him. “You can’t hold onto the vine behind you and the
vine in front of you forever. At some point, you have to let go of the
past to move forward.”

Suddenly, my world has become much smaller. And after the initial fear
and panic of letting go subside, I realize it’s also become much easier
to manage.

7

When we return to the workshop the next day, Lorraine looks more
dispirited than I’ve ever seen her.

“Most of the therapists here are as bad as the patients,” she vents
before the session begins. Something must have happened with Joan this
morning, and it likely has to do with us. “They think their degrees and
certifications give them permission to be one up and constantly in the
adapted adolescent. Last week, Joan shamed one of the men’s groups and
told them that _waitress_ was a sexist word. I talked to her about it,
and I think reporting me was her way of retaliating.” There’s a
weariness in her voice that I haven’t noticed before. “There are so many
rules and politics here that I can’t do what I need to help people.”

We thank her for her dedication and courage. What we don’t say is that,
like Adam, it seems she’s stuck in a relationship that doesn’t meet her
needs.

And she’s therapist-enmeshing us.

For the next three days, Lorraine perseveres, and soon her powers
return—until the moment comes that I’ve been both dreading and hoping
for. She puts each of us into a light trance to go through a more
intense version of chair work that she calls an “emotional root canal.”
I yell at my mother, my father, and the bully who fondled me. And like
last time, the thick black curtain in front of my mind parts to reveal
the truth.

And I see that I’ve been making sex the most important criterion in my
relationships at the expense of my own happiness. There wasn’t one point
in this last year where I searched for a deeper kind of emotional
connection or a greater kind of love. It was all about exploring a
single aspect of relationships: sexuality. And even in that one aspect,
I failed.

At the puja and in the sex-positive community, I found countless women
who were sexually liberated and open, and required only one thing—that
they be empowered and in control of the context, because that’s how they
felt safe enough to truly let go. And I was uncomfortable with that. Did
I ever really see who Kamala Devi was or did I just see my mother? Could
San Francisco have worked if I wasn’t so hell-bent on making it go
exactly my way and resenting anyone who threatened that? Why was the
relationship with Sage so great until she wanted her freedom and I lost
my absolute control? And why, in so many of these experiences, could I
not let go when I felt vulnerable around women—not to mention other men?

The answer: I was never actually pursuing sexual freedom. I was pursuing
control, power, and self-worth. I was either acting like my mom or
making someone into my mom. But rarely was I actually myself. Because,
as I witnessed on ecstasy, the feeling that I’m not acceptable as I am
is so fucking overwhelming that I’m terrified to let go and just be
myself with anyone.

I’ve been the benevolent dictator of not just everyone else, but also my
own fucking self.

As this last insight hits home, I dissolve into a puddle of tears.
Lorraine waits as I wipe my nose on the back of my hand, then she speaks
slowly and gently: “All the things you’ve been trying to get from these
relationships—freedom, understanding, fairness, acceptance—are exactly
the things that you never got from your mom. So every time you load all
that unfinished business onto your partner, you’re setting yourself up
for another disappointment. Because as an adult, the only person who can
give you those things is you. Do you understand that?”

“Yes,” I tell her. “I do.”

And I really do.

She invites Adam to the chair next, and proceeds to blow his mind. When
he opens his eyes afterward, they’re brilliantly beaming. And in a
happy-go-lucky voice that differs from his usual beaten-down and
measured tone, he exclaims, “I want some ice cream!”

His inner child, whose needs he’s been repressing his whole life, has
finally spoken up. It’s probably been decades since he’s allowed himself
to enjoy even a morsel of sugar.

This process is the closest thing I’ve seen to a miracle.

An hour later, we’re eating ice cream.

“I’ve missed me,” Adam says between shovelfuls of an Oreo-topped sundae
that Lorraine went out and bought for him. Calvin sits mutely nearby,
shell-shocked from his own epiphany, which is that if you become the
hero in an enmeshed family as an adult, accepting that role will occupy
the space your heart has available for a relationship. So Lorraine
insisted that he draw strong boundaries with his parents, even though he
feels that they need him right now.

Meanwhile, I work up the nerve to tell Lorraine about the wedding
invitation from Ingrid’s brother. When she doesn’t seem to disapprove of
my attending, I ask her the question that’s been worrying me since Machu
Picchu: “How will I know I’m truly ready this time and not one of those
love avoiders who wants to be in a relationship when he isn’t in one,
then wants to be free when he’s in a relationship?”

Lorraine responds cryptically, “Do you know the story of the Prodigal
Son?”

Adam nods his head vigorously, melted ice cream dribbling down his face.
He knows his Bible well. Lorraine tells us her version of the story
anyway:

“A father has two sons. The older one is a good son. He does everything
he should, pleases the father, and stays on the farm to take care of it.
The younger one leaves the family, spends all his father’s money on
prostitutes, doesn’t stay in touch, almost starves to death, and then,
finally, returns and begs to be allowed to take care of the farm with
his brother again.

“When the father throws a huge celebration to welcome his youngest son
back home, the older brother asks, ‘What about me?’ And do you know what
the father replies?”

“He says that a Christian should always be merciful and allow someone to
repent?” Adam tries.

“Perhaps. But I like to believe he also said something else: ‘You worked
on the farm because you felt like you should; your brother came back to
work on the farm out of choice. And that is the more meaningful of the
two.’”

She pauses and lets it sink in for all of us. “Love is something about a
person, some connection with them, that makes you willing to change.”

As Adam scrapes the sides of his bowl clean, I realize why monogamy
never worked for me before. It’s always been something that I felt my
partner expected or made me do. If I treat it as a choice this time as
opposed to a demand, then maybe I can be the Prodigal Boyfriend.

Lorraine sees the hope illuminating my face and quickly warns, “You, my
friend, are on a deadline to love right now. If you want any hope of
being in a relationship with Ingrid again, you’re going to have to
attack your trauma with all the commitment you have and every tool there
is before that wedding. Only after you’ve learned how to be alone
without loneliness will you be ready for a relationship.”

“What other tools are there?” I ask.

She lists them for me: a litany of therapies designed to work on
different senses. They’re unfamiliar—word combinations I’ve never heard
before. But I write them down like a prescription.

“My biggest worry,” I tell her, “is that after I did the chair work with
you last time, I felt just like this. I had so much clarity and hope.
But when I returned to my normal environment, I totally reverted to my
old thoughts and behaviors.”

She holds her fingers to her lips and considers the dilemma for a
moment. “As you peel away the layers of the false self, you’re going to
start feeling the pain inside that it’s protecting you from. So you’re
going to get very raw and uncomfortable before you get better. I think
you may have gotten stuck in those feelings last time and that’s why you
left Ingrid. But if you can process all that old pain in an adult,
healthy way this time, you won’t need your old walls and defenses
anymore.”

It’s a lot to take in and I struggle to understand it all. Then I decide
I don’t need to understand it. I just need to do it.

There’s only one problem: “What if afterward, I go to the wedding and
I’m truly ready in my heart and soul to commit, and Ingrid’s with
someone else or doesn’t want to be with me again?”

Lorraine’s eyes smile into mine, makeup cracked over the lids like dry
earth, as she answers without hesitation: “If she doesn’t want you back
and she’s the catalyst for this change, then she’s the best thing that
ever happened to you.”

Curtis Rouanzoin waves a thin metal rod back and forth in front of my
eyes as I recall memories of my mother. He then places headphones over
my ears and plays tones that jump from the right earpiece to the left
one as I keep remembering and feeling pain, remembering and feeling
pain—until I’m just remembering.

Lindsay Joy Greene ducks as I send my fist flying into the air with all
my strength, releasing anger that feels like it’s been trapped in my
wrist for decades. I do it over and over again with each hand, until I
just don’t need to anymore.

Olga Stevko spends eight hours hypnotizing me. I walk around her office,
entering the minds of my parents in search of the things they didn’t get
from their parents. Then I imagine flowing these qualities to each
person in my family back seven generations and then forward to me in the
moment I was conceived, until I feel like I actually grew up with them.

Greg Cason gives me homework. Lots of it. Thought records, goal sheets,
written exposures, gratitude diaries, behavioral experiments—each one
chipping away at my fears and pathological accommodation until I can see
them as the delusions they are.

Barbara McNally tells me to close my eyes; picture myself and my mother
in a room with a white light coming from me and an _X_ over her; and
then imagine yelling, “Give me the fucking keys!” as I punch her in the
face repeatedly.

I am at war. It is a strange fucking war. But I am winning.

“On a scale of one to ten, how strong is the emotion attached to the
memories we’ve been working on?” Curtis Rouanzoin asks one day. The
procedure I’ve been going through with him is called EMDR, or eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing, which looks at the way trauma
is stored in the brain and attempts to properly process it.

“If it used to be a ten, now it’s an eight,” I tell him.

Lindsay Joy Greene is trained in a therapy called SE, or somatic
experiencing, and she’s been locating trauma trapped not in my brain,
but in my body, and releasing the stored energy. One day she asks, “On a
scale of one to ten, how much anger do you feel when you recall the
memories we’ve been discussing?”

“If it used to be an eight, now it’s a seven,” I tell her.

Olga Stevko practices her own variant of NLP, or neuro-linguistic
programming. Where the experientials with Lorraine were about debugging
my operating system, her process is about rewriting the original code.
For example, she tells me that inside my mother’s words, “Never grow up
to make anyone as miserable as your father makes me,” was a hidden
command: _Never grow up._ As she helps me grow up, it brings my trauma
down to a six.

Greg Cason specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy, which takes it
to a five. And I don’t know what to call Barbara McNally’s method and
her bottomless quiver of techniques, but they work, they’re original,
and they bring the emotion associated with those memories to a four. And
I do so much more: I beat pillows with baseball bats. I tap on energy
meridians. I make shadow maps of my dark side. I try psychodrama. Not
all of it works, but none of it hurts.

One morning, I notice that half the boxer shorts in my dresser are gifts
my mother has given me for various birthdays and holidays. Most are
novelty themed with semisexual jokes on them, like male and female
gender signs with the words “change often” next to them. Though I feel a
pang of guilt as I scoop them up and toss them in the trash, I recall
Barbara McNally telling me that this kind of guilt is a good thing. It
means that I’m finally doing the work of separation.

While I’m at it, I throw away all the keys to old cars and apartments
that I’ve saved in some unconscious attempt to prove to my mother that I
won’t ever lose them.

As Lorraine predicted, I feel fragile and vulnerable during this
shock-and-awe campaign, as if my skin has been removed and all my nerves
exposed. The slightest stress—be it a small criticism from a colleague,
an obstacle standing in the way of a project I need to complete, someone
asking me to repeat myself, a restaurant being out of my favorite
dish—fills me with disproportionate anxiety and rage. Even if a person
says something nice to me, I misinterpret it as rude and disrespectful.
And every night, I toss and turn, obsessing over the events of the last
few years, unable to fall asleep.

“This isn’t making me happy,” I complain to Rick one dark morning.

“The purpose is not to feel good or have fun,” Rick reminds me. “It’s to
force feelings to surface so they can be examined, and to find the
deeper causes for your behavior. In that respect, it’s working amazingly
well. How you feel during the process is the least important part. So
you can feel good to the extent that you’re doing the work to learn
about yourself and you’re willing to look at the feelings that come up.
That’s the part to hold on to.”

So I push through the pain and fight harder. It eats into my bank
account, but in the long run I’m saving thousands of times this amount
of money on bad dates, dramatic relationships, short-lived marriages,
poor decisions, and the false friends I’m trauma-bonded to.

I am motivated by the mistakes of the past, the hope of a better future,
the desperate dream of Ingrid, and the feeling deep down that finally,
after all this searching, I’m doing the right thing. Not just for Ingrid
or for my relationships, but for me. Instead of trying to find other
people to complete me, I am finally completing myself.

Today, I’m doing something even more excruciating than therapy. I’m
sitting at an STI clinic, preparing to get tested for literally
everything.

As I wait to see the nurse, I think of all the women I was with while
dating Sage: the one whose period started shortly after I went down on
her, the one who dropped her ass on me before I had a chance to put a
condom on, the one who the rubber slipped off inside, and then all the
women who went down on me while I basically had an open sore on my dick.
And what if that sore wasn’t from friction?

Then there’s Sage: She said she was clean, but who knows when she was
last tested?

I don’t think I could show my face to Ingrid again if I caught something
during this time. What if this whole quest for freedom has instead
sentenced me to death? What if instead of having my cake and eating it,
I end up having no cake and nothing to eat?

I call for my test results several stress-filled days later. As the
nurse looks for them, my heart curls into a tight ball. My forehead
knits. Even my dick is tense, as if a guillotine blade is about to drop
onto it.

Finally, she returns to the phone. “You’re negative for HIV, chlamydia,
gonorrhea, and . . .” I silently rejoice, but then she hesitates, as if
about to say something awkward. The rejoicing ends.

“This is odd,” she continues. Fuck, I knew something was wrong. What if
it’s incurable? “You tested negative for herpes.”

“Negative?”

“Just about everyone has herpes,” she says, as if it’s the equivalent of
pimples.

And in that moment, I’m grateful to my parents for their immune system.
“Thank you,” I tell her. “I think I love you.”

“I love you too, honey,” she says and hangs up, my blood-drawing angel.

One advantage to monogamy: no more terrifying STI tests.

Relieved and reprieved, I continue the war on my past.

There are, of course, experiences that I can’t access: preconscious,
early childhood, and forgotten imprints. And surely a great deal of the
damage is done in those crucial first few years. But when I ask about it
at a weekend workshop just outside Los Angeles run by a trauma-healing
center called The Refuge, I’m reassured that what I remember is a window
into what I’ve forgotten—that the patterns likely stayed the same, that
a narcissistic parent was always a narcissistic parent.

On my way home from The Refuge workshop, I stop by my friend Melanie’s
birthday party at a West Hollywood bar. Since starting this voyage into
anhedonia, it’s one of the only social events I’ve attended. I’m wearing
jeans and a hoodie, feeling very anti-social, and planning to just give
Melanie her present and then duck out.

But as soon as I walk in the door, I spot trouble: Elizabeth, the tech
entrepreneur Melanie introduced me to years ago—the one who said she’d
have sex with me only if I agreed to marry her.

“I’ve been trying to reach you,” she says in greeting. She’s wearing a
low-cut green dress and black strappy stilettos.

“I changed my number,” I tell her, polite but curt.

She continues, unfazed: “I’ve had a little to drink, so I can tell you
this. You’re part of the reason I broke things off with my boyfriend. I
made a list of the qualities I look for in men. Then I made a list of
the potential men in my life. Then I compiled all the data on a graph,
and you rated highest in every category except one.”

I get the sneaking suspicion that she prepared this ambush in advance.
“Let me guess,” I respond dispassionately. “Stability.”

“That’s exactly it.” She holds eye contact. “The first thing I thought
when I broke up with him was, Now I can fuck Neil Strauss.”

I’ve never been hit on this aggressively. Either she’s relaxed her
marriage criteria or she’s a subscriber to the twins’
dangle-the-sexual-carrot theory of seduction. The old me would be
intrigued enough to find out which; the new me is intrigued for a
fleeting moment, but fortunately he makes better decisions.
“Unfortunately, you’re too late, because I’m off the market.”

I start to walk away, but she asks after me: “You’re not still in love
with that blond girl, are you?” She sneers the word _girl_ as if she’s
saying _peasant_.

I stop and tell her, “I am, actually.” The words are much easier to
articulate than I would have imagined.

“I don’t think she’s at your level.” Elizabeth is undeterred. “I saw a
photo of you two online. Her nail polish was chipped.”

Now that I’m not seeing Elizabeth—or any woman—as a means to a sexual
end, I’m astonished that I was ever interested in her. If I were dying
of altitude sickness in Machu Picchu, she’s the type who’d leave if she
saw a rich guy landing in a helicopter nearby. “That’s the great thing
about Ingrid,” I inform her. “She doesn’t define herself by her looks.
One day, she sent me photos she’d put into some apps, and they showed
what she’d look like fat and old.”

This is when Elizabeth says the one thing that, until recently, would
have affected my last ounce of resolve like kryptonite. “Since our talk,
I’ve decided that I want a more open relationship. I don’t want to keep
a man from exploring his sexuality or having experiences with other
women. I think it’s natural for a man to want variety.”

“Well, I hope you find someone.” I’m grateful to find myself unmoved by
her words. Either I’m healing or I’m just really irritable from all this
wound-scraping. “Good seeing you again.”

Instead of saying goodbye, she kneels at my feet, a still life of
submission. She then slowly ties the loose laces on one of my shoes,
gazing up at me the whole time, edging into the space between my legs
and then freezing there for a moment to give my mind’s eye the exact
picture it needs to imagine what could still happen tonight.

This is the moment the red demons and I always talked about, wondering
if we could resist the lure of easy sex with a beautiful woman.

Elizabeth slowly rises to her feet, letting her freshly polished nails
linger on my arm as a testament to her superiority over Ingrid. Sensing
victory, she purrs, “My mother always used to say, ‘If you thought it,
then you already cheated.’”

“Well, I’ll just have to live with that.” I bid her a final goodbye and
walk off to greet Melanie. Fortunately, it turns out I can resist.

As I head home a little later, feeling like the target instead of the
player, I’m unexpectedly elated. This is the first time I’ve turned down
sex from a potential partner I’m physically attracted to and, more so, a
nonmonogamous relationship. And I have no regrets. If Ingrid knelt on
the ground to tie my shoelaces, it would be because she wanted to tie my
shoelaces, not because she wanted to seduce me into thinking she’d be
the perfect wife.

I think back to the photos that Ingrid texted me, the ones with her face
altered to look unflattering. The message that accompanied them read:
“Let’s grow old and fat together.”

I wondered in Peru what love was. That is love. It’s when two (or more)
hearts build a safe emotional, mental, and spiritual home that will
stand strong no matter how much anyone changes on the inside or the
outside. It demands only one thing and expects only one thing: that each
person be his or her own true self. Everything else we attach to love is
just a personal strategy, be it effective or ineffective, for trying to
manage our anxiety about coming so close to something so powerful and
uncontrollable.

I return to the tree house, which is free of chaos and clutter, and to
bed, which is free of cigarette smoke, condom wrappers, and wet spots
from spilled drinks and other fluids. And I realize that I made a
mistake by equating variety with freedom.

I’m off all social and dating apps and websites. That’s freedom.

Less than twenty people have my email address. That’s freedom.

My phone barely makes a sound. That’s freedom.

I have my life back. That’s freedom.

I didn’t catch anything communicable. That’s a fucking relief.

I am truly alone, bereft of options for the first time since puberty.
And, oddly, I don’t mind at all. It turns out that leaving all my
options open has kept me too busy juggling them to really live. Studies
on choice even affirm that having too many options leads to less
happiness and satisfaction.

I think back to my childhood—to the irrational rules and the bedside
conversations and the constant criticism—and I feel nothing. On a scale
of one to ten, it’s now a one.

The following week, something snaps.

It begins when I’m talking to my mother on the phone. We haven’t spoken
for a while because I’ve been avoiding anything that could interfere
with the work I’m doing. But when she mentions that this year will be
her forty-ninth wedding anniversary, I walk right into her trap and ask,
“Do you want anything special for your fiftieth anniversary?”

“No,” she replies with scorn. “Why would I want anything honoring that?”
She pauses, then decides, “Well, there is something you can do for my
fiftieth anniversary: Shoot your father.” She laughs, as if it’s funny,
then adds as an afterthought, “Actually, if you wanted to shoot him for
my forty-ninth anniversary, that would be fine too.”

Her comment doesn’t bother me or make me feel like I’m being
asphyxiated, nor does it cause me to feel sorry for her or for Dad. It
just rolls off me, like a child’s attempt to recruit a stranger in a
personal vendetta.

That’s when I see our relationship as if it were a movie—with distance,
detachment, and clarity. It’s a black comedy about a mother who feels
victimized by her husband, yet too broken to do anything about it, so
nearly everything in her life, including her own son, becomes a weapon
to use or an ally to recruit in her private, solitary war against this
oblivious man.

As I end the conversation with her, not only do I let go of any
remaining expectations that she’ll be nurturing or mothering, but I let
go, without guilt, of any obligations I owe her as my mother. And it is
this moment of release—of changing her role in my life from mother to
adapted adolescent—that ultimately frees me.

With that original trauma bond broken, in the days that follow, I’m
possessed by a feeling I’ve never experienced before. In fact, it’s hard
to actually call it a feeling. It is the absence of feeling.

Sometimes I’ll sit on the couch and just listen to the sounds outside,
look around the room and through the window, and think about nothing. Or
I’ll move through the house in slow motion, disconnected from my usual
sense of urgency, going about everyday behaviors like brushing my teeth
as if they’re the only things I have to do in my lifetime. It’s like
zoning out, except there’s nowhere to zone out to. It’s as if there’s
nothing in my head. I don’t even know if I feel good or bad. I’m beyond
good and bad. I just am.

When I try to sleep at night, my breathing seems light, like it’s not
filling my lungs with the oxygen they need. My heartbeat seems faint,
like it might stop at any time. My mind seems slow, as if my neurons are
degenerating and I’m drifting into a painless death.

I’ve finally emptied out. I’ve Forrest Gumped myself. I am truly in
anhedonia—if not in a void beyond it.

There’s just one problem: Lorraine never told me what I was supposed to
fill up with afterward. So I email her to find out.

She doesn’t respond.

A few days later, I try her again.

And still there’s nothing.

I’m reminded of Ingrid’s deadly silence, yet it doesn’t feel like
abandonment. I’m too empty to feel even pain. I am, as Lorraine
predicted, deeply alone, but without a trace of loneliness.

As the week passes without a response from Lorraine, I start to wonder
quite apathetically if she’s turned me into a zombie, doomed to spend
the rest of my life brain-dead.

I call her and leave a message, asking in a slow, confused voice what
the next step is and how to fill up. But still she doesn’t respond.

And she never will.

I look into his face. The first thing I notice is the smile, all gums
and crooked teeth. Then there are the black glasses, too large and harsh
for his face. And most tragically, there’s the hair, cut amateurishly
short with crooked bangs and random wavy lumps. Yet despite all this,
there’s something about him that’s delightful to look at. It’s not just
his innocence and naïveté, but his eagerness to please, to learn, to
become.

And that’s when it happens: Something finally moves in me. It appears to
be a feeling. It’s hard to tell whether it’s love or sadness. Quite
possibly it’s both. But it’s pure. A love and a sadness—for him, for
myself.

I’m looking at an elementary-school class photo of myself, age eight,
which I dug out of an envelope buried in my file cabinet. I can’t
remember the last time I looked at my childhood photos.

I am filling up, and I’m doing it on my own.

Both Adam and Calvin called earlier in the day, panicked because they
were experiencing their own crises and hadn’t heard back from Lorraine
either. Fortunately, Calvin gave me the clue I needed. He read the last
email Lorraine had sent him, which concluded with the advice: “You have
your own internal therapist that is far wiser than any external
therapist you could consult. You just need to find that voice and listen
to it.”

It seemed like her way of saying goodbye, though we had no idea why.
Maybe we were taking up too much of her time; maybe this was tough love;
or maybe Joan had gotten her suspended for working with patients who’d
left rehab AMA. Whatever her reasons may have been, those final words
were worth taking seriously.

So I sat in my zone-out couch and reflected on what had brought me up to
this point. The first steps were doing a timeline and genogram, which
allowed me to identify my wounds. The second steps were the intense
therapeutic processes, which emptied and cleaned out the wounds. So the
third step must be to fill in the holes left by them.

But fill them with what?

Something Lorraine said the first time we did chair work drifted into my
mind. She asked me to protect and look after my inner child.

So I rose from the sofa and rummaged around the file cabinet until I
found my old photos. When I truly saw for the first time the wounded
child I’d been working so hard to heal, that’s when the feelings began
to come back.

I used to think that the term _inner child_ was a ridiculous metaphor
invented to remind responsibility-burdened adults to lighten up
occasionally and just have fun. But it turns out that the inner child is
very real. It is our past. And the only way to escape the past is to
embrace it.

So before going to bed that night, I put the photo in a frame and place
it next to my bed. And I vow that from this day forward, that child will
be protected. He will be loved. He will be accepted. He will be trusted.
And all this will be given unconditionally. He will not be taught to
hate and fear. He will not be criticized for failing to live up to
unrealistic expectations. He will not be used as a Kleenex or aspirin
for someone else’s feelings of loneliness, fear, depression, or anxiety.

The next morning, I start filling him—and me—with the things I needed
but never had as a child. When I have a negative thought about myself, I
gently replace it with a positive truth. When I make a mistake, I
forgive myself. When I’m too thin-skinned or thick-skinned, I gently
guide myself back into moderate reality. And when I regress, I silently
soothe myself as if teaching a child not to be afraid of the dark.

Just as I told Anne to be a good mother to herself, I’m reparenting
myself. It’s somewhat pathetic that at this age, I need to properly
learn how to be an adult. But if the problems I have in relationships
are the result of developmental immaturities, then by nurturing these
stunted parts of myself into a growth spurt, perhaps I’ll finally attain
the happiness and stability that have eluded me through them all.

So with this small crack of light shining into my numbness, I start
creating a new life.

Each day, I try to take care of the six core needs Lorraine told me
about: _physical,_ by surfing and eating healthily; _emotional,_ by
allowing myself to experience and express feelings without being either
hypercontrolling or out of control with them; _social,_ by spending time
with Adam, Calvin, Rick, and other growth-minded friends;
_intellectual,_ by reading literature, listening to lectures, starting a
film discussion group, and, most importantly, simply listening more;
and, most alien of all for me, _spiritual,_ through transcendental
meditation, which a friend of Rick’s teaches me.

But the biggest challenge is the sixth core need: _sexual,_ especially
since I’m chaste and porn-free right now. So while continuing with the
rest of my self-care regimen, I decide to skip this one. I’ve fulfilled
enough sexual needs to last several lifetimes. And maybe it’s for the
best that Lorraine never responded, because now it’s truly my life that
I’m rebuilding. I’ve cleansed the childhood wounds and I’m filling the
holes inside. All my life, I’ve been trying to fill the wrong holes.

12

Six days before Hans’s wedding—and just a couple of weeks into my new
self-care regimen—I wake up and the last remnants of torpor, deadness,
and apathy have lifted like storm clouds. In their place, I see a blue
sky I forgot was ever there.

I’ve finally been un-Gumped. All those nights I lay in bed during
anhedonia feeling like my heartbeat and breathing were fading to
nothing, I wasn’t dying or even close to it. My switching speed was
simply slowing down, and the lack of constant stress, anxiety, and
intensity felt alien to me.

Suddenly I realize that the dichotomy between the false self and the
authentic self that all these recovery people talk about is meaningless.
It’s a value judgment that’s impossible to determine. A better way to
think about it is the destructive self and the creative self: the _you_
that damages your life and the lives of others, and the _you_ that
brings forth the best in yourself, is connected to others, and is in
harmony with the world around you.

All morning I’m struck by epiphanies. It’s as if by emptying out and
then simply taking care of myself, truth is pouring in spontaneously and
effortlessly, without my having to consult experts to find it.

“You seem happier and more at peace than I’ve ever seen you,” Rick says
when I meet him for lunch at Coogie’s a few days later. “And there’s
something else different about you too, but I can’t put my finger on
it.” He looks me over slowly, nodding, as if giving a spiritual CAT
scan. “Maybe you healed something in you.”

He’s not the first person to say that. Nearly everyone I’ve seen lately
has noticed a change—not in my appearance, but in my being. Things I
never before thought I could change—such as my tendency to snap into
anger when hemmed in by irrational rules—have completely evaporated.
Where before I was anxious, frenetic, and nervous, now I’m more present,
still, accepting. I’m hardly a Buddhist monk, but I’m more at peace with
the world and with myself.

“I know. I feel different. I thought this was just to change my beliefs
about sex, but it’s shifted everything.”

“How you do anything is how you do everything,” Rick responds, with a
calmness that for once I mirror. “Do you see now that the way you choose
to live your life affects everything about it? A cheat here and there is
not just a cheat here and there. It’s a break in the continuum of who
you are and the person you are in the world.”

“I get that. I think I have a good understanding now of why I cheated.”

“And why is that?” The words sound vaguely challenging, like a test to
make sure I really have changed.

“It’s actually a list of things.”

I pull out my phone and show him a memo I wrote one night in bed during
anhedonia:

WHY I CHEATED

               1.  I didn’t communicate or keep boundaries with Ingrid,
so I acted out due to fear of engulfment.

               2.  I didn’t share my sexual preferences with Ingrid or
give her space to share hers, so I acted out due to unfulfilled sexual
desires.

               3.  I blamed her for “not allowing me” to fuck other
people, so I acted out due to a denial of personal responsibility for my
behavior.

               4.  I had feelings of worthlessness and low self-esteem
deep down, so I acted out for acceptance and validation.

               5.  I had no spirituality and a faulty intellectual
paradigm, so I acted out because I believed we’re no different from any
other animal and that’s what animals do, and the consequences don’t
really matter to the universe.

For once, Rick is speechless. A smile slowly spreads across his face.
And after what feels like eternity, he tells me, “I think you’re going
to understand what I mean now when I tell you the secret to being
faithful.”

“What’s that?”

“Don’t trade long-term happiness for short-term pleasure.”

I add that phrase to my notes. It’s a good mantra to remember.

“Think of intimacy as a fire,” he continues. “The more logs you add to
it, the bigger it gets. And the bigger it gets, the less you want to
throw water on it.”

“My problem before was that the bigger the fire got, the _more_ I wanted
to throw water on it. I was so scared it would consume me.”

Rick studies my face. Words are easy to say, but am I capable yet of
living by them? Another test percolates in his mind. He is a producer
not just of music, but of lives. “If things don’t work out with Ingrid,
in order to give your next relationship a chance, I would recommend
building intimacy and making a deep emotional commitment _before_
beginning a sexual relationship. I think that should be your new
challenge: to wait three months before having sex with your next
girlfriend.”

He waits for my reaction. When I accused Rick and Lorraine of trying to
castrate me after they first suggested anhedonia months ago, it only
confirmed to them my unhealthy obsession with sex. This time, though, I
don’t overreact. If I want to have a heart-based relationship, his
challenge makes sense. It takes time to let go of our projections and
unmet developmental needs so we can see our partners as they really are
and for them to see who we are.

“You know, three months sounds like a long time,” I tell Rick. “But if
I’d done that in the first place, I probably wouldn’t have wasted so
many years of my life in the wrong relationships.”

Yet as I speak those words, I feel a small flutter of discomfort with
the idea, and a rising fear from deep inside that surprises me: Will
someone want to commit to me without the sex and the oxytocin of orgasm?
This would mean that she’d actually have to like me for who I am.

And a powerful voice from somewhere else inside me rises and cradles the
fear like a child, telling it, simply, “Yes, she will.”

13

After watching John Frankenheimer’s _All Fall Down_ with my movie group
that night, I’m struck by a troubling chain of thoughts: I emerged from
anhedonia with not so much a decision but a _knowing_ that I was ready
for an adult relationship with Ingrid. But what if I’ve changed so much
that my wounds and her wounds are no longer complementary, and we’re not
attracted to each other anymore? Or what if she’s angry at me and just
over it? Or what if she’s madly in love with that James Dean guy? And
even if she is single and doesn’t hate my guts, how is she going to
believe I’ve changed? I’ve told her that before, only to break her heart
later.

So I decide to bring proof to the wedding. I spend the next few days
gathering the materials I need. In a box marked “#1,” I insert a framed
photograph of the Survivor. “Thank you for the plant,” I write on the
back. “It has taught me that I can take care of things. The following
packages are not gifts, but expressions of my commitment to you. I’ve
worked hard on who I am and on becoming a better person. And I’ve
learned that with love, anything can bloom. But with ambivalence and
fear, a living thing will die. So no one who truly loves and is loved
can ever be in a cage.”

In box two, I place my old phone, along with a note explaining the new
number, who I’ve given it to, and that I’m now giving it to the person I
care most about in the world as well. Inside box three is the receipt
for the program blocking all my social networking and the bounceback
message from my old email address. Box four takes half a day to prepare:
I set up a spaceship room similar to the one she’d made in our old
guesthouse, and take a photo of it for her. Box five contains my most
prized possession, my only key to the private beach where I surf—my
version of the filing cabinet key of trust she gave me. And inside box
six is a locket with photos of me as a child on one side and her as a
child on the other, with a message: “Little Neil was scared. Adult Neil
is not. The only fear he has is of losing you. Let’s be great parents to
our inner children together.”

I wrap each box, and place them all in a larger box. I’m leaping out of
the plane without a parachute, committing to her on the basis of faith
alone, loving her without requiring her love—and either it’s the most
romantic thing I’ve ever done or the most stalker-like. Possibly both.

Some schools of attachment theory assess the way people behave in
relationships on a continuum, rather than by clear-cut categories like
in rehab. They place people on a graph divided into four quadrants,
running from low anxiety to high anxiety on the x-axis and high
avoidance to low avoidance on the y-axis. Each quadrant determines a
different attachment style: High avoidance and high anxiety would be
_fearful-avoidant attachment,_ similar to love avoidance; high anxiety
and low avoidance would be _preoccupied attachment,_ similar to love
addiction; high avoidance and low anxiety would be _dismissing
attachment,_ a more extreme form of love avoidance in which
relationships are rejected almost altogether because no partner is
perceived as worthy. So for fun, I take a test to determine which style
I have, answering each question as honestly as I can. And I’m relieved
when I fall into the fourth category: low avoidance and low anxiety.

“Combining your anxiety and avoidance scores, you fall into the _secure_
region of the space,” my analysis reads. And though it’s just an online
test, it’s also the first positive psychiatric evaluation I’ve had in a
long time.

I then read through my notes from the last few years. I look back on
every conversation, meeting, book, appointment, intensive, and internal
epiphany I’ve experienced. And I start writing a compendium of all the
lessons I’ve learned.

It is my center, an incomplete guide to love for the incomplete man, a
map to success not just in my relationships but to safely handling all
the outer and inner forces that can threaten them. It is my reminder to
take care of myself, communicate my needs, stay away from the dark side,
and keep from getting sucked back into my childhood reality. And it
contains much more: ways to cope with the urge to cheat, to avoid
turning my partner into my parent, to prevent over-reactions, to resolve
conflicts, to make sure I’m growing closer to my partner over time
instead of into a stranger.

My progress on it, however, is interrupted by a soft knocking on the
front door.

“Who is it?” I ask cautiously, hopefully.

“It’s me,” a woman’s voice says shyly.

“Ingrid?”

“No,” the voice responds. “It’s Sage.”

Excerpts from An Incomplete Guide to Love for the Incomplete Man

1. NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION MAY BE, THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION IS
ALWAYS COMPASSION AND LOVE.

“I flew in to talk to you. Can you just open the door?”

I want to hide. I want to run. I can’t let this get in the way of my
plans.

But there are plans and then there is life. And life trumps plans every
time.

“What are you doing here?” I ask as empathically as I can.

2. AS LONG AS AT LEAST ONE PARTNER IS IN THE ADULT FUNCTIONAL AT ANY
GIVEN TIME, MOST—IF NOT ALL—ARGUMENTS CAN BE AVOIDED.

“This is crazy, I know. I’ve been trying to reach you to apologize. I
made a mistake. I love you.” Pause. Silence. “I got scared, so I ran
away, but I’m not scared anymore. I want to be with you. I hope you care
about me enough to at least give me five minutes of your time.”

I hesitate for a moment, widening the space between the emotion I’m
feeling and acting on it. The emotion I’m feeling is fear. I’m worried
she’ll do something that will affect my newly won clarity or my chances
of getting back together with Ingrid. So I summon all my adult brain
cells to a meeting in my neocortex and remind them that no one can hurt
me without my permission.

3. RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU ARE BACKSLIDING INTO A CHILDISH OR ADOLESCENT
BEHAVIOR. THEN PINPOINT WHAT OLD STORY IS BEING TRIGGERED AND TELL
YOURSELF THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION. LET GO OF THE LIE.

From a distant flank of my brain, however, the small, ragged remains of
a once-formidable army of guilt tries to invade. She flew all this way,
so I must not disappoint her or hurt her. I squash the voice instantly
as the pathological accommodation it is—the old belief that because my
mom loves me, I must never do anything to make her suffer. And just
about everything makes her suffer.

Love is a cage only when you feel indebted to it, constrained by it,
responsible to its owner.

4. ACCEPT WHAT IS.

With one army vanquished, the next attacks: the terror of self-doubt.
What if this is how I sound when I see Ingrid? What if Ingrid thinks
exactly what I’m thinking right now? What if she’s right?

_What if . . ._ Today I will expunge those two words from my vocabulary
and replace them with _I will accept it if_.

I will accept it if this is how I sound when I see Ingrid. I will accept
it if Ingrid thinks exactly what I’m thinking right now. I will accept
it if she’s right.

5. INSTEAD OF SAYING “I’M NEVER GOING TO CHEAT AGAIN,” SAY, “TODAY, I’M
NOT GOING TO DO THAT THING THAT MAKES ME FEEL WEAK AND SHAMEFUL ABOUT
MYSELF AGAIN.”

And then the final phalanx marches toward me, the most dangerous of all:
desire. It tells me how great the sex with Sage was and how fun the
threesomes were. And I attack it with the best weapon there is:
experience. I remind it that besides the lonely night with the twins,
the adventure before that involved a neighbor who brought her giant
husky over, and Sage and she made love while the dog tried to make love
to me.

Perhaps the corollary to Rick’s secret is that the fantasy of other
people is almost always better than the reality.

I open the door and guard the threshold. Sage stands before me in full
club makeup and a black dress, with her hair freshly dyed and her legs
perfectly tanned. She’s clearly spent a lot of time working on herself.
And, more worryingly, there’s a suitcase at her feet.

She reaches out to hug and kiss me, and I back away. I will not feel
sorry for her. I will not be turned on by her.

6. YOU CAN’T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE HOPING THEY’LL CHANGE. YOU
HAVE TO BE WILLING TO COMMIT TO THEM AS THEY ARE, WITH NO EXPECTATIONS.
AND IF THEY HAPPEN TO CHOOSE TO CHANGE AT SOME POINT ALONG THE WAY, THEN
THAT’S JUST A BONUS.

Words start tumbling out of her mouth, concluding with her desire to
move in and start a family with me. It sends a chill up my spine,
because this is exactly what I want with Ingrid if things work out
between us.

“You want to move in, stay with me forever, and start a family
together?”

“Yes,” she says, her eyes widening with equal parts sincerity and
supplication.

I picture what the future would actually be like with Sage: I imagine us
married and raising children—until one day when she feels trapped again,
she runs away to Fiji without warning, leaving me to explain to the kids
that Mommy left to search for herself and I don’t know when she’s coming
back. The winds of ambivalence will continue blowing her back to me and
away again, back and away, back and away.

They say that love is blind, but it’s trauma that’s blind. Love sees
what is.

7. COMMUNICATE AND MAINTAIN HEALTHY BOUNDARIES. THIS MEANS FINDING THE
PROPER BALANCE OF FILTERING AND PROTECTING YOUR SELF, THOUGHTS,
FEELINGS, TIME, AND BEHAVIORS WITHOUT EITHER CLOSING OFF BEHIND WALLS,
OR BECOMING OVERWHELMED OR OVERWHELMING.

She looks forlorn and expectant, and every now and then tears fall from
her eyes as she tells me that she spent her savings to fly out here.
Until recently, this was my nightmare: having to meet other people’s
expectations—especially when doing what’s right for me hurts someone
else’s feelings. But it was her choice to come here, so there’s nothing
to feel guilty about. This is my chance to implement the boundaries I’ve
learned, to enforce them when they’re trespassed so I don’t feel
enmeshed, to break old habits and reinforce new ones.

“This isn’t cool,” I tell her. “You can’t just come by without letting
me know.”

“But your phone number wasn’t working. How can you be so cold? You said
you loved me. It doesn’t just go away like that.”

She has a good point. I flash back to Lorraine’s words: You won’t get
hurt playing with toys, but they will. “I have a lot of love for you,” I
tell her. “But the relationship just”—I don’t know how to best put
it—“is over. It ended exactly when it should have.”

8. ASK YOURSELF THROUGHOUT THE DAY, “WHAT DO I NEED TO DO IN THIS MOMENT
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF?” IF YOU CAN BE AWARE OF WHAT LEGITIMATE NEEDS
AND WANTS YOU’RE NOT ATTENDING TO, AND THEN TAKE ACTIONS TO MEET THEM ON
YOUR OWN—OR ASK YOUR PARTNER FOR HELP IF YOU CAN’T—THAT IS THE ROAD TO
HAPPINESS.

“Is there someone else?” she asks.

“There is. But she won’t talk to me.”

“Is this a joke? You’re crazy.”

“I used to be crazy,” I tell her. “I think I’m finally getting sane.”

“Can I at least sleep here?” She takes a step closer and I inhale her
unique blend of pomade, sex, and moisturizer.

9. NO ONE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL ANYTHING AND YOU DON’T MAKE ANYONE FEEL A
CERTAIN WAY. SO DON’T TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR PARTNER’S FEELINGS
AND DON’T BLAME YOUR PARTNER FOR YOURS. THE MOST CARING THING TO DO WHEN
THEY’RE UPSET IS SIMPLY TO ASK IF THEY WANT YOU TO LISTEN, TO GIVE
ADVICE, TO GIVE THEM SPACE, OR TO GIVE THEM LOVING TOUCH.

“What?” It’s amazing: Even when you set a boundary, people still want to
trample across it.

She says, “I have nowhere to stay. Can I at least stay in the spare
bedroom and we can talk when you’re ready?”

I remind myself . . .

She says, “I took a cab from the airport.”

. . . that Sage is not my mother and . . .

She says, “I promise I’ll leave after we talk.”

. . . I am not responsible for her happiness.

So I draw the boundary more firmly. “It’s not okay to stay here. I’m
sorry, but I made a commitment to myself and I need to honor it.”

10. LOVE, HONOR, AND AFFIRM YOURSELF. WHATEVER YOUR DECISIONS, ACTIONS,
FEELINGS, AND THOUGHTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAY BE AND WHATEVER OUTCOME
THEY MAY LEAD TO, IF YOU ARE HEALTHY, THEN THEY ARE ULTIMATELY HEALTHY.

The words register on her face and she starts to protest. The old me
would want to hug her, to say we can talk later, to let her crash here,
to promise that we can still be friends, to make any number of mistakes.
But now all that goes through my mind is a question: Is it in my highest
good?

And none of these is in my highest good. So I remain resolute like stone
and she melts into water.

The tears mix with her mascara, running black down her face. They are
not my problem. They are her problem. And she will get over it. Or she
won’t. But the most compassionate thing I can do is let her make her own
decision based on the truth. And the truth is that I love Ingrid.

I just hope that Ingrid loves me.

11. AND, ABOVE ALL, ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BREATHE AND BE IN THE MOMENT.

But I will accept it if she doesn’t.

15

I stand outside the unheated garage where Ingrid’s stepdad made her live
with nothing but an old torn-out car seat as furniture while her brother
and stepbrothers lay on warm beds in warm rooms. I make sure my jacket
sits firmly on my shoulders, my purple shirt cuffs jut ever so slightly
out of the sleeves, my matching tie is just a touch off-center, and the
bottoms of my pants hang neatly over my shoes. I am Sage. I’ve come
begging.

I walk through the kitchen, where Ingrid’s stepfather made her cook and
scrub for hours every day, punishing her if she dared to sit down. She
was allowed to eat only after the rest of the family finished their
meal. At the end of the kitchen, there’s a door to the backyard, where
Ingrid’s stepfather would force her to chop the heads off chickens and
would laugh as she vomited at the horror of the act. She is my
Cinderella.

And hopefully in her fairy tale, I am the frog she has kissed and
transformed into a prince.

I look around for her, the box I wrapped last night in my arms. There
are two long tables decorated with flowers, surrounded by women in red
dresses and men in dark suits. Four of those men are her stepbrothers. I
hope Ingrid’s been telling them nice things about me. But somehow I
doubt it.

I circle the yard looking for Ingrid, hopeful not to see James Dean and
careful not to make eye contact with any of her stepbrothers. But she’s
nowhere to be found. I don’t belong here. I should leave.

“Hey, brother,” I hear a voice saying.

I turn around and see Hans near the bar, waiting for the ceremony to
begin. I congratulate him and thank him for inviting me. I want to ask
why he sent me the invitation, but I’m afraid he’s going to say it was
an accident.

His hand presses against the small of his back and he stretches as if in
pain. When I ask if he’s okay, he looks around furtively, making sure no
one else can overhear. Then he tells me he went to a strip club with his
friends for a surprise bachelor party the night before. He got so drunk
that he started dancing on the pole and carrying two strippers across
the stage. But he fell, dropped the dancers, and threw out his back.

“Don’t tell my bride,” he cautions.

“She doesn’t know?”

He smiles at me conspiratorially. “I told her I hurt it at work.”

And so another marriage is born with a lie. It is the great lie—that
husbands and wives have no sexual interest in anyone except each other.
I know deep down that I haven’t conquered my desire for other women—I
don’t think that’s possible without getting Hasse Walum to lower my
testosterone levels—but I’ve removed what was psychological: the fear of
loving, the terror of being loved, the compulsion to cheat, the
cowardice of lying, the weak sense of self, the pathological
accommodation, and all the defense mechanisms that kept this system in
place and me too blind to see it.

I want to ask Hans where Ingrid is, if she knows I’m coming, and if
she’s excited or angry or nervous or just doesn’t care. But this is his
day, his passage into a new life, so I leave him to prepare for it.

That’s when I see their mother, who gave up a television career in
Mexico to become a housewife in the United States. She sacrificed
everything to get away from the cheating first husband who tried to
murder her. But his replacement rarely lets her leave the house, have
any friends, do anything but chores, or even be a mother to Ingrid and
Hans. She is trapped not in the past, but in a fear her future will
replicate her past. So in the end, perhaps her ex-husband did kill her.
She lives in a coffin in Sylmar. Its headstone reads: Security.

Yet even she cheats, though she doesn’t see it as such. Sometimes she
tells her husband that she’s going to see a neighbor, but instead sneaks
out to see Ingrid and Hans, the children she had with her first husband.
Jealousy is an unforgiving adversary, still controlling the border long
after it has won the war.

I am back in the reality of relationships, where partners “bend the
rules” and tell “little white lies” to get their needs met. The ideal
I’ve been striving for is not the way people have relationships in the
real world. Perhaps, as I promised my friends in rehab, I actually have
gone out and designed a new type of relationship. Yet not one in which I
get to fuck all the women I want, as I’d hoped, but one in which I live
in truth and without fear or guilt.

I think about how I snuck out on Ingrid so long ago, telling her I was
going to Marilyn Manson’s house the night before our trip to Chicago,
the night before her birthday. And I feel disgust with myself for ever
having done that. I used to think I was a good person, but how could a
good person do something so reprehensible?

The answer: compartmentalization. The act of putting shameful activities
in a small sealed box in our brain, where they remain safely hidden,
even from our own intelligence and conscience.

I hope her mom’s not upset I’m here. “Congratulations,” I tell her
slowly. She doesn’t speak English—her current husband never let her take
lessons—though she understands basic words. “You must be very proud of
Hans.”

She smiles with a delicacy that reminds me of Ingrid and then says
softly, “She needs you.”

They are the only English words I’ve ever heard her speak. I stand
before her stupidly for a moment, fighting down the surge of emotion.
“We need each other,” I sputter.

She nods wisely and kindly at me, as only a mother can, a mother who
sees something that her children are too inexperienced to recognize.

And that’s when I spot her, emerging from the back porch of the house,
all white and all blond—a color combination shared by no one else at the
wedding. She is pale like a ghost but radiant like a goddess. She’s not
just more beautiful than I remember, she’s more exquisite, commanding,
otherworldly.

It’s too far away to see the expression on her face as she steps into
the darkness between the back stairs and the party. Hercules follows
obediently, wearing a red bow tie. I break into a wide smile and hope to
see it reflected back in her face. As she comes closer, I don’t detect
anger or fear or disappointment or disgust or any of the emotions I was
afraid she’d have. She too is smiling.

I’ve been so stupid.

This is the one, I tell myself. This is the woman I’m going to marry.

I just hope I’ve truly changed.

Excerpt from Ingrid’s Mind

And there he walks through the crowd of a Mexican fiesta. I recognize
his shirt and tie. They’re the same ones he’s worn at almost every book
signing since I’ve known him. Purple shirt and purple tie hugging his
body.

I quickly run into the house and bypass my aunt, who’s waiting for the
bathroom. As soon as the door opens, I stumble in, pushing everyone out
of the way so I can look at myself one last time before he sees me.

I check my hair, reclip my extensions, fix my push-up bra, and debate
whether to use my pink lipstick or keep the red. Red screams, “Take me,
you fool, and kiss me passionately.” And pink says, “These lips are
delicate and soft, handle with care.”

So I choose the red. I leave the bathroom and walk through the kitchen.
But when I see my reflection in the stainless-steel refrigerator door, I
quickly grab a napkin and rub off the red lipstick. Then I put on the
pink, and now it’s a mess and my lips say, “Take fool kiss delicate
handle.”

The last year was hard for me. When Neil and I broke up, I felt like
everything I had was taken from me. I was angry and disappointed because
I gave and gave and gave, and then I was left with nothing. I felt
disconnected from the world. There was an emptiness in my chest. I kept
trying to figure out what was wrong with me that would cause him to do
that.

I dated a lot to forget the feeling. I rebounded with a
bartender/underwear model. But one day after we had sex, he pretended
like he was a gorilla, flaring his nostrils and pounding his chest while
naked for an uncomfortably long period of time. I grabbed my clothes,
left politely, and never saw him again.

After that, I met a sweet guy who wrote speeches for presidents. I just
wanted to have fun and not feel the pain, but he wanted more from me
than I was ready to give. So I broke up with him, then started dating a
magician I met at the Magic Castle. When I split up with him, I realized
that maybe the relationship I needed to be in was with myself.

When Neil texted me from Machu Picchu, I wanted to run back into his
arms. But I was scared I’d be cheated on again. And I wasn’t ready. I’d
just broken up with everyone and felt too vulnerable.

Being alone was the best thing I ever did for myself. I’ve always gone
from one relationship to another, hoping the other person would help me
figure out who I was or complete me and make me feel whole. But it never
worked out that way. When the other person didn’t make me feel whole, I
was left with an even bigger emptiness inside. It took the pain of the
last year to realize that I needed to stop being a half trying to find
my other half, but to be a whole on my own. I had to learn how to love
myself. I had to learn to value myself. And I had to learn that I
mattered.

I’m not sure if I’m whole yet, but I’m more complete. And so when Hans
asked for help thinking of wedding guests, I suggested Neil. I told Neil
that if he ever texted me “freeeeeeedom,” I would be there. I didn’t say
when. I had to be ready, too. And so I made and sent him the invitation
myself. I wanted to see him one more time, just to be sure I wasn’t
making a mistake and walking away from the love of my life.

Before leaving the kitchen, I stand behind the window and try to catch
one last glimpse of Neil before our eyes meet. My hands are sweating and
I feel a burst of anxiety. There’s still time for me to call a taxi and
leave. Or run through the front door and climb up my favorite tree,
where I used to hide from my stepdad as a kid.

I’m worried that this is a mistake. As my grandmother used to say: You
can’t change a person unless they’re in diapers.

Though another one of her favorite sayings is: With patience, even the
grass becomes milk.

Being with Neil felt like having the most beautiful bird from the
Amazon, full of colors and life but kept in a cage that was too small
for his wings to spread. I’d sit next to the cage every morning and sing
with him, but he was always looking out the window. I told him when we
separated that it was time to open the cage and set the bird free. But
every morning afterward, I looked through the window and hoped to catch
a glimpse of him flying by.

So now here I am, looking through the kitchen window and into the yard,
and I see Neil flying outside. I see his tender eyes and his sweet
smile. He touches his face just below his left eye with his index and
middle finger, rubbing back and forth. And as I smile at the memory of
that nervous tic of his, I open the screen door and step outside to fly
with him.

I just hope he’s changed.

_T_he Survivor sits on my window ledge, brilliantly green and thriving.

Beneath it, Ingrid and I sit on a couch that’s been cleaned obsessively,
removing all DNA traces of communes, triads, and open relationships.
Hercules is sprawled on the floor next to a beautiful white Maltese dog
that Ingrid also rescued.

On the table, there’s a box wrapped in silver paper. I undress it, slit
the packing tape with a pen, and open the cardboard flaps.

There are five small wrapped presents inside, each marked with a
different number. A scroll of burnt parchment lies on top of them.

“Go ahead, read it,” Ingrid urges.

                _Ladies and Gentlemen,_

                _You are cordially invited to the funeral of our
greatest and biggest room fixture, Jacob “The Elephant” Goff, age 3, of
Malibu, California._

                _A celebration of life service will be held today at 9
P.M. in the community where he lived uninvited. Mr. Goff the Elephant
will be buried with some of his most precious items._

                _Sincerely,_

                _Messrs. Freedom & Trust Mortuary_

At first, I don’t understand. Why are we burying an elephant?

She places her hand warmly over mine. “You worked hard to win back my
trust, so I’ve been working hard to forgive.”

It’s the elephant in the room—my past cheating, sneakiness, and lying.
And just as I gave Ingrid a present at her brother’s wedding to prove
that I’ve changed, the five individually wrapped boxes in front of me
three months later are her way of saying that so too has she.

Though Disney cartoons and romance movies end the moment the lovers
reunite, leaving the audience to assume they lived happily ever after,
in real life this is the moment the story truly begins.

It’s when Sleeping Beauty asks Prince Phillip, “How many princesses did
you kiss while I was asleep?”

It’s when the Little Mermaid yells at Prince Eric, “An enchantment
spell? That’s the worst excuse I’ve ever heard. You were about to marry
that other girl!”

It’s when the princess who kissed the frog asks the resultant prince,
“Be honest: While you were a frog, did you have sex with any female
frogs?”

Without the intensity to keep them busy, the common enemy to unite them,
or the obstacles to intensify their longing, these legendary lovers now
face the biggest challenge of all: dealing with each other—and the
differences, be they great or slight, in their values, upbringings,
opinions, personalities, expectations, preferences, and imperfections.
Especially when the aftermath of every such adventure is trauma.

And so, as one might expect, Ingrid did not freely give me her trust
after we reunited. On our first day back together, she threatened to
leave if I didn’t change my social networking status to reflect that I’m
in a relationship—even though I no longer have access to the account. On
the second day, she threatened to leave after seeing photos of Sage on
my computer. On the third day, she threatened to leave if I didn’t let
her look through my phone. And on the fourth, she said that the memories
of the past were too painful for her to want to date me again.

That’s when I realized that as a love avoidant, I’d placed Ingrid on a
pedestal, thinking that because she was so attached and I wasn’t, she
must somehow be better at love than I. But in reality she was just
sitting on the other end of the same dysfunctional seesaw. After all,
she has at least one fatal flaw we both agree on: She chose me as I was
back then.

“I never saw it before, but I definitely have a pattern, too,” she
realized when we discussed this. “My boyfriend before you was totally
enmeshed by his mother. She’d call all the time, asking him to do things
for her, and he’d drop everything to take care of her. I stayed with him
for five years, even though he never let me use the word _boyfriend_ or
say we were dating or even see him more than twice a week.”

And so I found a former colleague of Lorraine’s named Vince, zipped up
my wetsuit, and watched as he put Ingrid in the chair and began the
process of healing the father-abandonment wounds that led to her love
addiction.

As she sat yelling at her father, tears streaming down her face, I
realized that we had the exact same parents: enmeshing moms and
abandoning dads. Except where my mother wants my father dead, her father
actually tried to kill her mother.

It’s odd how relationships work like that: Love is not an accident. It
is a delicate union of two complex, complementary puzzle pieces that
have inadvertently been created by different manufacturers.

I was told, “When it’s love at first sight, run in the other direction.”
And I tried that. But I ran right back into her. And now as we sit side
by side, starting down a new path together, I unwrap the gift marked #1.
Inside, there’s a small wooden coffin lined with white satin. Ingrid’s
handwritten instructions say to leave it open.

The second gift is a small, gray plastic elephant. The note with it
reads: “This is the Elephant in the room. He will no longer be in the
room with us, because he will be resting in his coffin. The fear, doubt,
and anger he created will no longer hurt us or be intrusive to the love
we have for each other. I love you.”

My face swells as I place the elephant in the coffin on its side. It
fits snugly, its feet and trunk close to the edges.

The next package contains two small metal birdcages, each with tiny
metal birds in them. “The Cages symbolize being restrained, unable to
speak your mind, misunderstood, and alienated,” Ingrid’s note explains.
“These two beautiful Birds placed inside cages with nowhere to go, left
alone and lonely, symbolize us as children, as teenagers, and as adults.
We are burying this because we are no longer alone or lonely. We have
the freedom to fly anywhere we want.”

Awed by her wisdom, thoughtfulness, and creativity, I place the two
caged birds in the coffin: one at the elephant’s head and the other at
its rear.

In such a short amount of time and with much less struggle, Ingrid is
already on this journey with me. And together we are learning that, to
paraphrase the relationship writer Harville Hendrix, the unconscious
purpose of a long-term relationship is to finish childhood. Or, as
psychiatrist Eric Berne puts it even more succinctly, “Love is nature’s
psychotherapy.”

The next gift contains a dozen miniature metal hands. “The Hands
symbolize judging, lack of boundaries, and control. This is how we felt
as children and sometimes as adults. Today we are burying this and
letting go of the people who pointed fingers at us, the people who tried
to control us, our own lack of boundaries, and our attempts to control
each other.”

I sprinkle the hands over the elephant, the cages, the coffin floor.

The fifth package contains two metal keys with words on them: Secrets
and Memories. “These are the Bad Keys,” her parchment explains. “The
Secrets Key means we no longer have to keep secrets for anyone who ever
hurt us. When this key is buried, we will let go of the secrets that are
hurting us inside and no longer take on responsibility for other
people’s problems. The Memories Key is for our bad memories. We are
letting go of our attachment to them. We will no longer keep these
memories locked up inside and allow them to rule us.”

As I slide the keys around the elephant, I finally understand what the
true intimacy that Joan spoke about in rehab actually is: It’s when
partners stop living in the past—in their trauma history—and start
having a relationship with each other in the present moment. Love, it
turns out, is not something to be learned. It’s something we already
have, and we must unlearn in order to access it.

Her instructions then read: “Take a moment or two before closing the
coffin. You will not be able to open it once it is closed, so take
pictures and do whatever you want for the next few minutes or hours. But
close it before the day is over.”

I stare at the coffin and the beautiful, carefully thought-out items
inside. I look at the little elephant, the trapped birds, the many
hands, and, finally, the keys, until a single word in the coffin fills
my vision: _secrets_.

And I think that if I truly want the past buried, now is the time to set
free any last secrets. The moment is so perfect, but like everything
perfect, it is fragile.

I tell her nervously, awkwardly, slowly: “I want you to know that there
was other bad stuff in the past besides Juliet”—the woman I cheated
with. “I didn’t know then that I couldn’t still love you and sneak
around behind your back. I didn’t understand. But I understand now.”

As she takes this in, her face freezes and her spine stiffens, like a
cat reacting to a sudden noise. I look at the Secrets Key and think of
what else I’m holding back. “I know you dated some people while we were
apart, and I just want to let you know that besides some of the stuff
we’ve already discussed, I had a lot of other experiences.”

“What kind of experiences?” she asks warily.

The beautiful solemnity of the ritual is shattering. But this is what it
means to tell the truth: It is to give someone else her freedom, to
allow her to have a reaction even if it leads to negative consequences
for you, to give her the voice that lying takes away.

In the past, I’ve had a remarkable gift for turning even the most minor
manifestation of fear or disapproval from my partner into a personal
catastrophe. But instead, I use the four adjustments to turn shame into
reassurance.

Shame is about being bad for someone; reassurance is about being good to
yourself.

And not only does it make more sense to respond with compassion instead
of criticism, it’s also much easier on everyone involved. It may be the
key to a longer, happier life.

I tell Ingrid about the poly people, and learning the four adjustments
and the concept of relationships based on intents. I tell her about the
swingers, and learning that my sexual fantasies can add to a
relationship if I include my partner in them rather than trying to
protect her from them. I tell her about the harem house, and learning
that love is not a terrifying monster making unreasonable demands on my
life, but a beautiful friend making occasional requests that I have the
option to accept or deny. And I tell her about the open relationship,
and learning not just to let go of jealousy and control, but to explore
my painful emotions rather than avoiding them like an addict.

As Ingrid listens, she oscillates through a spectrum of feelings: anger,
fear, sadness, until, finally, she lands on love. “I never thought I’d
say this,” she sighs, sliding closer to me and stroking my head. “But
maybe all those things you did weren’t a relapse after all but were part
of the healing.”

“I’d like to think so.”

As Lorraine once put it, recovery is not about perpetually living in joy
and harmony, but about shortening the time it takes to return there when
you inevitably fuck it up. And for this reason, I’m grateful for the
opportunity that every conflict Ingrid and I have provides to practice
this.

“It’s just incredible how different you are now,” Ingrid says after I
share this with her. “You’re much more calm and mature and patient and
understanding. Sometimes I’m waiting for you to get upset or annoyed,
and it doesn’t come. It’s magical. You’re like a butterfly. You spun
your little cocoon and you transformed. Even your eyes are different. I
can see your heart through them.”

Most love stories are about two people who belong together, but are
blocked by an obstacle keeping them apart: their cultures, their social
standing, their families, a rival lover, a manipulating villain, an
unexpected tragedy. But in real life, love stories are more complex.
People want love, but after they get it, they become scared or bored or
uncertain or resentful. And when they get pain instead of love, they
don’t leave. They cling to it more strongly than they would to pleasure.
And so in life, the real obstacle keeping two lovers apart is not
external. The battle to be fought is within.

And so, I think as I take in Ingrid’s words, in the end, love is not
about finding the right person. It’s about becoming the right person.

I put my hand on the lid of the coffin. “This is it,” I tell her. “We’re
saying goodbye to the past. Is there anything else you want to know?”

“Let’s close it,” she says.

First, I take a photo:

[image]

And then I shut the lid.

The elephant in the room is gone.

“There’s one last package,” Ingrid says.

She hands me a palm-sized box that she’s kept separate from the rest of
the gifts. Inside are a note and four keys of various shapes and sizes,
each with a different word on it. “These are the Good Keys, the ones you
keep,” the note reads. “The Love Key is to remind you that you are
worthy of love and you always have access to my love. The Heart Key is
the key to the biggest heart on earth: yours. The Life Key is the key to
opening our lives for each other. And the Journey Key is for the path to
our happiness.”

While reading these beautiful words, I notice the complete absence of my
old feelings: suffocation from her love, doubt that I have a good heart,
fear of opening our lives to each other, and anxiety about her
expectations of me. Instead, every word rings like truth. Neither
haunted by the past nor worried about the future, I’m finally grateful
for the present.

It turns out that relationships don’t require sacrifices. They just
require growing up—and the ability to stop clinging to immature needs
that are so tenacious, they keep the mature needs from getting met.

I find some paracord in the kitchen, thread a length of it through the
key ring, and hang it around my neck so I can keep the keys close to my
heart.

“I trust you with these keys,” she says.

“I will be worthy of them this time.”

There’s one last instruction on the scroll: to bury the coffin. Unable
to find my shovel in the garage, I grab two large spoons from a kitchen
drawer instead.

In the backyard, on top of a hill so small it’s more of a bump, there’s
a soft patch of dirt surrounded by fragments of discarded slate. We
kneel around it and start scooping. The dirt is soft and yields easily.
We dig until the grave is ten inches deep, safe from being discovered by
the tree house’s next tenants. In olden days, this was supposedly a
Chumash burial ground.

We throw a spoonful of dirt over the coffin and she says a few words.
“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to bury Jacob ‘The Elephant’
Goff. He was a very loyal companion. He never left our sides. We wanted
to get rid of him, but he turned out to be the best thing that ever
happened to us. Without this elephant, we wouldn’t have each other. May
God have mercy on his soul.”

We fake-cry as we gather the dirt spooned around us and fill the hole,
until the elephant is gone and buried without a trace of its existence
left above ground.

Then we share a moment of silence, basking in the solace of letting go.
Ingrid speaks first: “Uh-oh, I accidentally buried my car keys.”

I laugh, squeeze her tightly to me, and kiss her between the sparkling,
mischievous eyes I so sorely missed.

“I love making you laugh,” she grins. “You have this amazing smile and
your cheeks fill up. I have this picture in my head of us as old people,
and me doing something to make you laugh.”

“I picture that too.” And if I had the choice between laughing or having
different foursomes for the rest of my life, I’d take the laughing every
time.

“I kind of want to call Juliet and tell her, ‘Thanks for everything,’”
Ingrid says as we walk back to the house.

As I take her hand in mine, I realize that before trauma healing, I
always wanted more—more women, more success, more money, more space,
more experience, more possessions. Not once did I stop and say, as I do
now, “I have enough.”

_W_e drive in silence. My father and I. It is my last day as a single
man.

I wait for him to give me advice, to say something about my impending
wedding, to offer anything he’s learned from fifty years of marriage.
But he says nothing. I suppose I shouldn’t have expected anything
different: He never told me about the birds and the bees until I was
twenty-two, and his advice was, “Take your time. Go slow. And don’t rush
it.”

To break the silence, I ask what his father was like.

“He was very quiet and didn’t say much. He usually worked all the time.”

“What’s your favorite memory of him?”

“I guess it was when we were fishing together one day, just in silence.”

I think about how lonely that must have been, and I suppose, in
correlation, how lonely I was. “What about your mom? What’s your
favorite memory of her?”

He struggles to remember something about his mother, who was a busy
Chicago socialite. “I guess I don’t have any strong memories of her,
either positive or negative.”

In my enmeshing conversations of old, we would discuss the theory that
because Dad’s mother was self-absorbed and his sister was the family
favorite, his self-esteem was so low and his fear of women so great that
he felt as if the only people he could have power over were the
helpless—the handicapped. Clearly, on some level, my foray into the
world of seduction—to get what I believed was a psychological advantage
over women—was my own attempt to do the same.

“I did have a live-in babysitter, though,” he adds, “and I guess we were
closer.”

I’m surprised to hear how similar our childhoods were—with a distant
father, narcissistic mother, favored sibling, and babysitter raising us.
And I think about how similar our adult lives almost were.

My relatives often tell the story of a family portrait I drew in
kindergarten. Sketched in crayon on construction paper, there are stick
figures representing myself, my little brother, our babysitter, and each
of my parents. Then there’s a large red line that begins in the center
of my father’s legs, drops straight to the ground, and finally stretches
out in a wide circle around the family. It is my father’s penis. Even
back then, I somehow knew that our entire family was subordinate to its
influence, living in the shadow of its enormity.

And so there is one question that’s burning my insides. I work up the
guts to ask my father and get some closure on the subject after more
than two decades.

“So how did you become obsessed with people with physical disabilities?”

That’s what I want to ask, but I don’t. Whatever his answer may be, it’s
a discussion his wife should be having with him, not me. The part of it
that concerns me—growing up around a marriage rotted by it—is over with.

I reflect on something Ingrid told me the day I knelt in the sand on a
deserted beach in Kauai and asked her to marry me. “You didn’t come from
a loving family. I didn’t come from a loving family. But now we have a
chance to make a loving family together.”

My father and I lapse back into silence. We haven’t quite bonded. I
don’t know if that’s even possible. I can’t recall him ever being
comfortable with emotional intimacy or physical affection. Trying to
bash my head through his wall will only result in brain damage. But at
least I’ve knocked on his door for the first time to see if he wants to
let anyone in.

Lately, I’ve started thinking of the things my parents didn’t do
perfectly as _variables_ that make me an individual rather than as
_trauma_ that makes me a patient. It’s not healthy to walk through life
identifying oneself as a victim and others as perpetrators.

“Your mother wants to talk to you,” my dad says when we return to the
beach house Ingrid and I are renting for the wedding.

She sits in an armchair, with her feet up and a cane at her side. “Is
there going to be a photographer at the wedding?” she asks.

“Of course.”

Her face tilts to disapproval. “Did you tell him not to take any photos
of me?”

“I did.” This is the only request of hers I honor. Since she found out
about my dad’s fetish, she hasn’t allowed anyone to take a single photo
of her.

“I used to think I was so beautiful,” she sighs. “But now I just feel
like a freak.”

In rehab, I told my group how I used to try to convince her otherwise,
to tell her that if she were blond and Dad had a fetish for blondes,
she’d be completely fine with it. But this time, I let the comment pass
unnoticed, as she herself wants to be. And I accept the fact that she is
too old to change. One day soon, she won’t be here anymore.

In the notes about love that I compiled during anhedonia, one of the
most important was not to date someone hoping she’ll change. So perhaps
I can apply the lesson to my relationship with her also and accept her
as the person she is, not the one I’d like her to be, and be grateful
that she loved me as much as she knew how.

“Thanks so much,” I tell Rick when he visits on the morning of the
wedding. “You made this possible.”

“I don’t want any of the blame!”

“Any blame would be on me.”

“On this we agree.”

We walk outside to the patio and sit on deck chairs facing seaward. “At
one point, I was ready to give up and stop discussing all this with
you,” he says, looking over the ocean to the horizon. “It’s tragic. The
wounds that humans get are so strong that they’re like robots operating
on childhood programming. And even if they learn the truth about
themselves in therapy and rehab, they still cling to their false beliefs
and make choices that don’t serve them—over and over again.” He shakes
his head at the cosmic absurdity of it all. “It takes hard, conscious,
diligent work to genuinely change.”

I have a feeling it’s the closest thing to a wedding congratulations I’m
going to get from Rick, so I accept it as such. The reception, Ingrid
and I agreed, should be small, so that we actually have time and energy
to pay attention to each other. I’ve invited only the people who made it
possible: my immediate family, Rick, the red demons, close friends like
Melanie, and a few dating coaches and relationship healers. The former
gave me the tools to meet Ingrid, the latter to commit to her.

However, Lorraine, to whom I owe more thanks than anyone, never RSVP’d
to the invitation. I made some calls to find out what happened to her.
From what I could gather, she was disciplined for having what’s known as
a _dual relationship_ with clients (both social and therapeutic). So now
she’s in a more administrative role at the hospital, and—not unlike
Adam—she’s too scared to leave and spread her wings on her own. Yet I
hope that one day I’ll be able to speak with her again and thank her for
saving my life—just as she has saved the lives of countless others.

Beyond showering, shaving, and putting on a tuxedo, there’s not much for
me to do to prepare for the wedding. So in the afternoon, Adam, Calvin,
and Troy come by the house and we change into swimsuits.

“How are you doing with the whole monogamy thing?” Troy asks as we walk
down the hillside to the beach together.

“You know, I think I blew it up into too big a deal. I hate to say this,
but Joan was right: I was just throwing intellectual barriers in my way
to avoid being vulnerable and committed.” In a big, connected world,
it’s easy to find enough people with the same trauma profile to agree
with you, then simply discount, ignore, or attack all evidence to the
contrary.

“But what about the male dilemma—the whole ‘sex gets old and so does
she’ thing?” Troy asks. And I’m embarrassed for ever having thought of
anything so shallow and misguided.

“I think that’s only true if two people see each other as objects or
employees. If they’re emotionally healthy adults, then there’s no
dilemma that they can’t work out together. They’re not going to even
notice each other aging but just getting happier.” I pause to reflect on
it. What I saw as getting old before wasn’t truly a fear of physical
decline but a fear of becoming unhappy like my parents. And I’m
definitely not worried about that anymore. “Growing older and happier
with Ingrid is one of the things I’m most looking forward to in life
right now.”

A strange thing happened: As I dealt with my enmeshment issues, I became
less concerned about wanting sex outside the relationship. And as Ingrid
dealt with her abandonment issues, she became less concerned about
losing me if I happen to feel attraction to another woman. In fact, once
she saw that I was completely happy and fully satisfied to be
exclusively with her, anything became possible.

As a result, we developed the relationship I’d been looking for the
whole time, only I didn’t know what it was: a relationship without fear.
Without fear of intimacy, without fear of suffocation, without fear of
loss, without fear of speaking our truth, without fear of being hurt,
without fear of boredom, without fear of change, without fear of the
future, without fear of conflict, and even without fear of other people.

The opposite of fear is not joy. It is acceptance. And that is what
we’ve replaced the fear with. So our commitment today is to neither
monogamy nor nonmonogamy. Those are other people’s values and
dichotomies. Our commitment is solely to nurturing, supporting, and
honoring three important entities in our lives: me, her, and the
relationship. Whatever it takes and however we may change.

Call it a non-dualistic relationship.

“How are you handling all the temptation?” Calvin asks. His eyes direct
my gaze to a woman with long black hair, pink headphones, and a
zebra-striped bikini jogging past.

“I still get tempted, but I just decide to wait a little while before
opening any doors or doing anything stupid. Soon the temptation goes
away, and I realize the trust I have with Ingrid—and where that can
go—is much more powerful than a few moments of pleasure, followed by a
lifetime of shame.”

I’ve come to realize that there’s no so-called _natural_ way to be in a
relationship. The whole idea that we can study the past or other
cultures to determine what’s right for us today is ridiculous. Because
nearly every society of simians tells a different story of mating and
sexuality—and every point of view can be supported with evidence from
some other tribe or species. There isn’t just one true and proper way to
love, to relate, to bond, to touch. Any style of relationship is the
right one, as long as it’s a decision made by the whole person and not
the hole in the person.

The path of ambivalence leads nowhere.

“So what would you do if the most beautiful woman in the world hit on
you right now?” Troy asks.

“And what about porn?” Calvin adds.

“Or what if Ingrid loses interest in sex altogether?” Adam tries.

It’s interesting: All these issues that were so important and perplexing
in rehab don’t actually matter anymore. The answer to all of them is,
They’re the wrong questions. “Here’s what I’m doing,” I explain. “I’m
honest about everything and so is she. There are no secrets. So we’d
just discuss those things, like we should have in the first place. In
fact, the exact things I used to be the most scared to talk about
actually brought us closer together once we got past the initial
awkwardness. It was the _not knowing_ that was driving her the most
crazy. Eventually she felt safe enough to share her deepest fantasies,
and it turned out that some of them weren’t all that different from mine
anyway.”

The beach ends at a cliff that marks the northern tip of Point Dume.
Just around the cliff is a wide, empty beach, and I ask the guys if they
want to swim around to the other side.

“I don’t want you to die on your wedding day,” Adam replies, and seems
to mean it.

We take off our shirts and wade into the water in a safer spot. The
waves crash ten yards out from the shore and we playfully tumble with
them to the sand a few times.

“How are things with your wife?” I ask Adam as we sit on the shore
afterward, drying off in the sun.

“She finally started having sex with me again,” he says.

“No way. So was it worth the wait?”

“I’ll tell you, Neil, it really wasn’t. On a scale of one to ten, it’s a
three at best.” Troy laughs cruelly. So many men like Adam complain that
their wives won’t have sex with them, yet so few of them would be
satisfied if their wives did. Because the problem isn’t actually the
sex; it’s the relationship between the people having it.

“You should watch instructional videos together,” Calvin suggests. “Or
get her really drunk.”

“That’s okay. I really can’t change my wife. She is who she is, and I
have to start thinking about what’s next.”

“Wow, really?” I exclaim.

“You know,” he says, burying his feet in the sand, “recently I had to
wear a Holter monitor because my heart started randomly
fluttering—sometimes for five minutes straight. So either I leave this
marriage or I have a good risk of a heart attack.”

“So which are you going to choose?”

“I’ve rehearsed the conversation I’m going to have with the kids, but I
want to wait until our youngest is out of the house in two years and
then do it.”

“Two years?” Calvin interjects. “You could be dead by then! What’s wrong
with you?”

“What about you, Calvin?” Troy rises to Adam’s defense. “As soon as you
develop feelings for someone, you can’t even have sex with them. What
are you doing about that?”

“More than you’re doing about your affair.”

I listen as Calvin says that he wants to find his soulmate and Adam says
that he truly is ready to move on and Troy says that the modern human
isn’t designed for lifelong monogamy. Their voices mingle with the sea,
blurring, blending, and ringing like music.

As we walk back up to the house so I can change into my tuxedo, I get
the feeling that this is the last meeting of the red demons. It takes
commitment to change. For only in commitment is there freedom. And it is
time, finally, to commit.

Check-in: the only emotion on the list of eight that I never checked in
with at rehab . . . love.

Special Note to Ingrid

I hope you ignored the message at the beginning of the book and read
everything. I wrote that years ago, when I started working on this, when
I knew so little about love, sex, relationships, and intimacy. But I
want you to know the real me. After all, you’re stuck with me for a long
time. No matter what Helen Fisher says.

GRATITUDE

There are times when I’m in the bathroom with Ingrid getting ready for
the day, and I’m so happy I get what we’ve come to call an ROL—a _rush
of love_. In those moments, I think about how Rick tried to convince me
I was missing out on a bigger happiness and how cynical I was about it.
I had no way of understanding what he meant until I experienced it for
myself. And now, not a day goes by that I’m not grateful.

So I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart (now that I know I
have one) everyone who made it possible. And for those who want to use
this experience as a starting point for your own explorations, here are
a few first steps you can take as you find your unique path. Note that I
don’t agree with all of the recommendations of these experts, so feel
free to cherry-pick whichever are most useful to you.

Many of the concepts can be found in the works of Pia Mellody, James
Hollis, Virginia Satir, John Bradshaw, Kenneth Adams, Marshall
Rosenberg, Marion Solomon, Harville Hendrix, Salvador Minuchin, Peter
Levine, Bessel van der Kolk, Robert Firestone, and others. I also
recommend taking Patrick Carnes’s Post-Traumatic Stress Index test
online to understand the ways your past haunts your behavior today. (Use
the original PTSI test, not the revised PTSI-R.) And you may want to
email Barbara McNally (the one in Venice, CA) and urge her to publish
her own book, because her teachings and wisdom were a big influence as
well.

If you want to go deeper, choose your practitioners carefully. So much
of what passes for therapy is an expensive, endless series of weekly
appointments progressing not toward healing but toward income security
or ego gratification for the therapist. If you’re lucky, you’ll find
someone like Lorraine to be a kind of primary-care therapist who will
develop a treatment plan designed to heal a particular core issue—one
that includes other practitioners and methods. And remember that once
the change begins, psychological maintenance, self-correction tools, and
consistent self-care are necessary to keep from backsliding.

Note that there is probably no therapist who would read this book and
agree with everything in it. I have selected and conveyed various ideas
in an immense canon of work with only one goal in mind: to share the
ways in which they spoke to and influenced me. My adaptations,
adjustments, and interpretations of these concepts do not necessarily
have any relation to the way they were originally written or intended.
They are simply what I needed to believe to get right with myself.

Though there are countless competing theories, classification systems,
and schools of thought dedicated to understanding and treating the human
mind—many claiming that they are newer, better, or more scientific than
others—all that ultimately matters is what works for you. So be
open-minded and try everything for yourself firsthand rather than
accepting received opinions, including mine.

I’m currently keeping an open and expanding list of recommended
websites, workshops, and practitioners at www.neilstrauss.com/thetruth.
I also have a detailed reading list there, as well as information on
trauma-healing workshops that offer scholarships for those who don’t
have book advances to spend. And although I’ve tried to obfuscate the
details for most rehab centers, meetings, and therapists in order to
protect the privacy of the patients, addicts, and certain practitioners
I met, if you reach out to neil@neilstrauss.com, someone will be happy
to point you in the right direction. (I’ve slowly removed the phone and
Internet restrictions created during anhedonia, but I still try to stay
offline.)

If you’re interested in finding your own relationship species and want
to avoid making the mistakes I did in these pages, heal yourself
_before_ exploring different styles. You’re likely to fare a lot better.
If you’re healthy, whatever type of relationship you choose will also be
healthy. Be aware, however, that the underground scenes change
quickly—for example, the Bliss parties aren’t what they used to be—so do
some independent research before plunging in. In an early draft of this
book, when I thought it was going in another direction, I put together
an appendix of all the different relationship styles I could find, and
you can grab that at www.neilstrauss.com/goodtimes.

There are many people who helped read, critique, fact-check, or
otherwise opine during the years it took to write this book. The
following are just a few of them: Rico Rivera, Tim Ferriss, Ryan Soave,
Michelle Piper, Christopher Ryan, Chris Collins, Jaiya, Rodrigo
Umpierrez, Molly Lindley, Suzanne Noguere, Andrea Dinsmore, Nola Singer,
Jackie Singer, Brian Fishbach, Sy Rhys Kaye, Jared Leto, Paul Hughes,
Judith Regan, Michael Wharton, Steven Kotler, Jim Galyan, Chelsey
Goodan, John Mills, Alexander Hoyt-Heydon, Jack Sadanowicz, Chris Hurn,
Brad Rentfrow, Billy O’Donnell, Aaron Werth, Victor Cheng, Kira Coplin,
Elizabeth Hill, Lucy Brown, Christina Swing, Thann Clark, Anthony
Miller, Jay Stinnett & the Mago staff, The Society, Mary Ellen Junkins,
and the late and great Eleanor Starlin.

Special kudos to Ben Smolen and to the razor-sharp Phoebe Parros for
research. And to design collaborators new, the clairvoyant Laurie
Griffin, and old, the wizardly Bernard Chang. Finally, of course, a
massive thank-you to my extended family at HarperCollins, particularly
my longtime and ~~mostly~~ extremely patient editor Calvert Morgan and
my new publisher, Lynn Grady.

Everyone else I’d like to acknowledge is already in the book. I’d
especially like to thank them for putting up with me as I drove them
nuts during this process of growing up.

And, finally, I’d like to welcome Tenn Strauss to the world. As I write
this, he is three weeks away from being born. Last night, I wrote him a
letter, letting him know that no matter what may happen over the course
of his life, he was conceived and brought into this world with pure love
and absolute joy.

I hope he grows up to make someone as happy as his mom makes me.
