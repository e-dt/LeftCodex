ACKNOWLEDGMENT{.font8
style="font-weight:bold;"}

Ricki Abrams and I began writing this book together in Amsterdam,
Holland, in December 1971. We worked long and hard and through a lot of
living and then, for many reasons, our paths separated. Ricki went to
Australia, then to India. I returned to Amerika. So the book, in its
early pieces and fragments, became mine as the responsibility for
finishing it became mine. I thank Ricki here for the work we did
together, and the time we had together, and this book which came from
that time and grew beyond it.

INTRODUCTION{.font8
style="font-weight:bold;"}

This book is an action, a political action where revolution is the
goal. It has no other purpose. It is not cerebral wisdom, or academic
horseshit, or ideas carved in granite or destined for immortality. It is
part of a process and its context is change. It is part of a planetary
movement to restructure community forms and human consciousness so that
people have power over their own lives, participate fully in community,
live in dignity and freedom.

The commitment to ending male dominance as the fundamental
psychological, political, and cultural reality of earth-lived life is
the fundamental revolutionary commitment. It is a commitment to
transformation of the self and transformation of the social reality on
every level. The core of this book is an analysis of sexism (that system
of male dominance), what it is, how it operates on us and in us.
However, I do want to discuss briefly two problems, tangential to that
analysis, but still crucial to the development of revolutionary program
and consciousness. The first is the nature of the women's movement as
such, and the second has to do with the work of the writer.

Until the appearance of the brilliant anthology Sisterhood
Is Powerful
Sexual Politics, women did not think of themselves as
oppressed people. Most women, it must be admitted, still do not. But the
women's movement as a radical liberation movement in Amerika can be
dated from the appearance of those two books. We learn as we reclaim our
herstory that there was a feminist movement which organized around the
attainment of the vote for women. We learn that those feminists were
also ardent abolitionists. Women "came out" as abolitionists ---out of
the closets, kitchens, and bedrooms; into public meetings, newspapers,
and the streets. Two activist heroes of the abolitionist movement were
Black women, Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman, and they stand as
prototypal revolutionary models.

Those early Amerikan feminists thought that suffrage was the key to
participation in Amerikan democracy and that, free and enfranchised, the
former slaves would in fact be free and enfranchised. Those women did
not imagine that the vote would be effectively denied Blacks through
literacy tests, property qualifications, and vigilante police action by
white racists. Nor did they imagine the "separate but equal" doctrine
and the uses to which it would be put.

Feminism and the struggle for Black liberation were parts of a
compelling whole. That whole was called, ingenuously perhaps, the
struggle for human rights. The fact is that consciousness, once
experienced, cannot be denied. Once women experienced themselves
as and began to understand the reality
and meaning of oppression, they began to articulate a
politically conscious feminism. Their focus, their concrete
objective, was to attain suffrage for
women.

The women's movement formalized itself in 1848 at Seneca Falls when
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, both activist abolitionists,
called a convention. That convention drafted The Seneca Falls
Declaration of Rights and Sentiments which is to this day an
outstanding feminist declaration.

In struggling for the vote, women developed many of the tactics which
were used, almost a century later, in the Civil Rights Movement. In
order to change laws, women had to violate them. In order to change
convention, women had to violate it. The feminists (suffragettes) were
militant political activists who used the tactics of civil disobedience
to achieve their goals.

The struggle for the vote began officially with the Seneca Falls
Convention in 1848. It was not until August 26, 1920, that women
were the vote by the kindly male electorate.
Women did not imagine that the vote would scarcely touch on, let alone
transform, their own oppressive situations. Nor did they imagine that
the "separate but equal" doctrine would develop as a tool of male
dominance. Nor did they imagine the uses to which it would be
put.

There have also been, always, individual feminists --- women who
violated the strictures of the female role, who challenged male
supremacy, who fought for the right to work, or sexual freedom, or
release from the bondage of the marriage contract. Those individuals
were often eloquent when they spoke of the oppression they suffered as
women in their own lives, but other women, properly trained to their
roles, did not listen. Feminists, most often as individuals
but sometimes in small militant groups, fought the system which
oppressed them, analyzed it, were jailed, were ostracized, but there was
no general recognition among women that they were
oppressed.

In the last 5 or 6 years, that recognition has become more widespread
among women. We have begun to understand the extraordinary violence that
has been done to us, that is being done to us: how our minds are aborted
in their development by sexist education; how our bodies are violated by
oppressive grooming imperatives; how the police function against us in
cases of rape and assault; how the media, schools, and churches conspire
to deny us dignity and freedom; how the nuclear family and ritualized
sexual behavior imprison us in roles and forms which are degrading to
us. We developed consciousness-raising sessions to try to fathom the
extraordinary extent of our despair, to try to search out the depth and
boundaries of our internalized anger, to try to find strategies for
freeing ourselves from oppressive relationships, from masochism and
passivity, from our own lack of self-respect. There was both pain and
ecstasy in this process. Women discovered each other, for truly no
oppressed group had ever been so divided and conquered. Women began to
deal with concrete oppressions: to become part of the economic process,
to erase discriminatory laws, to gain control over our own lives and
over our own bodies, to develop the concrete ability to survive on our
own terms. Women also began to articulate structural analyses of sexist
society --- Millett did that with
in Ellen Frankfort
demonstrated the complex and deadly antiwoman biases of the
medical establishment; in Dr.
Phyllis Chesler showed that mental institutions are prisons for women
who rebel against society's well-defined female role.

We began to see ourselves clearly, and what we saw was dreadful. We saw
that we were, as Yoko Ono wrote, the niggers of the world, slaves to the
slave. We saw that we were the ultimate house niggers, ass-licking,
bowing, scraping, shuffling fools. We recognized all of our social
behavior as learned behavior that functioned for survival in a sexist
world: we painted ourselves, smiled, exposed legs and ass, had children,
kept house, as our accommodations to the reality of power
politics.

Most of the women involved in articulating the oppression of women were
white and middle class. We spent, even if we did not earn or control,
enormous sums of money. Because of our participation in the middle-class
lifestyle we were the oppressors of other people, our poor white
sisters, our Black sisters, our Chicana sisters ---and the men who in
turn oppressed them. This closely interwoven fabric of oppression, which
is the racist class structure of Amerika today, assured that wherever
one stood, it was with at least one foot heavy on the belly of another
human being.

As white, middle-class women, we lived in the house of the
oppressor-of-us-all who supported us as he abused us, dressed us as he
exploited us, "treasured" us in payment for the many functions we
performed. We were the best-fed, best-kept, best-dressed, most willing
concubines the world has ever known. We had no dignity and no
real freedom, but we did have good health and long
lives.

The women's movement has not dealt with this bread-and-butter issue,
and that is its most awful failure. There has been little recognition
that the of the middle-class lifestyle
is crucial to the development of decent community forms in which all
people can be free and have dignity. There is certainly no program to
deal with the realities of the class system in Amerika. On the contrary,
most of the women's movement has, with appalling blindness, refused to
take that kind of responsibility. Only the day-care movement has in any
way reflected, or acted pragmatically on, the concrete needs of all
classes of women. The anger at the Nixon administration for cutting
day-care funds is naive at best. Given the structure of power politics
and capital in Amerika, it is ridiculous to expect the federal
government to act in the interests of the people. The money available to
middle-class women who identify as feminists must be channeled into the
programs we want to develop, and must develop
them. In general, middle-class women have absolutely refused to take any
action, make any commitment which would interfere with, threaten, or
significantly alter a lifestyle, a living standard, which is moneyed and
privileged.

The analysis of sexism in this book articulates clearly what the
oppression of women is, how it functions, how it is rooted in psyche and
culture. But that analysis is useless unless it is tied to a political
consciousness and commitment which will totally redefine community. One
cannot be free, never, not ever, in an unfree world, and in the course
of redefining family, church, power relations, all the institutions
which inhabit and order our lives, there is no way to hold onto
privilege and comfort. To attempt to do so is destructive, criminal, and
intolerable.

The nature of women's oppression is unique: women are oppressed as
women, regardless of class or race; some women have access to
significant wealth, but that wealth does not signify power; women are to
be found everywhere, but own or control no appreciable territory; women
live with those who oppress them, sleep with them, have their
children---we are tangled, hopelessly it seems, in the gut of the
machinery and way of life which is ruinous to us. And perhaps most
importantly, most women have little sense of dignity or self-respect or
strength, since those qualities are directly related to a sense of
manhood. In Huey P. Newton
tells us that the Black Panthers did not use guns because they were
symbols of manhood, but found the courage to act as they did because
they were men. When we women find the courage to defend ourselves, to
take a stand against brutality and abuse, we are violating every notion
of womanhood we have ever been taught. The way to freedom for women is
bound to be torturous for that reason alone.

The analysis in this book applies to the life situations of all women,
but all women are not necessarily in a state of primary emergency as
women. What I mean by this is simple. As a Jew in Nazi Germany, I would
be oppressed as a woman, but hunted, slaughtered, as a Jew. As a Native
American, I would be oppressed as a squaw, but hunted, slaughtered, as a
Native American. That first identity, the one which brings with it as
part of its definition death, is the identity of primary emergency. This
is an important recognition because it relieves us of a serious
confusion. The fact, for instance, that many Black women (by no means
all) experience primary emergency as Blacks in no way lessens the
responsibility of the Black community to assimilate this and other
analyses of sexism and to apply it in their own revolutionary
work.

As a writer with a revolutionary commitment, I am particularly pained
by the kinds of books writers are writing, and the reasons why. I want
writers to write books because they are committed to the content of
those books. I want writers to write books as actions. I want writers to
write books that can make a difference in how, and even why, people
live. I want writers to write books that are worth being jailed for,
worth fighting for, and should it come to that in this country, worth
dying for.

Books are for the most part in Amerika commercial ventures. People
write them to make money, to become famous, to build or augment other
careers. Most Amerikans do not read books---they prefer television.
Academics lock books in a tangled web of mindfuck and abstraction. The
notion is that there are ideas, then art, then somewhere else,
unrelated, life. The notion is that to have a decent or moral idea is to
be a decent or moral person. Because of this strange schizophrenia,
books and the writing of them have become embroidery on a dying way of
life. Because there is contempt for the process of writing, for writing
as a way of discovering meaning and truth, and for reading as a piece of
that same process, we destroy with regularity the few serious writers we
have. We turn them into comic-book figures, bleed them of all privacy
and courage and common sense, exorcise their vision from them as sport,
demand that they entertain or be ignored into oblivion. And it is a
great tragedy, for the work of the writer has never been more important
than it is now in Amerika.

Many see that in this nightmared land, language has no meaning and the
work of the writer is ruined. Many see that the triumph of authoritarian
consciousness is its ability to render the spoken and written word
meaningless---so that we cannot talk or hear each other speak. It is the
work of the writer to reclaim the language from those who use it to
justify murder, plunder, violation. The writer can and must do the
revolutionary work of using words to communicate, as
community.

Those of us who love reading and writing believe that being a writer is
a sacred trust. It means telling the truth. It means being
incorruptible. It means not being afraid, and never lying. Those of us
who love reading and writing feel great pain because so many people who
write books have become cowards, clowns, and liars. Those of us who love
reading and writing begin to feel a deadly contempt for books, because
we see writers being bought and sold in the market place --- we see them
vending their tarnished wares on every street corner. Too many writers,
in keeping with the Amerikan way of life, would sell their mothers for a
dime.

To keep the sacred trust of the writer is simply to respect the people
and to love the community. To violate that trust is to abuse oneself and
do damage to others. I believe that the writer has a vital function in
the community, and an absolute responsibility to the people.
I ask that this book be judged in that
context.

Specifically is about women and men,
the roles they play, the violence between them. We begin with fairy
tales, the first scenarios of women and men which mold our psyches,
taught to us before we can know differently. We go on to pornography,
where we find the same scenarios, explicitly sexual and now more
recognizable, ourselves, carnal women and heroic men. We go on to
herstory ---the binding of feet in China, the burning of witches in
Europe and Amerika. There we see the fairy-tale and pornographic
definitions of women functioning in reality, the real annihilation of
real women ---the crushing into nothingness of their freedom, their
will, their lives ---how they were forced to live, and how they were
forced to die. We see the dimensions of the crime, the dimensions of the
oppression, the anguish and misery that are a direct consequence of
polar role definition, of women defined as carnal, evil, and Other. We
recognize that it is the structure of the culture which engineers the
deaths, violations, violence, and we look for alternatives, ways of
destroying culture as we know it, rebuilding it as we can imagine
it.

I write however with a broken tool, a language which is sexist and
discriminatory to its core. I try to make the distinctions, not
"history" as the whole human story, not "man" as the generic term for
the species, not "manhood" as the synonym for courage, dignity, and
strength. But I have not been successful in reinventing the
language.

This work was not done in isolation. It owes much to others. I thank my
sisters who everywhere are standing

up, for themselves, against oppression. I thank my sisters, the women
who are searching into our common past, writing it so that we can know
it and be proud. I thank my sisters, these particular women whose work
has contributed so much to my own consciousness and resolve ---Kate
Millett, Robin Morgan, Shulamith Firestone, Judith Malina, and Jill
Johnston.

I also thank those others who have, through their books and lives,
taught me so much ---in particular, Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin,
Daniel Berrigan, Jean Genet, Huey P. Newton, Julian Beck, and Timothy
Leary.

I thank my friends in Amsterdam who were family for the writing of much
of this book and who helped me in very hard times.

I thank Mel Clay who believed in this book from its most obscure
beginnings, the editors of and in particular
Susan Janssen, Deborah Rogers, Martin Duberman, and Elaine Markson who
has been wonderful to me. I thank Marian Skedgell for her help and
kindness. I thank Brian Murphy who tried to tell me a long time ago that
O was an oppressed person. Chapter 3 is dedicated to Brian.

I thank Karen Malpede and Garland Harris for their support and help. I
thank Joan Schenkar for pushing me a little further than I was willing,
or able, to go.

I thank Grace Paley, Karl Bissinger, Kathleen Norris, and Muriel
Rukeyser. Without their love and friendship this work would never have
been done. Without their examples of strength and commitment, I do not
know who I would be, or how.

I thank my brother Mark and my sister-in-law Carolfor their
friendship, warmth, and trust. And I thank my parents, Sylvia and Harry
Dworkin, for their devotion and support through all these years, which
must have seemed to them interminable, when their daughter was learning
her craft. I thank them for raising me with real caring and tenderness,
for believing in me so that I could learn to believe in
myself.

When one enters the world of fairy tale one seeks with difficulty for
the actual place where legend and history part. One wants to locate the
precise moment when fiction penetrates into the psyche as reality, and
history begins to mirror it. Or vice versa. Women live in fairy tale as
magical figures, as beauty, danger, innocence, malice, and
greed In the personae
of the fairy tale ---the wicked witch, the beautiful princess, the
heroic prince ---we find what the culture would have us know about who
we are.

The point is that we have not formed that ancient world ---it has
formed us. We ingested it as children whole, had its values and
consciousness imprinted on our minds as cultural absolutes long before
we were in fact men and women. We have taken the fairy tales
of childhood with us into maturity, chewed but still lying in
the stomach, as real identity. Between Snow-white and her heroic prince,
our two great fictions, we never did have much of a chance. At some
point, the Great Divide took place: they (the boys) dreamed of mounting
the Great Steed and buying Snow-white from the dwarfs; we (the girls)
aspired to become that object of every necrophiliac's lust ---the
innocent, Sleeping Beauty, beauteous
lump of ultimate, sleeping good. Despite ourselves, sometimes unknowing,
sometimes knowing, unwilling, unable to do otherwise, we act out the
roles we were taught.

Here is the beginning, where we learn who we must be, as well as the
moral of the story.

\




CHAPTER 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Onceuponatime: The Roles**

Death is that remedy all singers dream of

Allen Ginsberg

The culture predetermines who we are, how we behave, what we are
willing to know, what we are able to feel.

We are born into a sex role which is determined by visible sex, or
gender.

We follow explicit scenarios of passage from birth into youth into
maturity into old age, and then we die.

In the process of adhering to sex roles, as a direct consequence of the
imperatives of those roles, we commit homicide, suicide, and
genocide.

Death is our only remedy. We imagine heaven. There is no suffering
there, we say. There is no sex there, we say. We mean, there is no
culture there. We mean, there is no gender there. We dream that death
will release us from suffering---from guilt, sex, the body. We recognize
the body as the source of our suffering. We dream of a death which will
mean freedom from it because here on earth, in our bodies, we are
fragmented, anguished---either men or women, bound by the very fact of a
particularized body to a role which is annihilating, totalitarian, which
forbids us any real self-becoming or self-realization.

Fairy tales are the primary information of the culture. They delineate
the roles, interactions, and values which are available to us. They are
our childhood models, and their fearful, dreadful content
terrorizes us into submission --- if we do not become good, then evil
will destroy us; if we do not achieve the happy ending, then we will
drown in the chaos. As we grow up, we forget the terror---the wicked
witches and their smothering malice. We remember romantic paradigms: the
heroic prince kisses Sleeping Beauty; the heroic prince searches his
kingdom to find Cinderella; the heroic prince marries Snow-white. But
the terror remains as the substratum of male-female relation --- the
terror remains, and we do not ever recover from it or cease to be
motivated by it. Grown men are terrified of the wicked witch,
internalized in the deepest parts of memory. Women are no less
terrified, for we know that not to be passive, innocent, and helpless is
to be actively
evil.

Terror, then, is our real theme.

George Gilder,

Snow-white's biological mother was a passive, good queen who sat at her
window and did embroidery. She pricked her finger one day ---no doubt an
event in her life ---and 3 drops of blood fell from it onto the snow.
Somehow that led her to wish for a child "as white as snow, as red as
blood, and as black as the wood of the embroidery frame." ^1^ Soon
after, she had a daughter with "skin as white as snow, lips as red as
blood, and hair as black as ebony. " ^2^ Then, she died.

A year later, the king married again. His new wife was beautiful,
greedy, and proud. She was, in fact, ambitious and recognized that
beauty was coin in the male realm, that beauty translated directly into
power because it meant male admiration, male alliance, male
devotion.

The new queen had a magic mirror and she would ask it: "Looking-glass
upon the wall, Who is fairest of us all? "^3^ And inevitably, the queen
was the fairest (had there been anyone fairer we can presume that the
king would have married her).

One day the queen asked her mirror who the fairest was, and the mirror
answered: "Queen, you are full fair, \'tis true, But Snow-white fairer
is than you. "^4^ Snow-white was 7 years old.

The queen became "yellow and green with envy, and from that hour her
heart turned against Snow-white, and she hated her. And envy and pride
like ill weeds grew in her heart higher every day, until she had no
peace\.... " ^5^

Now, we all know what nations will do to achieve peace, and the queen
was no less resourceful (she would have made an excellent head of
state). She ordered a huntsman to take Snow-white to the forest, kill
her, and bring back her heart. The huntsman, an uninspired good guy,
could not kill the sweet young thing, so he turned her loose in the
forest, killed a boar, and took its heart back to the queen. The heart
was "salted and cooked, and the wicked woman ate it up, thinking that
there was an end of Snow-white. " ^6^

Snow-white found her way to the home of the 7 dwarfs, who told her that
she could stay with them "if you will keep our house for us, and cook,
and wash, and make the beds, and sew and knit, and keep everything tidy
and clean. " ^7^ They simply adored her.

The queen, who can now be called with conviction the
wicked queen, found out from her mirror that Snow-white was
still alive and fairer than she. She tried several times to kill
Snow-white, who fell into numerous deep sleeps but never quite died.
Finally the wicked queen made a poisoned apple and induced the ever
vigilant Snow-white to bite into it. Snow-white did die, or became more
dead than usual, because the wicked queen's mirror then verified that
she was the fairest in the land.

The dwarfs, who loved Snow-white, could not bear to bury her under the
ground, so they enclosed her in a glass coffin and put the coffin on a
mountaintop. The heroic prince was just passing that way, immediately
fell in love with Snow-white-under-glass, and bought her (it? ) from the
dwarfs who loved her (it? ). As servants carried the coffin along behind
the prince's horse, the piece of poisoned apple that Snow-white had
swallowed "flew out of her throat. " ^8^ She soon revived fully, that is
to say, not much. The prince placed her squarely in the "it" category,
and marriage in its proper perspective too, when he proposed wedded
bliss ---"I would rather have you than anything in the world. " ^9^ The
wicked queen was invited to the wedding, which she attended because her
mirror told her that the bride was fairer than she. At the wedding "they
had ready red-hot iron shoes, in which she had to dance until she fell
down dead. " ^10^

Cinderella's mother-situation was the same. Her biological mother was
good, pious, passive, and soon dead. Her stepmother was greedy,
ambitious, and ruthless. Her ambition dictated that her own daughters
make good marriages. Cinderella meanwhile was forced to do heavy
domestic work, and when her work was done, her stepmother would throw
lentils into the ashes of the stove and make Cinderella separate the
lentils from the ashes. The stepmother's malice toward Cinderella was
not free-floating and irrational. On the contrary, her own social
validation was contingent on the marriages she made for her own
daughters. Cinderella was a real threat to her. Like Snow-white's
stepmother, for whom beauty was power and to be the most beautiful was
to be the most powerful, Cinderella's stepmother knew how the social
structure operated, and she was determined to succeed on its
terms.

Cinderella's stepmother was presumably motivated by maternal love for
her own biological offspring. Maternal love is known to be transcendent,
holy, noble, and unselfish. It is coincidentally also a fundament of
human (male-dominated) civilization and it is the real basis of human
(male-dominated) sexuality:

Cinderella's stepmother understood correctly that her only real work in
life was to marry off her daughters. Her goal was upward mobility, and
her ruthlessness was consonant with the values of the market place.^\*^
She loved her daughters the way Nixon loves the freedom of the
Indochinese, and with much the same result. Love in a male-dominated
society certainly is a many-splendored thing.

\*This depiction of women as flesh on an open market, of crippling and
mutilation for the sake of making a good marriage, is not fiction; cf.
Chapter 6, "Gynocide: Chinese Footbinding. "{.font15
style="font-size: x-small; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"}

Rapunzel's mother wasn't exactly a winner either. She had a
maternal instinct all right---she had "long wished for a child, but in
vain. "^12^ Sometime during her wishing, she developed a craving for
rampion, a vegetable which grew in the garden of her neighbor and peer,
the witch. She persuaded her husband to steal rampion from the witch's
garden, and each day she craved more. When the witch discovered the
theft, she made this
offer:

> > > \... you may have as much rampion as you like, on one condition
> > > --- the child that will come into the world must be given to me.
> > > It shall go well with the child, and I will care for it like a
> > > mother. ^13^

Mama didn't think twice ---she traded Rapunzel for a vegetable.
Rapunzel's surrogate mother, the witch, did not do much better by
her:

> > > When she was twelve years old the witch shut her up in a tower in
> > > the midst of a wood, and it had neither steps nor door, only a
> > > small window above. When the witch wished to be let in, she would
> > > stand below and cry "Rapunzel, Rapunzel! let down your
> > > hair!"^14^

The heroic prince, having finished with Snow-white and Cinderella, now
happened upon Rapunzel. When the witch discovered the liaison, she beat
up Rapunzel, cut off her hair, and cloistered her "in a waste and desert
place, where she lived in great woe and misery. "^15^ The witch then
confronted the prince, who fell from the tower and blinded himself on
thorns. (He recovered when he found Rapunzel, and they then lived
happily ever after. )

Hansel and Grethel had a mother too. She simply abandoned
them:

> > > I will tell you what, husband\.... We will take the children
> > > early in the morning into the forest, where it is thickest; we
> > > will make them a fire, and we will give each of them a piece of
> > > bread, then we will go to our work and leave them alone; they will
> > > never find the way home again, and we shall be quit of
> > > them.^16^

Hungry, lost, frightened, the children find a candy house which belongs
to an old lady who is kind to them, feeds them, houses them. She greets
them as her children, and proves her maternal commitment by preparing to
cannibalize them.

These fairy-tale mothers are mythological female figures. They define
for us the female character and delineate its existential possibilities.
When she is good, she is soon dead. In fact, when she is good, she is so
passive in life that death must be only more of the same. Here we
discover the cardinal principle of sexist ontology---the only good woman
is a dead woman. When she is bad she lives, or when she lives she is
bad. She has one real function, motherhood. In that function, because it
is active, she is characterized by overwhelming malice, devouring greed,
uncontainable avarice. She is ruthless, brutal, ambitious, a danger to
children and other living things. Whether called mother, queen,
stepmother, or wicked witch, she is the wicked witch, the content of
nightmare, the source of terror.

For a woman to be good, she must be dead, or as close to it as
possible. Catatonia is the good woman's most winning quality.

Sleeping Beauty slept for 100 years, after pricking her finger on a
spindle. The kiss of the heroic prince woke her. He fell in love with
her while she was asleep, or was it because she was asleep?

Snow-white was already dead when the heroic prince fell in love with
her. "I beseech you, " he pleaded with the 7 dwarfs, "to give it to me,
for I cannot live without looking upon Snow-white. " ^17^ It awake was
not readily distinguishable from it asleep.

Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow-white, Rapunzel ---all are
characterized by passivity, beauty, innocence, and
victimization. They are archetypal good women --- victims by
definition. They never think, act, initiate, confront, resist,
challenge, feel, care, or question. Sometimes they are forced to do
housework.

They have one scenario of passage. They are moved, as if inert, from
the house of the mother to the house of the prince. First they are
objects of malice, then they are objects of romantic adoration. They do
nothing to warrant either.

That one other figure of female good, the good fairy, appears from time
to time, dispensing clothes or virtue. Her power cannot match, only
occasionally moderate, the power of the wicked witch. She does have one
physical activity at which she excels ---she waves her wand. She is
beautiful, good, and unearthly. Mostly, she disappears.

These figures of female good are the heroic models available to women.
And the end of the story is, it would seem, the goal of any female life.
To sleep, perchance to dream?

Miguel de Unamuno,\
Tragic Sense of Life

He is handsome and heroic. He is a prince, that is, he is powerful,
noble, and good. He rides a horse. He travels far and wide. He has a
mission, a purpose. Inevitably he fulfills it. He is a person of worth
and a worthwhile person. He is strong and true.

Of course, he is not real, and men do suffer trying to become him. They
suffer, and murder, and rape, and plunder. They use airplanes
now.

What matters is that he is both powerful and good, that his power is by
definition good. What matters is that he matters, acts,
succeeds.

One can point out that in fact he is not very bright. For
instance, he cannot distinguish Cinderella from her two sisters though
he danced with her and presumably conversed with her. His recurring love
of corpses does not indicate a dynamic intelligence either. His fall
from the tower onto thorns does not suggest that he is even physically
coordinated, though, unlike his modern counterparts, he never falls off
his horse or annihilates the wrong
village.

The truth of it is that he is powerful and good when contrasted with
her. The badder she is, the better he is. The deader she is, the better
he is. That is one moral of the story, the reason for dual role
definition, and the shabby reality of the man as hero.

The Husband, the Real Father{.font7
style="font-weight:bold;"}

George Gilder,

Mostly they are kings, or noble and rich. They are, again by
definition, powerful and good. They are never responsible or held
accountable for the evil done by their wicked wives. Most of the time,
they do not notice it.

There is, of course, no rational basis for considering them either
powerful or good. For while they are governing, or kinging, or whatever
it is that they do do, their wives are slaughtering and abusing their
beloved progeny. But then, in some cultures
nonfairy-tale fathers simply had their female children killed
at birth.

Cinderella's father saw her every day. He saw her picking lentils out
of the ashes, dressed in rags, degraded, insulted. He was a good
man.

The father of Hansel and Grethel also had a good heart. When his wife
proposed to him that they abandon the children in the forest to starve
he protested immediately---"But I really pity the poor children. " ^18^
When Hansel and Grethel finally escaped the witch and found their way
home "they rushed in at the door, and fell on their father's neck. The
man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood
\Hansel, after all, was a boy\; but the wife was dead. " ^19^ Do not
misunderstand ---they did not forgive him, for there was nothing to
forgive. All malice originated with the woman. He was a good
man.

Though the fairy-tale father marries the evil woman in the first place,
has no emotional connection with his child, does not interact in any
meaningful way with her, abandons her and worse does not notice when she
is dead and gone, he is a figure of male good. He is the patriarch, and
as such he is beyond moral law and human decency.

The roles available to women and men are clearly articulated in fairy
tales. The characters of each are vividly described, and so are the
modes of relationship possible between them. We see that powerful women
are bad, and that good women are inert. We see that men are always good,
no matter what they do, or do not do.

We also have an explicit rendering of the nuclear family. In
that family, a mother's love is destructive, murderous. In that family,
daughters are objects, expendable. The nuclear family, as we find it
delineated in fairy tales, is a paradigm of male being-in-the-world,
female evil, and female victimization. It is a crystallization of sexist
culture ---the nuclear structure of that
culture.

Emily Bronte

The lessons are simple, and we learn them well.

Men and women are different, absolute opposites.

The heroic prince can never be confused with Cinderella, or Snow-white,
or Sleeping Beauty. She could never do what he does at all, let alone
better.

Men and women are different, absolute opposites.

The good father can never be confused with the bad mother. Their
qualities are different, polar.

Where he is erect, she is supine. Where he is awake, she is asleep.
Where he is active, she is passive. Where she is erect, or
awake, or active, she is evil and must be
destroyed.

It is, structurally at least, that simple.

She is desirable in her beauty, passivity, and victimization. She is
desirable because she is beautiful, passive, and victimized.

Her other persona, the evil mother, is repulsive in her cruelty. She is
repulsive and she must be destroyed. She is the female protagonist, the
nonmale source of power which must be defeated, obliterated, before male
power can fully flower. She is repulsive because she is evil. She is
evil because she acts.

She, the evil persona, is a cannibal. Cannibalism is repulsive. She is
devouring and magical. She is devouring and the male must not be
devoured.

There are two definitions of woman. There is the good woman. She is a
victim. There is the bad woman. She must be destroyed. The good woman
must be possessed. The bad woman must be killed, or punished. Both must
be nullified.

The bad woman must be punished, and if she is punished enough, she will
become good. To be punished enough is to be destroyed. There is the good
woman. She is the victim. The posture of victimization, the passivity of
the victim demands abuse.

Women strive for passivity, because women want to be good. The abuse
evoked by that passivity convinces women that they are bad. The bad need
to be punished, destroyed, so that they can become good.

Even a woman who strives conscientiously for passivity sometimes does
something. That she acts at all provokes abuse. The abuse provoked by
that activity convinces her that she is bad. The bad need to be
punished, destroyed, so that they can become good.

The moral of the story should, one would think, preclude a happy
ending. It does not. The moral of the story is the happy ending. It
tells us that happiness for a woman is to be passive, victimized,
destroyed, or asleep. It tells us that happiness is for the woman who is
good ---inert, passive, victimized---and that a good woman is a happy
woman. It tells us that the happy ending is when we are ended, when we
live without our lives or not at all.

Bookshop shelves are lined with pornography. It is a staple of the
market place, and where it is illegal it flourishes and prices soar.
From
to,
cheap-editioned, overpriced renditions of fucking, sucking, whipping,
footlicking, gangbanging, etc., in all of their manifold varieties are
available --- whether in the supermarket or on the black market. Most
literary pornography is easily describable: repetitious to the point of
inducing catatonia, ill-conceived, simple-minded, brutal, and very ugly.
Why, then, do we spend our money on it? Why, then, is it erotically
stimulating for masses of men and women?

Literary pornography is the cultural scenario of male/female. It is the
collective scenario of master/slave. It contains cultural truth: men and
women, grown now out of the fairy-tale landscape into the castles of
erotic desire; woman, her carnality adult and explicit, her role as
victim adult and explicit, her guilt adult and explicit, her punishment
lived out on her flesh, her end annihilation ---death or complete
submission.

Pornography, like fairy tale, tells us who we are. It is the
structure of male and female mind, the content of our shared erotic
identity, the map of each inch and mile of our oppression and despair.
Here we move beyond childhood terror. Here the fear is clammy and real,
and rightly so. Here we are compelled to ask the real questions: why are
we defined in these ways, and how can we bear
it?

\




CHAPTER 3

------------------------------------------------------------------------



The by Pauline Reage, incorporates,
along with all literary pornography, principles and characters already
isolated in my discussion of children's fairy tales. The female as a
figure of innocence and evil enters the adult world---the brutal world
of genitalia. The female manifests in her adult form---cunt. She emerges
defined by the hole between her legs. In addition, Story of
O is more than simple pornography. It claims to define
epistemologically what a woman is, what she needs, her processes of
thinking and feeling, her proper place. It links men and women in an
erotic dance of some magnitude: the sado-masochistic complexion of O is
not trivial ---it is formulated as a cosmic principle which,
articulates, absolutely, the feminine.

Also, O is particularly compelling for me because I once believed it to
be what its defenders claim ---the mystical revelation of the true,
eternal, and sacral destiny of women. The book was absorbed as a
pulsating, erotic, secular Christianity (the joy in pure suffering,
woman as Christ figure). I experienced O with the same infantile abandon
as the reviewer who wrote: "What lifts
this fascinating book above mere perversity is its movement toward the
transcendence of the self through a gift of the self\... to give the
body, to allow it to be ravaged, exploited, and totally possessed can be
an act of consequence, if it is done with love for the sake of love. "
^1^ Any clear-headed appraisal of O will show the situation, O's
condition, her behavior, and most importantly her attitude toward her
oppressor as a logical scenario incorporating Judeo-Christian values of
service and self-sacrifice and universal notions of womanhood, a logical
scenario demonstrating the psychology of submission and self-hatred
found in all oppressed peoples. O is a book of astounding political
significance.

This is, then, the story of O: O is taken by her lover Rene to Roissy
and cloistered there; she is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated,
and tortured on a regular and continuing basis ---she is programmed to
be an erotic slave, Rene's personal whore; after being properly trained
she is sent home with her lover; her lover gives her to Sir Stephen, his
half-brother; she is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated, and
tortured on a regular and continuing basis; she is ordered to become the
lover of Jacqueline and to recruit her for Roissy, which she does; she
is sent to Anne-Marie to be branded with Sir Stephen's mark and to have
rings with his insignia inserted in her cunt; she serves as an erotic
model for Jacqueline's younger sister Natalie who is infatuated with
her; she is taken to a party masked as an owl, led on a leash by
Natalie, and there plundered, despoiled, raped, gangbanged; realizing
that there is nothing else left for Sir Stephen to do with her or to
her, fearing that he will abandon her, she asks his
permission to kill herself and receives it. Q. E. D.,
pornography is never big on
plot.

Of course, like most summaries, the above is somewhat sketchy. I have
not mentioned the quantities of cock that O sucks, or the anal assaults
that she sustains, or the various rapes and tortures perpetrated on her
by minor characters in the book, or the varieties of whips used, or
described her clothing or the different kinds of nipple rouge, or the
many ways in which she is chained, or the shapes and colors of the welts
on her body.

From the course of O's story emerges a clear mythological figure: she
is woman, and to name her O, zero, emptiness, says it all. Her ideal
state is one of complete passivity, nothingness, a submission so
absolute that she transcends human form (in becoming an owl). Only the
hole between her legs is left to define her, and the symbol of that hole
must surely be O. Much, however, even in the rarefied environs of
pornography, necessarily interferes with the attainment of utter
passivity. Given a body which takes up space, has needs, makes demands,
is connected, even symbolically, to a personal history which is a
sequence of likes, dislikes, skills, opinions, one is formed,
shaped---one exists at the very least as positive space. And since in
addition as a woman one is born guilty and carnal, personifying the sins
of Eve and Pandora, the wickedness of Jezebel and Lucre-tia Borgia, O's
transcendence of the species is truly phenomenal.

The thesis of O is simple. Woman is cunt, lustful, wanton. She must be
punished, tamed, debased. She gives the gift of herself, her body, her
well-being, her life, to her lover. This is as it should be
---natural and good. It ends necessarily in her annihilation,
which is also natural and good, as well as beautiful, because she
fulfills her
destiny:

O is totally possessed. That means that she is an object, with no
control over her own mobility, capable of no assertion of personality.
Her body is body, in the same way that a pencil
is a pencil, a bucket is a bucket, or, as Gertrude Stein pointedly said,
a rose is a rose. It also means that O's energy, or power, as a woman,
as Woman, is absorbed. Possession here denotes a biological transference
of power which brings with it a commensurate spiritual
strength to the possessor. O does more than offer herself; she is
herself the offering. To offer herself would be prosaic Christian
self-sacrifice, but as the offering she is the vehicle of the
miraculous---she incorporates the
divine.

Here sacrifice has its ancient, primal meaning: that which was given at
the beginning becomes the gift. The first fruits of the harvest were
dedicated to and consumed by the vegetation spirit which provided them.
The destruction of the victim in human or animal sacrifice or the
consumption of the offering was the very definition of the
sacrifice---death was necessary because the victim was or represented
the life-giving substance, the vital energy source, which had to be
liberated, which only death could liberate. An actual death, the
sacrifice per se, not only liberated benevolent energy but also ensured
a propagation and increase of life energy (concretely expressed as
fertility) by a sort of magical ecology, a recycling of basic energy, or
raw power. O's victimization is the confirmation of her power, a power
which is transcendental and which has as its essence the sacred
processes of life, death, and regeneration.

But the full significance of possession, both mystically and
mythologically, is not yet clear. In mystic experience communion
(wrongly called possession sometimes) has meant the dissolution of the
ego, the entry into ecstasy, union with and illumination of the godhead.
The experience of communion has been the province of the mystic,
prophet, or visionary, those who were able to alchemize their energy
into pure spirit and this spirit into a state of grace. Possession,
rightly defined, is the perversion of the mystic experience;
it is by its very nature demonic because its goal is power, its means
are violence and oppression. It spills the blood of its victim and in
doing so estranges itself from life-giving union. O's lover thinks that
she gives herself freely but if she did not, he would take her anyway.
Their relationship is the incarnation of demonic
possession:

A precise corollary of possession is prostitution. The prostitute, the
woman as object, is defined by the usage to which the possessor puts
her. Her subjugation is the signet of his power. Prostitution means for
the woman the carnal annihilation of will and choice, but for the man it
once again signifies an increase in power, pure and simple. To call the
power of the possessor, which he demonstrates by playing superpimp,
divine, or to confuse it with ecstasy or communion, is to grossly
misunderstand. "All the mouths that had probed her mouth, all the hands
that had seized her breasts and belly, all the members that had been
thrust into her had so perfectly provided the living proof that she was
worthy of being prostituted and had, so to speak, sanctified her. " ^7^
Of course, it is not O who is sanctified, but Rene, or Sir Stephen, or
the others, through her.

O's prostitution is a vicious caricature of old-world religious
prostitution. The ancient sacral prostitution of the Hebrews, Greeks,
Indians, et al., was the ritual expression of respect and veneration for
the powers of fertility and generation. The priestesses/prostitutes of
the temple were literal personifications of the life energy of the earth
goddess, and transferred that energy to those who participated in her
rites. The cosmic principles, articulated as divine male and divine
female, were ritually united in the temple because clearly only through
their continuing and repeated union could the fertility of the earth and
the well-being of a people be ensured. Sacred prostitution was "nothing
less than an act of communion with god (or godhead) and was as remote
from sensuality as the Christian act of communion is remote from
gluttony. " ^8^ O and all of the women at Roissy are distinguished by
their sterility and bear no resemblance whatsoever to any known goddess.
No mention is ever made of conception or menstruation, and procreation
is never a consequence of fucking. O's fertility has been rendered O.
There is nothing sacred about O's prostitution.

O's degradation is occasioned by the male need for and fear of
initiation into manhood. Initiation rites generally include a period of
absolute solitude, isolation, followed by tests of physical courage,
mental endurance, often through torture and physical mutilation,
resulting in a permanent scar or tattoo which marks the successful
initiate. The process of initiation is designed to reveal the values,
rites, and rules of manhood and confers on the initiate the
responsibilities and privileges of manhood. What occurs at Roissy is a
clear perversion of real initiation. Rene and the others mutilate O's
body, but they are themselves untouched. Her body substitutes for their
bodies. O is marked with the scars which they should bear. She undergoes
their ordeal for them, endures the solitude and isolation, the torture,
the mutilation. In trying to become gods, they have bypassed the
necessary rigors of becoming men. The fact that the tortures must be
repeated endlessly, not only on O but on large numbers of women who are
forced as well as persuaded, demonstrates that the men of Roissy never
in fact become men, are never initiates, never achieve the security of
realized manhood.

What would be the sign of the initiate, the final mark or scar,
manifests in the case of O as an ultimate expression of sadism. The
rings through O's cunt with Sir Stephen's name and heraldry, and the
brand on her ass, are permanent wedding rings rightly placed. They mark
her as an owned object and in no way symbolize the passage into maturity
and freedom. The same might be said of the conventional wedding
ring.

O,  in her never-ending role as surrogate everything, also is the
direct sexual link between Sir Stephen and Rene. That the two men love
each other and fuck each other through O is made clear by the fact that
Sir Stephen uses O anally most of the time. The consequences of
misdirecting sexual energy are awesome indeed.

But what is most extraordinary about
is the mind-boggling literary style of Pauline Reage, its author. O is
wanton yet pure, Sir Stephen is cruel yet kind, Rene is brutal yet
gentle, a wall is black yet white. Everything is what it is, what it
isn't, and its direct opposite. That technique, which is so skillfully
executed, might help to account for the compelling irrationality
of For those women who are convinced
yet doubtful, attracted yet repelled, there is this schema for
self-protection: *the double-double think that the author
engages in is very easy to deal with if we just realize that we only
have to double-double unthink it*.

To sum up, is a story of psychic
cannibalism, demonic possession, a story which posits men and women as
being at opposite poles of the universe --- the survival of one
dependent on the absolute destruction of the other. It asks, like many
stories, who is the most powerful, and it answers: men are, literally
over women's dead bodies.

CHAPTER 4{.font8
style="font-weight:bold;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Image, by Jean de Berg, is a love story, a Christian
love story and also a story of Christian love. No book makes more clear
the Christian experience of woman after the fall, as we know her, Eve's
unfortunate descendant., like the
catechism, is a handbook of Christianity in action. In
addition, is an almost clinical
dissection of role-playing and its sex-relatedness, of duality as the
structural basis of male-female violence.

It would be an exaggeration of some substance to call the following a
summary of plot, but what happens in is
this: Jean de Berg, the auteur of, meets
Claire, whom he has known casually for many years, at a party; he has
always been interested in her, but her coldness, aloofness, and perfect
beauty made her lack the necessary vulnerability which would have made
her, in the tradition, a
desirable conquest; Claire introduces him to Anne, Innocent Young Girl
Dressed In White, who, it turns out, is Claire's slave; they go to a bar
where Anne is offered to Jean de Berg; they go to a rose garden where
Anne sticks a rose by its thorns into the flesh of her
cunt; they go to a restaurant where Claire shames Anne, an
event often repeated (Claire shames Anne by ordering her to raise her
skirt, or lower her blouse, or by sticking her finger up Anne's cunt);
Claire shows Jean de Berg photographs in the artsy-craftsy
sadomasochistic tradition for which Anne modeled, except for the last
photograph, which is clearly a photo of Claire herself; Claire whips
Anne; Anne sucks Jean de Berg's cock; Jean de Berg takes Anne to buy
lingerie and humiliates Anne and embarrasses the salesgirl by exhibiting
Anne's whip scars which are fresh; Anne is given a bath by Claire in
Jean de Berg's presence in which Anne is almost drowned (erotically); it
occurs to Jean de Berg that he would like to fuck Claire ---which causes
Claire to increase the viciousness of her assaults on Anne; Anne is
tortured in the Gothic chamber and then ravaged anally by Jean de Berg;
Jean de Berg goes home, has a dream about Claire, is awakened by a knock
on the door, and lo and behold! Claire has recognized her true role in
life (" 'I have come, ' she said quietly")^1^ --- that of Jean de Berg's
slave. He hits her, and she lives happily ever
after.

Of course, the above is again somewhat sketchy. I did not mention that
Anne was forced to piss in public in the rose garden, or how she was
nasty to Jean de Berg in a bookstore (a crucial point ---since she then
had to be punished), or how she fetched the whips herself, or how she
was made to serve Claire and Jean de Berg orangeade before they stuck
burning needles in her breasts.

The characterizations have even less depth and complexity, not to
mention subtlety and sensitivity, than the plot. Claire is cold and
aloof. Jean de Berg describes her:

> > > Claire was very beautiful, as I said, probably even more
> > > beautiful than her friend in the white dress. But unlike the
> > > latter, she had never aroused any real emotion in me. This
> > > astonished me at first, but then I told myself that it was her
> > > impeccable beauty, precisely, her very perfection that made it
> > > impossible to think of her as a potential "conquest. " I probably
> > > needed to feel that some little thing about her, at least, was
> > > vulnerable, in order to arouse any desire in me to win her.
> > > ^2^

He later writes: "Her classic features, her cold beauty, her remoteness
made me think of some goddess in exile.\"^3^ Here the female
characterization is explicit: vulnerability as the main quality of the
human; coldness as the main quality of the goddess. As in most fiction,
the female characterization is synonymous with an appraisal of the
figure's beauty, its type, and most importantly, its effect on the male
figures in the book.

Anne, who is, according to Pauline Reage, the other half of Claire, is
sweet, modest, vulnerable, young, demure ("Anne, for her part, had
resumed the modest demeanor of an object of lust"^4^), and wanton.
Claire says that Anne creams at each new humiliation, at even the
thought of being whipped. Anne appears to be Beth from Little
Women but is, in fact, a bitch in heat, her cunt always
wet---just like the rest of us, we are meant to conclude. (Beth,
remember, died young of goodness. )

Jean de Berg, representing the male sex, is---wouldn't you know
it---intelligent, self-assured, quietly masterful and
self-contained when not actually in the act of ravaging, powerful and
overwhelmingly virile when in the act of ravaging. One has no idea of
his physicality, except to imagine that he is graying at the
temples.

The relationships between the three characters are structured simply
and a bit repetitively: Claire, master --- Anne, slave; Jean de Berg,
master ---Anne, slave; which resolves into the happy ending---Jean de
Berg, master --- Claire, slave. The master-slave motif is content,
structure, and moral of the story. The master role is always a male
role, the slave role is always a female role. The moral of the story is
that Claire, by virtue of her gender, can only find happiness in the
female/slave role.

Here we are told what society would have us know about lesbian
relationships: a man is required for completion, consummation. Claire is
miscast as master because of her literal sex, her genitalia. Jean de
Berg is her surrogate cock which she later forges into the instrument of
her own degradation. paints women as
real female eunuchs, mutilated in the first instance, much as Freud
suggested, by their lack of cock, incapable of achieving whole, organic,
satisfying sexual union without the intrusion and participation of a
male figure. That figure cannot only act out the male role ---that
figure must possess biological cock and balls. Claire and Anne as
biological females enact a comedy, grotesque in its slapstick
caricature: Claire as master, a freak by virtue of the role she wills to
play, a role designed to suit the needs and capacities of a man; Claire
as master, as comic as Chaplin doing the king of France, or Laurel and
Hardy falling over each other's feet in another vain attempt to secure
wealth 
forces us to conclude, what can Claire stick up Anne's cunt but her
fingers --- hardly instruments of ravishment and ecstasy. Biology, we
are told, is role. Biology, we are told, is fate. The message is
strangely familiar.

Pauline Reage, the major promoter of as
a piece of metaphysical veracity, sees the function, or very existence,
of the man-master, as the glorification of the woman-slave. Her thesis
is that to be a slave is to have power:

> > > \... the all powerful slave, dragging herself along the ground at
> > > her master's heels, is now really the god. The man is only her
> > > priest, living in fear and trembling of her displeasure. His sole
> > > function is to perform the various ceremonies that center around
> > > the sacred object. ^5^

With the logic indigenous to our dual-role culture, the slave is here
transmuted into the source of power. What price power, one asks in
despair. This is truly the source of the male notion of
female power---since she is at the center of his
obsession no matter
that the form her power takes is that she "drag herself along the ground
at her master's heels. "

The man, Reage instructs us, has the of
power because he wields the whip. That illusion marks for Reage the
distance between carnal knowledge and what is, more profoundly,
true:

> > > Yes, men are foolish to expect us to revere them when, in the
> > > end, they amount to almost nothing. Woman, like man himself, can
> > > only worship at the shrine of that abused body, now loved and now
> > > reviled, subjected to every humiliation, but which is, after all,
> > > her own. The man, in this particular affair, stays in one piece:
> > > he is the true worshiper, aspiring in vain to become one with his
> > > god.

> > > The woman, on the contrary, although just as much of a true
> > > worshiper and possessed of that same anxious regard (for herself)
> > > is also the divine object, violated, endlessly sacrificed yet
> > > always reborn, whose only joy, achieved through a subtle interplay
> > > of images, lies in contemplation of herself. ^6^

Having noted in the last chapter Reage's extraordinary facility with
the double-double think, which she uses here with her usual skill, I
must take exception to her conclusions. It is surprising that the
worship of the divine object, the woman as victim and executioner,
should involve external mediation, especially
that of a male priest. Surely if woman is so willing to be the giver and
the offering, if as "the divine object, violated, endlessly sacrificed
yet always reborn" her "only joy\... lies in contemplation of herself, "
a man is extraneous. Surely, with such divine endowments and attendant
satisfactions, she need not be coaxed or seduced into whipping or
mutilating herself ("And yet it is usually the men who introduce their
mistresses to the joys of being chained and whipped, tortured and
humiliated\.... " ^7^), or initiating other women, who serve as a
substitute or mirror image or other half. Men often insist that women
are self-serving, and indeed, Claire is Anne's priestess. Both execute
their roles effectively. No male figure is required mythologically
unless Jean de Berg would play the eunuch-priest, that traditional
helpmate of the priestess, an honor no doubt not intended for him here.
Conversely, only men have been permitted to serve male gods; eunuchs and
women, synonymous here, have been strictly excluded from those holy
rites. The proper conclusion therefore is that man, not woman, is the
divine object of he is the priest; he
serves a male god in whose image he was created; he serves himself. Were
that not the case, woman, as the worshiped, would serve herself, instead
of serving herself up like turkey or duck, garnished, stuffed, sharpened
knife ready for the ritual carving. That a man becomes the master of the
master means, despite Reage's assertions to the contrary, that women
should serve men, that women are properly slaves and men properly
masters, that men have the only meaningful power (in our culture ---that
power allied to and defined by force and violence), that men created in
the image of the Almighty are all mighty. Single-single think brings us
closer to the truth in this instance than double-double think.

The Image is rife with Christian symbolism. One of the more
memorable sequences in the book takes place in a rose garden chosen by
Claire as the proper proscenium for Anne's humiliation. In the rose
garden, Claire directs Jean de Berg's attention to a specific type of
rose, special in its perfect beauty. Claire orders Anne to step into the
flowerbed and to fondle the rose, which Anne handles as though it were a
moist, ready cunt. Claire orders Anne to pick the rose and to bring it
to her, which Anne does, though not before she feebly protests that
there is a prohibition against picking the flowers and that she is
afraid of the thorns. Anne's hesitation necessitates punishment. She is
ordered to lift her dress while Claire first strokes Anne's cunt with
the rose, then jabs the thorn into her thigh and tears the flesh very
deliberately. Claire kisses Anne's hands as a poetic drop of blood
flows. Claire then pushes the stem of the rose into Anne's garter belt.
The thorn is caught in the lace, and the flower is fastened, an
adornment fraught with symbolic meaning. Even Jean de Berg finds the
performance a bit overdone:

> > > I answered that it was indeed a great success, although perhaps
> > > rather overburdened with symbols, in the romantic and surrealist
> > > traditions. ^8^

The rose as a symbol has powerful occult origins. Eliphas Levi says of
it:

> > > It was the flesh in rebellion against the oppression of spirit;
> > > it was Nature testifying that, like grace, she was a daughter of
> > > God; it was love refusing to be stifled by the celibate; it was
> > > life in revolt against sterility; it was humanity aspiring towards
> > > natural religion, full of reason and love, founded on the
> > > revelations of the harmony of being, of which the rose, for
> > > initiates, was the living floral symbol. ^9^

The rose became for Christian mystics "a rose of light in the center of
which a human figure is extending its arms in the form of a cross. "
^10^ However, the official Church, in its unending struggle against
carnality and nature, posited the rose as a symbol of both in opposition
to the lily, which represented purity of mind and body. The
Image takes a stand on the side of official Christianity by
using the rose as an instrument of pain and blood-letting.

The photographs which Claire shows to Jean de Berg are also overflowing
with symbolic importance. The photographs are a series of conventional
sadomasochistic poses. They chart the torture and mutilation of a
victim, in this case Anne, and culminate in what is apparently the
brutal stabbing, the actual death, of the victim. Together they reveal a
woman's preoccupation with her own body, a narcissism which is
concretized in the last photograph, which is of Claire herself,
faceless, caressing her own cunt. This narcissism is a flaw which
defines woman, and to atone for it a woman must, in the glorious
tradition of O, consent to and participate in her own annihilation. Such
is the scenario which permits her a Christian salvation, which redeems
her of the sin of Eve and the subsequent sin of her own self-love. The
photographs are "really nothing more than religious pictures, steps
along the way of a new road to the cross." ^11^ The road, however, is an
old one, well traveled, and if the cross is difficult to reach via this
particular road, it is only because the bodies of martyrs other than
Anne and Claire lie piled so deep.

It is only too obvious that the tortured, mutilated woman who appears
first as Anne, then as the more impersonal victim of the photographs,
and finally in a dream of Jean de Berg's as a dead body "pierced by many
triangular stab wounds in the most propitious areas" ^12^ is the secular
Christ of cunt and breast, Eve's fallen, lustful, carnal descendant, the
victim who, unlike Jesus, is suffering for her own sins, the criminal
whose punishment scarcely equals the horror of her crime. That crime, of
course, is biological womanhood. Jesus died for us once, the crucifixion
he suffered sufficed, we are told, for all time. Anne, Claire, O, all
will be forced spread-eagle on the cross until death releases them, and
then again. No cruelty will ever be proper atonement for their crime,
and thus set the rest of us free.

Christianity has one other image of woman, Mary, the Madonna, the
Virgin Mother. Jean de Berg dreams of Claire as the Madonna shortly
before he beats and fucks her. Surely that demonstrates the psychic
significance, in a sexist culture, of the Madonna figure. Just as Anne
on the cross was a profanation of the sacred nature of women, so is the
concept, the Lie, of a virgin mother, separate from her cunt, separate
from nature, innocent by virtue of the abandonment of her real, and most
honorable, sexuality.

The worship of virginity must be posited as a real sexual perversion,
crueler and more insidious than those sex models condemned by the
culture as perverse. The Christian institutionalization of that worship,
its cultivation and refinement, have aborted women in the development
and expression of natural sexuality by giving credence to that other:
woman as whore. The dualism of good and evil, virgin and whore, lily and
rose, spirit and nature is inherent in Christianity and finds its
logical expression in the rituals of sadomasochism. The Christian
emphasis on pain and suffering as the path to transcendence and
salvation is the very meat of most sadomasochistic pornography, just as
the Christian definition of woman is its justification. Lenny Bruce
expressed it very simply when he said this:

> > > I understand that intellectually --- that a woman who sleeps with
> > > a different guy every week is a better Christian than the virgin.
> > > Because she has the capacity to kiss and hug fifty guys a year.
> > > And that\'s what that act is ---kissing and hugging. You can't do
> > > it to anyone you're mad at. If you're just a bit bugged with them,
> > > you can't make it.

> > > So that chick who\'s got that much love for all her fellowmen
> > > that she can make it with fifty guys a year--- that's
> > > intellectually; but emotionally, I don't want to be the
> > > fifty-first guy. Cause I learned my lesson early, man. The people
> > > told me, "This is the way it is, Virgin is Good, Virgin is Good. "
> > > Yeah, that's really weird. ^13^

As the most obvious male Christ figure of our time, he should
know.



CHAPTER 5

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Woman as Victim: Suck**

We move from the straight literary pornography of our forebears,
represented by The
Image, into another realm, that of the sex newspaper, born of
the hip culture (or, as we like to think, counter-culture), post sex
revolution (Freudian, Reichian, Mailerian, Brucean, Ginsbergian), post
pot, post acid, post pill: post Them and into the world of Us. We move
into the realm of here and now, our own turned-on, liberated time and
space, into the social world for which we are responsible. Since we seek
in that world freedom as women, defined in radical terms, achieved
through a concretely lived lifestyle, newspapers like
Suck
Screw is Them
---no doubt Kissinger and Sinatra sleep with it tucked under the pillow.
But the counter-culture sex papers are created by people who inhabit our
world (freaks, drug users, radicals, longhairs, whatever the appropriate
term might be), people who share our values, our concerns --- people who
talk of liberation. The counter-culture sex papers would be a part of
our community and so we are obliged, if we are a community, to approach
them critically and seriously, to ask what they bring to us and what
they take from us.

"Us" ---who are we? Jerry Rubin says that we are the Children of
Amerika. Eldridge Cleaver calls us the Children of BLOOD. It is our
parents, Amerika, BLOOD, who through their moral bankruptcy and
genocidal ways have forced us from the womb onto the streets of the
nation. It is our parents, Amerika, BLOOD, whom we refuse to be, whose
work we refuse to do. We are the survivors of Flower Power, now adult,
with our own children. We are the tribes of Woodstock Nation, now in
Diaspora, roaming the whole earth. We are the New Left, wounded, in
disarray. We are not yet extinct, and we are not nearly finished. Our
past is only prologue.

Generally we are between 24 and 35 years old; have used acid,
mescaline, psilocibin, etc., with some frequency; use grass and hashish
often with no mystification; have probably used cocaine, amphetamines,
or barbiturates at some time; have frequent sexual relations, many of
which are absolutely casual; reject the nuclear family and seek forms of
community antagonistic to it. We are the people who listened to Leary,
Ginsberg, Bruce. Politically we are radicals. Some of us seek to develop
radical forms of community, to live good, simple, natural lives. Some of
us engage in explicitly political actions ---opposing illegitimate wars,
resisting the uses of illegitimate authority ---we wonder how to kill
pigs without becoming pigs, we are immersed in the
process of revolution, we learn the skills of revolution, we
resist all forms of current authority and we simultaneously seek to
develop alternatives to those forms. There are diminishing numbers of
peace freaks among us (totally committed to nonviolent revolution) and
quite a few roaring anarchists. We are, at least in our Amerikan
manifestation, white, children of privilege, children of liberals and
reformists. We were brought up in pretty, clean homes, had lots of
privacy, friends, companionship from family and peers. We are
unbelievably well educated ---we went to fine suburban schools (mostly
public) where we experienced physical and intellectual regimentation
which we found unbearable; we went to the best colleges and universities
(mostly private) where we studied anthropology, Freud, Marx, Norman O.
Brown, and Marcuse too, with the finest minds who, it turned out, were
chicken shit when it came to applying egalitarian principles in the
classroom or outside of it. The universities where we studied all of
these disembodied ideas continued doing defense work for the Amerikan
government. We have had our share of disaster and despair: the acid
tragedies, the Weatherman tragedies, the needle tragedies. Many of us
have known jail, and we have all seen friends die. We are older than we
ever thought we would be.

What it comes down to is this: through the use of drugs, through sexual
living out, through radical political action, we broke through the
bourgeois mental sets which were our inheritance but retained the
humanism crucial to the liberalism of our parents. Our goals are simple
enough to understand: we want to humanize the planet, to break down the
national structures which separate us as people, the corporate
structures which separate us into distinct classes, the racist
structures which separate us according to skin color; to conserve air,
water, life in its many forms; to create communities which are more than
habitable---communities in which people are free, in which people have
what they need, in which groups of people do not accumulate power, or
money, or goods, through the exploitation of other people. So when we
look at a sex newspaper, made by people like us, we demand that it take
some positive step in the direction we want to go: we demand that it
incorporate our radical attitudes, the knowledge that acid and other
parts of our lifestyle have given us. And, most importantly, we refuse
to permit it to reinforce the dual-role sexist patterns and
consciousness of this culture, the very patterns and consciousness which
oppress us as women, which enslave us as human beings.

Suck is a typical counter-culture sex paper. Any analysis of
it reveals that the sexism is all-pervasive, expressed primarily as
sadomasochism, absolutely the same as, and not counter to, the parent
cultural values. claims to be an ally. It is
crucial to demonstrate that it is not.

The first issue of appeared in Amsterdam,
Holland, in 1969. It continues to be printed in Amsterdam because Dutch
police do not confiscate pornography or imprison pornographers. It was
started by two Amerikan expatriates. is
entirely about sex, that is, its pages contain pornographic fiction,
technical sexual advice (how to suck cock or cunt, for instance),
letters from readers which reveal personal sexual histories (mostly
celebrational), and photographs of cunt, cock, fucking, sucking, and
group orgying. The newspaper appears irregularly ---when there is
enough 
Suck is confiscated in England and France with some
vigor.

Suck has made positive contributions. Sucking is approached
in a new way. Sucking cock, sucking cunt, how to, how good. Sperm tastes
good, so does cunt. In particular, the emphasis on sucking cunt serves
to demystify cunt in a spectacular way ---cunt is not dirty, not
terrifying, not smelly and foul; it is a source of pleasure, a beautiful
part of female physiology, to be seen, touched, tasted.

The taboo against sucking goes very deep. Most of the actual laws
against cocksucking and cuntsucking relate to prohibitions against any
sexual activity that does not lead to, or is not performed for the
purpose of effecting, impregnation. Sucking as an act leading to orgasm
places the nature of sexual contact clearly --- sex is the coming
together of people for pleasure. The value is in the coming together.
Marriage does not sanctify that coming together, procreation is not its
goal. treats sucking as an act of the same
magnitude as fucking. That attitude, pictures of women sucking cock, men
sucking cunt, and all the vice versas, discussions of the techniques of
sucking, all break down barriers to the realization of a full
sexuality.

Cunnilingus and fellatio (sucking by any other name \... ) are still
crimes. The antifellatio laws, in conjunction with sodomy laws, are
sometimes used against male homosexuals (lesbians are not taken
seriously enough to be prosecuted). Given the selective enforcement of
the laws, the shame that attaches to the forbidden acts, and the fact
that acts of oral lovemaking represented in words or in pictures are
generally deemed obscene, sucking must be seen in and of itself as an
act of political significance (which is certainly wonderful news for
depressed revolutionaries). In this instance
takes a relevant, respectable stand.

(Important digression. As late as October 1961, Lenny Bruce was
arrested because in one of his routines he used the verb "to come\" and
talked about cock-sucking. He was arrested for the
crime

> > > I was arrested for obscenity in San Francisco for using a ten

> > > for a favorite homosexual practice --- which is weird, cause I
> > > don\'t relate that word to homosexuals. It relates to any

Bruce was busted in San Francisco (obscenity), Philadelphia
(possession), Los Angeles (possession), Hollywood (obscenity), Chicago
(obscenity), and not permitted to enter England or Australia. As late as
1964 Bruce was busted for obscenity in New York City, in 1965 he was
declared a legally bankrupt pauper, and on August 3, 1966, he died in
Los Angeles. )

Suck also makes a contribution in printing pictures of cunt,
though here the praise must be severely qualified. Photos of cunt are
rare. All the rest we have seen --- siliconed tits, leering
smiles, version of pubic hair. But
having seen a remarkable movie by Anne Severson and Shelby Kennedy^2^ in
which a fixed camera catalogues the cunts of many different women, all
ages, races, with all sorts of sexual experience, one gets a
comprehension of the superficiality of the
cunt photos. Imagine a catalogue of still photos of people's faces
---the colors, textures, indentations, the unique character of each. It
is the same with cunts, and it would be fine if
Suck

Germaine Greer once wrote for she was an
editor---and her articles, the token women's articles, were sometimes
strong; her voice was always authentic. Her attempt was to bring women
into closer touch with unaltered female sexuality and place that
sexuality clearly, unapologetically, within the realm of humanity:
women, not as objects, but as human beings, truly a revolutionary
concept.

But Greer has another side which allies itself with the worst of male
chauvinism and it is that side which, I believe, made her articles
acceptable to
Suck acceptable to her. In an interview in the
Amerikan
Suck under the tide "Germaine: 'I am a Whore, ' " she
stated:

> > > Ideally, you've got to the stage where you really could ball
> > > everyone ---the fat, the blind, the foolish, the impotent, the
> > > dishonest.

> > > We have to rescue people who are already dead. We have to make
> > > love to people who are dead, and that's not easy. ^3^

Here is the ever popular notion that women, extending our role as sex
object, can humanize an atrophied world. The notion is based on a false
premise. Just as the pill was supposed to liberate women by liberating
us sexually, i. e., we could fuck as freely as men, fucking is supposed
to liberate women and men too. But the pill served to reinforce our
essential bondage ---it made us more accessible, more open to
exploitation. It did not change our basic condition because it did
nothing to challenge the sexist structure of society, not to mention
conventional sexual relationships and couplings. Neither does
promiscuity per se. Greer's alliance with the sexual revolution is,
sadly but implicitly, an alliance with male chauvinism because it does
not speak to the basic condition of women which remains the same if we
fuck one man a week, or twenty.

There is similar misunderstanding in this statement:

> > > Well, listen, this is one of the things a woman has to

Here again, the alliance is with male chauvinism, and it is
incomprehensible. Mothers fuck up people's lives in direct proportion to
how fucked up their own lives are --- that fuck up is the role they must
play, the creative possibilities they must abort. Greer surely knows
that and must speak to it. Women who walk, as opposed to those who take
taxis or drive (another relevant class distinction), are constantly
harassed, often threatened with violence, often violated. That is the
situation which is the daily life of women.

It is true, and very much to the point, that women are objects,
commodities, some deemed more expensive than others ---but it is only by
asserting one's humanness every time, in all situations, that one
becomes someone as opposed to something. That, after all, is the core of
our struggle.

Rape, of course, does have its apologists. Norman Mailer posits it,
along with murder, as the content of heroism. It is, he tells us
in, morally superior to
masturbation. Eldridge Cleaver tells us that it is an act of political
rebellion --- he "practiced" on Black women so that he could rape white
women better. Greer joins the mystifying chorus when she posits rape as
an act of aggression against property (a political anticapitalist action
no less) and suggests that it might also be an act of psychological
rebellion against the ominous, and omnipresent, mother.^\*^ Rape is, in
fact, simple straightforward heterosexual behavior in a male-dominated
society. It offends us when it does, which is rarely, only because it is
male-female relation without sham ---without the mystifying romance of
the couple, without the civility of a money exchange. It happens in the
home as well as on the streets. It is not a function of capitalism ---
it is a function of sexism.

What Greer contributes to, and to its women
readers who might look to her for cogent analysis and deep imagination,
is mostly confusion. That confusion stems from an identification with
men which too often blunts her perception of the real, empirical
problems women face in a sexist society. That confusion manifests itself
most destructively in the patently untrue notion that a woman who fucks
freely is free.

The main body of is pornographic fiction. It
is in the fiction that we find a repetition of events, situations,
images, and attitudes which most effectively reinforce conventional
sexist values. "Congo Crystal Hotel, " a story by Mel Clay, is typical
of fiction. Two men watch a pornographic
movie. They have a sadistic sexual encounter. One of the men, Beno, goes
off to meet Carol, a woman he has known previously. He forces her to
fuck and suck two Blacks, who violate her in every way. Carol's husband
intrudes. Beno forces Carol to suck her husband's cock and as her
husband comes, Beno shoots him. An example of the purple
prose:

> > > In a sudden spasm the man clutches her head and arches his back
> > > and as the beginning sensations of orgasm overtake him Beno pulls
> > > the trigger, the explosion drowning out the sound of Carol gulping
> > > on his come and his brains splashing against the ceiling.
> > > ^5^
> >
Carol is announced: "he could smell her even before he saw her. " ^6^
The rape which Beno forces on her is, of course, the vehicle of her
recognition that she loves him, because only he could do that to her.
The story contains incredible violence. Beno whips his male lover, Carol
is beaten and raped, the husband is killed. The cocks of the Blacks are,
of course, gigantic tools of pleasure and pain. There is little to
distinguish "Congo Crystal Hotel" from straight pornography, except for
the awful quality of the writing. The vision of woman is precisely the
same: insatiable cunt, to be violated and abused; the sadomasochistic
content is the same; even the exaggerated genitalia of the Blacks
participate in the worst of the pornographic tradition.

"Sex Angels, " a story by Ron Reid, chronicles the adventures of Helen
and Tony, that is, a gangbang arranged by Helen with a bunch of tough
bikers. Helen is "high class cunt who was soon to be stuffed with their
working class cocks. " ^7^ The class analysis is central to the story:
"the social gulf accentuated the mounting thrill already high with the
knowledge that the young husband was to observe his wife's gangbanging
by the pack. " ^8^ The culmination of the event, after Helen has been
thoroughly used, is described like this:

> > > now hot wet fuck tube ---hot slit, go on let see you fuck your
> > > wife now. we've all been through her. ^9^

Helen, whose resemblance to that other well-known sex object, Helen of
Troy, will not be overlooked by the acute observer, is a "hot wet fuck
tube ---hot slit. " Indeed, one must ask, in the world of
Suck

The overwhelming fact which emerges about
fiction is that it contains and expresses the traditional male
fantasies about women. Helen and Carol differ little from O and Claire.
Their needs can be articulated in precisely the same way: cock, lots of
it, all of the time, rape, violation, cruelty. If only our needs were so
simple. If only our needs had anything to do with it at all.

Men have always known, in that existential-accord-ing-to-Mailer way,
that women not only need IT but want IT, rape-brand-whip orchestrated.
It was always obvious to them ---a woman\'s "virtue" is merely facade,
her reluctance is merely tactic. What matters is that she wants to be
fucked ---she is defined by her need to be fucked. We find in
Suck these sacrosanct male fantasies applied with true
counter-culture egalitarianism: to all beings "feminine, " whether women
or gay men. Projection has come home to roost and cock is crowing like
never before ---but, like the cult of cunt before it, the cult of cock
is colored with the washes of unresolved guilt and pure sadism. The onus
and hatred of male homosexuality is heavy in Suck
---

Suck has in some ways aligned itself with the cause of gay
liberation. printed the "Gay
Guide to Europe, " a list of gay clubs, bars, pissoirs, etc., to
alleviate the chronic need for information felt by the traveling gay
man. has a story entitled "A
Week in the Fondle Park, " in which a man extols the quantity of cock
sucked in one idyllic week in Amsterdam's central park, which had been
turned over to longhaired dopers and freaks in the summer of 1971. But
in, as in the parent culture which maligns
any deviation from the ole hetero norm, the hatred attached to the queer
is very apparent.

"The Suction Game" is the story of two men, one dark-skinned, one
light-skinned, one overt, one latent --- a typical colonial situation,
ripe for exploitation. The acknowledged (overt) queer has the typical
misogynist point of view:

> > > Carlos explained that the male body was nature's perfection and
> > > how clean men were compared to women. ^10^

To the normally) self-enhancing John Wayne male, the above is
self-evident and always has been. In the context of the homosexual
encounter it has added significance. It reinforces the maleness of both
partners. It makes the homosexual act an affirmation of manhood. The
insecurities which a homosexual identity conjures up in our culture,
however, are hardly resolved through the putting down of women.
"Cocksucker" is a term of insult and abuse ---it means queer. Yet it is
obviously absurd for a man to believe that what is pleasurable to him
when done by a woman is disgusting when done by a man. The distinction
here is not so very subtle: the political meaning of the two acts,
heterosexual fellatio and homosexual fellatio, is different. The former
makes the man clearly the master ---the woman kneels at the foot of the
sheikh. The latter makes the man--- ours is
not to reason why, or is it?

Carlos (overt, dark-skinned), having unzipped the hero's pants, has
started kissing his glorious equipment:

> > > Here I was standing in this tiny YMCA room, naked as the day I
> > > was born, with a pretty boy queer, kneeling in front of me playing
> > > with my cock. The whole thing was sickening, but the worst part
> > > was that I was enjoying it\.... Suddenly I didn't give a fuck if
> > > he was queer. I just relaxed and surrendered to his sucking mouth.
> > > ^11^

The resultant orgasm is fantastic, mind-blowing, as aren't they all
in Yet the imminent slander is too much to
bear. Being sucked by a queer is one thing. Reciprocity is something
else. Could it be reciprocity that makes one queer?

> > > He was a fucking queer but I wasn't. If he had hot rock that was
> > > his problem not mine. He'll just have to find some other queer to
> > > suck his cock.^12^

Hot Rock Carlos is undaunted. After much patient persistance, our
supermale hero succumbs, with reservations: "The idea was repulsive to
me, but I wanted to make him happy. "^13^ The moral of the tale is
simple. Says our hero:

> > > Funny I do not consider myself queer, just damn lucky to be able
> > > to attract so many good looking young boys so they could have
> > > their rock inside me.^14^

Only now does the definitive definition of queer seem to emerge.
Cocksucking isn't the definitive experience after all. One must conclude
that anal intercourse, the closest corollary to female penetration,
really defines the queer. One must conclude that being fucked in the ass
separates the queers from the men and places them squarely among the
women. One must conclude that being penetrated is queer, not to mention
debasing, disgusting, and humiliating, which one had already
guessed.

Homosexual men are not only penetrated like women ---they also lust
after pain and degradation. The author of "The Suction Game" has given
us another example of homosexual pornography, this one engagingly
entitled "Tough Young Dicks for Hot Kicks. " Five young toughs are
cruising; they pick up a longhaired boy, shove him in the back seat of
the car and order him to blow them all; the boy considers refusing,
since he'd love to be beaten then and there, but instead submits since
greater abuse can always be had through submission than through
resistance; the young toughs brutally rape the long-haired boy, then
piss and shit all over him. He is, of course, ecstatic:

> > > Gee did I smell of come and teenage sweat and urine and I had two
> > > more toss-offs myself thinking about their tough young faces and
> > > dicks enjoying me for hot kicks.^15^

The stereotype of the homosexual which emerges from the general run
of fiction is not very different from the
stereotype of woman. The homosexual is queer, asshole, cocksucker,
faggot; the woman is hole, hot wet fuck tube, hot slit, or just plain
ass. He thrives on pain and so does she. Gangbanging is their mutual
joy. Huge, throbbing, monster, atom-smashing cock is god and master to
them both. The parts they play in the sadomasochistic script are the
same: so are costumes, attitudes, and other conventional cultural
baggage. It is not hard to see that the struggle for gay male liberation
and women's liberation is a common struggle: both mean freedom from the
stigma of being female. The fantasies (indicative of structural mental
sets) which oppress male homosexuals and women are very much alike.
Women and male homosexuals are united in their queerness, a union which
is real and verifiable --- affirmed by which
contributes to the cultural oppression of both.

The pages of have, sadly, nothing to do with
sexual liberation --- there is no "counter" to the culture to be found
anywhere in them. They are, instead, a catalogue of exactly those sexist
fantasies which express our most morbid psychic sets. They chart the
landscape of repression, a landscape that is surprisingly familiar. As
women, we find that we are where we have always been: the necessary
victim, there we are, the victim again; the eternal object, there we
are, the object again. Through the projection of archetypal
sadomasochistic images, which are the staple of the sexist mentality, we
become more a prisoner, robbed and cheated of any real experience or
authentic communication, thrown back into the intricate confusion of
being women in search of a usable identity.

The rapes, tortures, and violations of O, Claire, Anne,
Suck\'s Helen, et al., are fiction, documenting the twisted
landscape of male wish-fulfillment. Here we have her-story, the
underbelly of history, two acts of gynocide committed against women by
men, their scope and substance largely ignored. One is not surprised to
find that they document that same twisted landscape.

I isolate in particular Chinese footbinding and the persecution of the
witches because they are crimes which equal in sheer horror and sadism
the extermination of Native Americans and Hitler's massacre of the Jews.
Those two horrendous slaughters have found a place, however tenuous, in
the "conscience" of "man. " Acts of genocide against women have barely
been noticed, and they have never evoked rage, or horror, or sorrow.
That sexist hatred equals racist hatred in its intensity, irrationality,
and contempt for the sanctity of human life these two examples clearly
demonstrate. That women have not been exterminated, and will not be (at
least until the technology of creating life in the laboratory is
perfected) can be attributed to our presumed ability to bear children
and, more importantly no doubt, to the relative truth that
men prefer to fuck cunts who are nominally alive. I except here
necrophili-acs, those pure and unsullied princes, whose story begins
where ours
ends.

In addition, in any war, in any violence between tribes or nations, a
specific war crime is perpetrated against women ---that of rape. Every
woman raped during a political nation-state war is the victim of a much
larger war, planetary in its dimensions ---the war, more declared than
we can bear to know, that men wage against women. That war had its most
gruesome, grotesque expression when Chinese men bound the feet of
Chinese women and when British, Welsh, Irish, Scottish, German, Dutch,
French, Swiss, Italian, Spanish, and Amerikan men had women burned at
the stake in the name of God the Father and His only Son.

CHAPTER 6

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Gynocide: Chinese Footbinding**

The origins of Chinese footbinding, as of Chinese thought in general,
belong to that amorphous entity called antiquity. The 10th century marks
the beginning of the physical, intellectual, and spiritual
dehumanization of women in China through the institution of footbinding.
That institution itself, the implicit belief in its necessity and
beauty, and the rigor with which it was practiced lasted another 10
centuries. There were sporadic attempts at emancipating the foot ---some
artists, intellectuals, and women in positions of power were the
proverbial drop in the bucket. Those attempts, modest though they were,
were doomed to failure footbinding was a political institution which
reflected and perpetuated the sociological and psychological inferiority
of women; footbinding cemented women to a certain sphere, with a certain
function ---women were sexual objects and breeders. Footbinding was mass
attitude, mass culture ---it was the key reality in a way of life lived
by real women---10 centuries times that many millions of them.

It is generally thought that footbinding originated as an innovation
among the dancers of the Imperial harem. Sometime between the 9th and
11th centuries, Emperor Li Yu ordered a favorite ballerina to achieve
the "pointed look. " The fairy tale reads like this:

> > > Li Yu had a favored palace concubine named Lovely Maiden who was
> > > a slender-waisted beauty and a gifted dancer. He had a six-foot
> > > high lotus constructed for her out of gold; it was decorated
> > > lavishly with pearls and had a carmine lotus carpet in the center.
> > > Lovely Maiden was ordered to bind her feet with white silk cloth
> > > to make the tips look like the points of a moon sickle. She then
> > > danced in the center of the lotus, whirling about like a rising
> > > cloud. ^1^

From this original event, the bound foot received the euphemism "Golden
Lotus, " though it is clear that Lovely Maiden's feet were bound
loosely--- she could still dance.

A later essayist, a true foot gourmand, described 58 varieties of the
human lotus, each one graded on a 9-point scale. For example:

> > > Type: Lotus petal, New moon,
> > > Harmonious bow, Bamboo shoot, Water chestnut\
> > > **Specifications:** plumpness, softness, fineness\
> > > **Rank: **

> > > Divine Quality (A-1), perfectly plump, soft and fine\
> > > Wondrous Quality (A-2), weak and slender\
> > > Immortal Quality (A-3), straight-boned, independent\
> > > Precious Article (B-1), peacocklike, too wide, dis-proportioned\
> > > Pure Article (B-2), gooselike, too long and thin\
> > > Seductive Article (B-3), fleshy, short, wide, round (the
> > > disadvantage of this foot was that its owner could withstand a
> > > blowing wind)\
> > > Excessive Article (C-1), narrow but insufficiently pointed\
> > > Ordinary Article (C-2), plump and common\
> > > False Article (C-3), monkeylike large heel (could
> > > climb)

The distinctions only emphasize that footbinding was a rather hazardous
operation. To break the bones involved or to modify the pressure of the
bindings irregularly had embarrassing consequences --- no girl could
bear the ridicule involved in being called a "largefooted Demon" and the
shame of being unable to marry.

Even the possessor of an A-1 Golden Lotus could not rest on her laurels
---she had to observe scrupulously the taboo-ridden etiquette of bound
femininity: (1) do not walk with toes pointed upwards; (2) do not stand
with heels seemingly suspended in midair; (3) do not move skirt when
sitting; (4) do not move feet when lying down. The same essayist
concludes his treatise with this most sensible advice (directed to the
gentlemen of course):

> > > Do not remove the bindings to look at her bare
> > > feet, but be satisfied with its external appearance.
> > > Enjoy
> > > the outward
> > > impression, for if you remove the shoes and bindings the aesthetic
> > > feeling will be destroyed forever.
> > > ^2^

Indeed. The real feet looked like this:

!(Images/main-5.png)

(feet: 3 to 4 inches in length)

The physical process which created this foot is described by Howard S.
Levy in Chinese Footbinding: The History of a Curious Erotic
Custom:

> > > The success or failure of footbinding depended on skillful
> > > application of a bandage around each foot. The bandage, about two
> > > inches wide and ten feet long, was wrapped in the
> > > following way. One end was placed on the inside of the instep, and
> > > from there it was carried over the small toes so as to force the
> > > toes in and towards the sole. The large toe was left unbound. The
> > > bandage was then wrapped around the heel so forcefully that heel
> > > and toes were drawn closer together. The process was then repeated
> > > from the beginning until the entire bandage had been applied. The
> > > foot of the young child was subjected to a coercive and
> > > unremitting pressure, for the object was not merely to confine the
> > > foot but to make the toes bend under and into the sole and bring
> > > the heel and sole as close together as physically possible.
> > > ^3^

A Christian missionary observed:

> > > The flesh often became putrescent during the binding and portions
> > > sloughed off from the sole; sometimes one or more toes dropped
> > > off. ^4^

An elderly Chinese woman, as late as 1934, remembered vividly her
childhood experience:

> > > Born into an old-fashioned family at P'ing-hsi, I was inflicted
> > > with the pain of footbinding when I was seven years old. I was an
> > > active child who liked to jump about, but from then on my free and

Bound feet were crippled and excruciatingly painful. The woman was
actually "walking" on the outside of toes which had been bent under into
the sole of the foot. The heel and instep of the foot resembled the sole
and heel of a high-heeled boot. Hard callouses formed; toenails grew
into the skin; the feet were pus-filled and bloody; circulation was
virtually stopped. The foot-bound woman hobbled along, leaning on a
cane, against a wall, against a servant. To keep her balance she took
very short steps. She was actually falling with every step and catching
herself with the next. Walking required tremendous exertion.

Footbinding also distorted the natural lines of the female body. It
caused the thighs and buttocks, which were always in a state of tension,
to become somewhat swollen (which men called "voluptuous"). A curious
belief developed among Chinese men that footbinding produced a most
useful alteration of the vagina. A Chinese diplomat explained:

> > > The smaller the woman's foot, the more wondrous become the folds
> > > of the vagina. (There was the saying: the smaller the feet, the
> > > more intense the sex urge. ) Therefore marriages in Ta-t'ung
> > > (where binding is most effective) often take place earlier than
> > > elsewhere. Women in other districts can produce these folds
> > > artificially, but the only way is by footbinding, which
> > > concentrates development in this one place. There consequently
> > > develop layer after layer (of folds within the vagina); those who
> > > have personally experienced this (in sexual intercourse) feel a
> > > supernatural exaltation. So the system of footbinding was not
> > > really oppressive. ^6^

Medical authorities confirm that physiologically footbinding had no
effect whatsoever on the vagina, although it did distort the direction
of the pelvis. The belief in the wondrous folds of the vagina of
footbound woman was pure mass delusion, a projection of lust onto the
feet, buttocks, and vagina of the crippled female. Needless to say, the
diplomat's rationale for finding footbinding "not really oppressive"
confused his "supernatural exaltation" with her misery and
mutilation.

Bound feet, the same myth continues, "made the buttocks more sensual,
\and\ concentrated life-giving vapors on the upper part of the body,
making the face more attractive. "^7^ If, due to a breakdown in the flow
of these "life-giving vapors, " an ugly woman was foot-bound and still
ugly, she need not despair, for an A-1 Golden Lotus could
compensate for a C-3 face and
figure.

But to return to herstory, how did our Chinese ballerina become the
millions of women stretched over 10 centuries? The transition
from palace dancer to population at large can be seen as part of a class
dynamic. The emperor sets the style, the nobility copies it, and the
lower classes climbing ever upward do their best to emulate it. The
upper class bound the feet of their ladies with the utmost severity. The
Lady, unable to walk, remained properly invisible in her boudoir, an
ornament, weak and small, a testimony to the wealth and privilege of the
man who could afford to keep her--- to keep her idle. Doing no manual
labor, she did not need her feet either. Only on the rarest of occasions
was she allowed outside of the incarcerating walls of her home, and then
only in a sedan chair behind heavy curtains. The lower a woman's class,
the less could such idleness be supported: the larger the feet. The
women who had to work for the economic survival of the family still had
bound feet, but the bindings were looser, the feet bigger---after all,
she had to be able to walk, even if slowly and with little
balance.

Footbinding was a visible brand. Footbinding did not
emphasize the differences between men and women ---it created
them, and they were then perpetuated in the name of morality.
Footbinding functioned as the Cerberus of morality and ensured female
chastity in a nation of women who literally could not "run around. "
Fidelity, and the legitimacy of children, could be reckoned
on.

The minds of footbound women were as contracted as their
feet. Daughters were taught to cook, supervise the household, and
embroider shoes for the Golden Lotus. Intellectual and physical
restriction had the usual male justification. Women were perverse and
sinful, lewd and lascivious, if left to develop naturally. The Chinese
believed that being born a woman was payment for evils committed in a
previous life. Footbinding was designed to spare a woman the disaster of
another such
incarnation.

Marriage and the family are the twin pillars of all patriarchal
cultures. Bound feet, in China, were the twin pillars of these twin
pillars. Here we have the joining together of politics and morality,
coupled to produce their inevitable offspring---the oppression of women
based on totalitarian standards of beauty and a rampant sexual fascism.
In arranging a marriage, a male\'s parents inquired first about the
prospective bride's feet, then about her face. Those were her human,
recognizable qualities. During the process of footbinding, mothers
consoled their daughters by conjuring up the luscious marriage
possibilities dependent on the beauty of the bound foot. Concubines for
the Imperial harem were selected at tiny-foot festivals (forerunners of
Miss America pageants). Rows upon rows of women sat on benches with
their feet outstretched while audience and judges went along the aisles
and commented on the size, shape, and decoration of foot and shoes. No
one, however, was ever allowed to touch the merchandise. Women looked
forward to these festivals, since they were allowed out of the
house.

The sexual aesthetics, literally the art of love, of the
bound foot was complex. The sexual attraction of the foot was based on
its concealment and the mystery surrounding its development and care.
The bindings were unwrapped and the feet were washed in the woman's
boudoir, in the strictest privacy. The frequency of bathing varied from
once a week to once a year. Perfumes of various fragrances and alum were
used during and after washing, and various kinds of surgery were
performed on the callouses and nails. The physical process of washing
helped restore circulation. The mummy was unwrapped, touched up, and put
back to sleep with more preservatives added. The rest of the body was
never washed at the same time as the feet, for fear that one would
become a pig in the next life. Well-bred women were supposed to die of
shame if men observed them washing their feet. The foot consisted, after
all, of smelly, rotted flesh. This was naturally not pleasing to the
intruding male, a violation of his aesthetic
sensibility.

The art of the shoes was basic to the sexual aesthetics of the bound
foot. Untold hours, days, months went into the embroidery of shoes.
There were shoes for all occasions, shoes of different colors, shoes to
hobble in, shoes to go to bed in, shoes for special occasions like
birthdays, marriages, funerals, shoes which denoted age. Red was the
favored color for bed shoes because it accentuated the whiteness of the
skin of the calves and thighs. A marriageable daughter made about 12
pairs of shoes as a part of her dowry. She presented 2 specially made
pairs to her mother-in-law and father-in-law. When she entered her
husband's home for the first time, her feet were immediately
examined by the whole family, neither praise nor sarcasm being
withheld.

There was also the art of the gait, the art of sitting, the art of
standing, the art of lying down, the art of adjusting the skirt, the art
of every movement which involves feet. Beauty was the way feet looked
and how they moved. Certain feet were better than other feet, more
beautiful. Perfect 3-inch form and utter uselessness were the
distinguishing marks of the aristocratic foot. These concepts of beauty
and status defined women: as ornaments, as sexual playthings, as sexual
constructs. The perfect construct, even in China, was naturally the
prostitute.

The natural-footed woman generated horror and repulsion in China. She
was anathema, and all the forces of insult and contempt were used to
obliterate her. Men said about bound feet and natural feet:

> > > A tiny foot is proof of feminine goodness\....
>
> > > Women who don't bind their feet, look like men, for the tiny foot

Thin, small, curved, soft, fragrant, weak, easily inflamed, passive to
the point of being almost inanimate---this was footbound woman. Her
bindings created extraordinary vaginal folds; isolation in the bedroom
increased her sexual desire; playing with the shriveled, crippled foot
increased everyone's desire. Even the imagery of the names of various
types of foot suggest, on the one hand, feminine passivity (lotuses,
lilies, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts) and, on the other hand, male
independence, strength, and mobility (lotus boats, large-footed crows,
monkey foot). It was unacceptable for a woman to have those male
qualities denoted by large feet. This fact conjures up an earlier
assertion: footbinding did not formalize existing differences between
men and women ---it created them. One sex became male by virtue of
having made the other sex some thing, something other, something
completely polar to itself, something called female. In 1915, a
satirical essay in defense of footbinding, written by a Chinese male,
emphasized this:

Chinese men, it is clear, stood tall and strong on women's tiny
feet.

The so-called art of footbinding was the process of taking the human
foot, using it as though it were insensible matter, molding it into an
inhuman form. Footbinding was the "art" of making living matter
insensible, inanimate. We are obviously not dealing here with art at
all, but with fetishism, with sexual psychosis. This fetish became the
primary content of sexual experience for an entire culture for 1,000
years. The manipulation of the tiny foot was an indispensable prelude to
all sexual experience. Manuals were written elaborating various
techniques for holding and rubbing the Golden Lotus. Smelling the feet,
chewing them, licking them, sucking them, all were sexually charged
experiences. A woman with tiny feet was supposedly more easily
maneuvered around in bed and this was no small advantage. Theft of shoes
was commonplace. Women were forced to sew their shoes directly onto
their bindings. Stolen shoes might be returned soaked in semen.
Prostitutes would show their naked feet for a high price (there weren't
many streetwalkers in China). Drinking games using cups placed in the
shoes of prostitutes or courtesans were favorite pastimes. Tiny-footed
prostitutes took special names like Moon Immortal, Red Treasure, Golden
Pearl. No less numerous were the euphemisms for feet, shoes, and
bindings. Some men went to prostitutes to wash the tiny foot and eat its
dirt, or to drink tea made from the washing water. Others wanted their
penises manipulated by the feet. Superstition also had its place
---there was a belief in the curative powers of the water in which tiny
feet were washed.

Lastly, footbinding was the soil in which sadism could grow and go
unchecked ---in which simple cruelty could transcend itself, without
much effort, into atrocity. These are some typical horror stories of
those times:

END OF FOOTBINDING EVENT

One asks the same questions again and again, over a period of years, in
the course of a lifetime. The questions have to do with people and what
they do ---the how and the why of it. How could the Germans have
murdered 6, 000, 000 Jews, used their skins for lampshades, taken the
gold out of their teeth? How could white people have bought and sold
black people, hanged them and castrated them? How could "Americans" have
slaughtered the Indian nations, stolen the land, spread famine and
disease? How can the Indochina genocide continue, day after day, year
after year? How is it possible? Why does it happen?

As a woman, one is forced to ask another series of hard questions: Why
everywhere the oppression of women throughout recorded history? How
could the Inquisitors torture and burn women as witches? How
could men idealize the bound feet of crippled women? How and
why?

The bound foot existed for 1,000 years. In what terms, using what
measure, could one calculate the enormity of the crime, the dimensions
of the transgression, the of cruelty and
pain inherent in that 1, 000-year herstory? In what terms, using what
vocabulary, could one penetrate to the meaning, to the reality, of that
1,000-year herstory?

Here one race did not war with another to acquire food, or land, or
civil power; one nation did not fight with another in the interest of
survival, real or imagined; one group of people in a fever pitch of
hysteria did not destroy another. None of the traditional explanations
or justifications for brutality between or among peoples applies to this
situation. On the contrary, here one sex mutilated (enslaved) the other
in the interest of the of sex,
male-female, role-definition,
beauty.

Consider the magnitude of the crime.

Millions of women, over a period of 1,000 years, were brutally
crippled, mutilated, in the name of erotica.

Millions of human beings, over a period of 1, 000 years, were brutally
crippled, mutilated, in the name of beauty.

Millions of men, over a period of 1, 000 years, reveled in love-making
devoted to the worship of the bound foot.

Millions of men, over a period of 1, 000 years, worshiped and adored
the bound foot.

Millions of mothers, over a period of 1, 000 years, brutally crippled
and mutilated their daughters for the sake of a secure
marriage.

Millions of mothers, over a period of 1, 000 years, brutally crippled
and mutilated their daughters in the name of beauty.

But this thousand-year period is only the tip of an awesome, fearful
iceberg: an extreme and visible expression of romantic attitudes,
processes, and values organically rooted in all cultures, then and now.
It demonstrates that man's love for woman, his sexual adoration of her,
his human definition of her, his delight and pleasure in her, require
her negation: physical crippling and psychological lobotomy. That is the
very nature of romantic love, which is the love based on polar role
definitions, manifest in herstory as well as in fiction ---he glories in
her agony, he adores her deformity, he annihilates her freedom, he will
have her as sex object, even if he must destroy the bones in her feet to
do it. Brutality, sadism, and oppression emerge as the substantive core
of the romantic ethos. That ethos is the warp and woof of culture as we
know it.

Women should be beautiful. All repositories of cultural wisdom from
King Solomon to King Hefner agree: women should be beautiful. It is the
reverence for female beauty which informs the romantic ethos, gives it
its energy and justification. Beauty is transformed into that golden
ideal, Beauty ---rapturous and abstract. Women must be beautiful and
Woman is Beauty.

Notions of beauty always incorporate the whole of a given societal
structure, are crystallizations of its values. A society with a
well-defined aristocracy will have aristocratic standards of beauty. In
Western "democracy" notions of beauty are "democratic": even if a woman
is not born beautiful, she can make herself
*attractive*.

The argument is not simply that some women are not beautiful, therefore
it is not fair to judge women on the basis of physical beauty; or that
men are not judged on that basis, therefore women also should not be
judged on that basis; or that men should look for character in women; or
that our standards of beauty are too parochial in and of themselves; or
even that judging women according to their conformity to a standard of
beauty serves to make them into products, chattels, differing from the
farmer\'s favorite cow only in terms of literal form. The issue at stake
is different, and crucial. Standards of beauty describe in precise terms
the relationship that an individual will have to her own body. They
prescribe her mobility, spontaneity, posture, gait, the uses to which
she can put her body. *They define precisely the dimensions
of her physical freedom.* And, of course, the relationship
between physical freedom and psychological development, intellectual
possibility, and creative potential is an umbilical one.

In our culture, not one part of a woman's body is left untouched,
unaltered. No feature or extremity is spared the art, or pain, of
improvement. Hair is dyed, lacquered, straightened, permanented;
eyebrows are plucked, penciled, dyed; eyes are lined, mascaraed,
shadowed; lashes are curled, or false ---from head to toe, every feature
of a woman\'s face, every section of her body, is subject to
modification, alteration. This alteration is an ongoing, repetitive
process. It is vital to the economy, the major substance of male-female
role differentiation, the most immediate physical and psychological
reality of being a woman. From the age of 11 or 12 until she
dies, a woman will spend a large part of her time, money, and energy on
binding, plucking, painting, and deodorizing herself. It is commonly and
wrongly said that male transvestites through the use of makeup and
costuming caricature the women they would become, but any real knowledge
of the romantic ethos makes clear that these men have penetrated to the
core experience of being a woman, a romanticized
construct.

The technology of beauty, and the message it carries, is handed down
from mother to daughter. Mother teaches daughter to apply lipstick, to
shave under her arms, to bind her breasts, to wear a girdle and
high-heeled shoes. Mother teaches daughter concomitantly her role, her
appropriate behavior, her place. Mother teaches daughter, necessarily,
the psychology which defines womanhood: a woman must be beautiful, in
order to please the amorphous and amorous Him. What we have called the
romantic ethos operates as vividly in 20th-century Amerika and Europe as
it did in 10th-century China.

This cultural transfer of technology, role, and psychology virtually
affects the emotive relationship between mother and daughter. It
contributes substantially to the ambivalent love-hate dynamic of that
relationship. What must the Chinese daughter/child have felt toward the
mother who bound her feet? What does any daughter/child feel toward the
mother who forces her to do painful things to her own body? The mother
takes on the role of enforcer: she uses seduction, command, all manner
of force to coerce the daughter to conform to the demands of the
culture. It is because this role becomes her dominant role in the
mother-daughter relationship that tensions and difficulties between
mothers and daughters are so often unresolvable. The daughter who
rejects the cultural norms enforced by the mother is forced to a basic
rejection of her own mother, a recognition of the hatred and resentment
she felt toward that mother, an alienation from mother and society so
extreme that her own womanhood is denied by both. The daughter who
internalizes those values and endorses those same processes is bound to
repeat the teaching she was taught ---her anger and resentment remain
subterranean, channeled against her own female offspring as well as her
mother.

Pain is an essential part of the grooming process, and that is not
accidental. Plucking the eyebrows, shaving under the arms, wearing a
girdle, learning to walk in high-heeled shoes, having one's nose fixed,
straightening or curling one's hair ---these things
hurt. The pain, of course, teaches an important lesson: no
price is too great, no process too repulsive, no operation too painful
for the woman who would be beautiful. The tolerance of pain
and the romanticization of that tolerance begins here, in
preadolescence, in socialization, and serves to prepare women for lives
of childbearing, self-abnegation, and husband-pleasing. The adolescent
experience of the "pain of being a woman" casts the feminine psyche into
a masochistic mold and forces the adolescent to conform to a self-image
which bases itself on mutilation of the body, pain happily suffered, and
restricted physical mobility. It creates the masochistic personalities
generally found in adult women: subservient, materialistic (since all
value is placed on the body and its ornamentation), intellectually
restricted, creatively impoverished. It forces women to be a sex of
lesser accomplishment, weaker, as underdeveloped as any backward nation.
Indeed, the effects of that prescribed relationship between women and
their bodies are so extreme, so deep, so extensive, that scarcely any
area of human possibility is left untouched by it.

Men, of course, like a woman who "takes care of herself. " The male
response to the woman who is made-up and bound is a learned fetish,
societal in its dimensions. One need only refer to the male idealization
of the bound foot and say that the same dynamic is operating here.
Romance based on role differentiation, superiority based on a culturally
determined and rigidly enforced inferiority, shame and guilt and fear of
women and sex itself: all necessitate the perpetuation of these
oppressive grooming imperatives.

The meaning of this analysis of the romantic ethos surely is clear. A
first step in the process of liberation (women from their oppression,
men from the unfreedom of their fetishism) is the radical redefining of
the relationship between women and their bodies. The body must be freed,
liberated, quite literally: from paint and girdles and all varieties of
crap. Women must stop mutilating their bodies and start living in them.
Perhaps the notion of beauty which will then organically emerge will be
truly democratic and demonstrate a respect for human life in its
infinite, and most honorable, variety.

**Gynocide: The Witches**

Malleus Maleficarum

It would be hard to give an idea of how dark the Dark Ages actually
were. "Dark" barely serves to describe the social and intellectual gloom
of those centuries. The learning of the classical world was in a state
of eclipse. The wealth of that same world fell into the hands of the
Catholic Church and assorted monarchs, and the only democracy the
landless masses of serfs knew was a democratic distribution of poverty.
Disease was an even crueler exacter than the Lord of the Manor. The
medieval Church did not believe that cleanliness was next to godliness.
On the contrary, between the temptations of the flesh and the Kingdom of
Heaven, a layer of dirt, lice, and vermin was supposed to afford
protection and to ensure virtue. Since the flesh was by definition
sinful, it was not to be uncovered, washed, or treated for those
diseases which were God's punishment in the first place --- hence the
Church's hostility to the practice of medicine and to the search for
medical knowledge. Abetted by this medieval predilection for filth and
shame, successive epidemics of leprosy, epileptic
convulsions, and plague decimated the population of Europe
regularly. The Black Death is thought to have killed
25 percent of the entire population of Europe; two-thirds to
one-half of the population of France died; in some towns every living
person died; in London it is estimated that one person in ten
survived:

> > On Sundays, after Mass, the sick came in scores, crying for help
> > and words were all they got: You have sinned, and God is afflicting
> > you. Thank Him: you will suffer so much the less torment in the life
> > to come. Endure, suffer, die. Has not the Church its prayers for the
> > dead. ^1^
>
Hunger and misery, the serf's constant companions, may well have
induced the kinds of hallucinations and hysteria which profound
ignorance translated as demonic possession. Disease, social chaos,
peasant insurrections, outbreaks of dancing mania (tarantism) with its
accompanying mass flagellation --- the Church had to explain these
obvious evils. What kind of Shepherd was this whose flock was so cruelly
and regularly set upon? Surely the hell-fires and eternal damnation
which were vivid in the Christian imagination were modeled on daily
experience, on real earth-lived life.

The Christian notion of the nature of the Devil underwent as many
transformations as the snake has skins. In this evolution, natural
selection played a determining role as the Church bred into its
conception those deities best suited to its particular brand of
dualistic theology. It is a cultural constant that the gods of one
religion become the devils of the next, and the Church, intolerant of
deviation in this as in all other areas, vilified the gods of those
pagan religions which threatened Catholic supremacy in Europe until at
least the 15th century. The pagan religions were not monotheistic and
their pantheons were scarcely conservative in number. The Church had a
slew of deities to dispatch and would have done so speedily had not the
old gods their faithful adherents who clung to the old practices, who
had local power, who had to be pacified. Accordingly, the Church did a
kind of roulette and sent some gods to heaven (canonizing them) and
others to hell (damning them). Especially in southern Europe the local
deities, formerly housed on Olympus, were allowed to continue their
traditional vocations of healing the sick and protecting the traveler.
The Church often transformed the names of the gods ---so as not to be
embarrassed, no doubt. Apollo, for instance, became St. Apollinaris;
Cupid became St. Valentine. The pagan gods were also allowed to retain
their favorite haunts --- shrines, trees, wells, burial grounds, now
newly decorated with a cross.

But in northern Europe the old gods did not fare as well. The peoples
of northern Europe were temperamentally and culturally quite different
from the Latin Christians, and their religions centered around animal
totemism and fertility rites. The "heathens" adhered to a primitive
animism. They worshiped nature (archenemy of the Church), which was
manifest in spirits who inhabited stones, rivers, and trees. In the
paleolithic hunting stage, they were concerned with magical control of
animals. In the later neolithic agricultural stage, fertility practices
to ensure the food supply predominated.

**Gynocide: The Witches**

Anthropologists now believe that man's first representation of any
anthropomorphic deity is that of a horned figure who wears a stag's head
and is apparently dancing. That figure is to be found in a cavern in
Ar-riege. Early religions actively worshiped animals, and in particular
animals which symbolized male fertility---the bull, goat, or stag.
Ecstatic dancing, feasts, sacrifice of the god or his representative
(human or animal) were parts of the rites. The magician-priest-shaman
became the earthly incarnation of the god-animal and apparently dressed
in the skins of the sacred animal (even the Pharaoh of Egypt had an
animal tail attached to his girdle). There he stood, replete with horns
and hooves---the primitive deity, attributes of him echoing in the later
deities Osiris, Isis, Hathor, Pan, and Janus. His worship was
assimilated into the phallic worship of the northern sky-thunder-warrior
gods (the influence of which can be seen in Druidic practices). These
pagan rites and deities maintained their divinity in the mass psyche
despite all of the Church's attempts to blacklist them. Some kings of
England were converted by the missionaries, only to revert to the old
faith when the missionaries left. Others maintained two altars, one
devoted to Christ, one to the horned god. The peasants never played
politics---they clung to the fertility-magic beliefs. Until the 10th
century, the Church protested this willful "devil worship" but could do
nothing but issue proclamations, impose penances and fasts, and, of
course, carry on the unending struggle against nature and the
flesh.

This was a serious business, for the end of the world was believed to
be imminent. For good Christians, preparations to depart this earthly
abode included renunciation of all hedonistic activities (eating,
dancing, fucking, etc. ). St. Simon Stylites, in his attempt to avoid
the crime of being human, fled to the desert where he erected a pillar
on which he mortified his flesh for most of his 72 years. He was tempted
throughout by visions of lascivious women. Indeed, it required
starvation, incessant prayer, and flagellation to be visited by
lascivious women in those days and still lead the perfect Christian
life.

The extremeness of the Church\'s ascetic imperatives invited a
reciprocal debauchery. The nobility, when not out butchering, enforced
that most curious of customs, the jus primae
noctis, which legitimated the rape of newly wed peasant
women. The Crusaders brought back spices and syphilis from the East
---that summing up their knowledge of Arab culture. The clergy was so
openly corrupt and sensual that successive popes were forced to
acknowledge it. "By 1102 a church council had to state specifically that
priests should be degraded for sodomy and anathematized for \'obstinate
sodomy. \' "^2^ Bishops and cardinals were also known to fuck around: "A
typical example is that Bishop of Toul \... whose favorite concubine was
his own daughter by a nun of Epinal.\"^3^ The monasteries and cloisters
were rampant with homosexuality, but nuns and monks did occasionally get
together for heterosexual fucking.

Until the 12th century, there were basically three kinds of
relationship to the Church. There were the ascetics who fled the cities
to roam like beasts in the wilderness and emulated St. Simon, who made a
pig-sty his home when not on the pillar. The ascetics mortified the
flesh while awaiting cataclysmic destruction and eternal resurrection.
There were the nobility, the clergy, and the soldiers, who delighted in
carnal excesses of every sort, and the serfs who went on breeding
because it was their only outlet and because the nobles encouraged
increases in the number of tenants. The last group, crucial to this
period, were the heretics. In the 12th century various groups, viewing
the abominations of Christianity with increasing horror, began to voice
openly and even loudly their skepticism. These sects played a prominent
role in shaping the Church's idea of the Devil.

The Waldenses, Manicheans, and Cathari were the principal heretical
sects. It is said that "the Waldenses were burnt for the practices for
which the Franciscans were later canonized. " ^4^ Their crime was to
expose and to mock the clergy as frauds. For their piety they suffered
the fate of all heretics, which was burning. More influential and more
dangerous were the Manicheans, who traced their origins to the Persian
Mani who had been crucified in a. d.{.font12
style="font-weight:bold;"} 276. The Manicheans worshiped one God, who
incorporated both good and evil, the ancient Zoroastrian idea. The
Cathari, who were equally maligned by the Christians, also worshiped the
dual principle:

> > \... the chief outstanding quality of the Cathari was their piety
> > and charity. They were divided into two sections: the ordinary lay
> > believers and the Perfecti, who believed in complete abstinence and
> > even the logical end of all asceticism --- the Endura ---a
> > passionate disavowal of physical humanity which led them to
> > starvation and even apparently to mass suicide. They adopted most of
> > the Christian teaching and dogma of the New Testament, mixed with
> > Gnostic ritual, using asceticism as an end to visions and

> > orgies and sacrilege, and burned, and scourged, and harried.
> > Nevertheless the heresy flourished, and Cathari were able to hold
> > conferences on equal terms with orthodox bishops. ^5^
>
The Holy Inquisition, in its infancy, exterminated the Cathari, tried
to exterminate the Jews, and then went on to exterminate the Knights
Templars, the Christian organization of knighthood and conquest which
had become too powerful and wealthy. It had become independent of clergy
and kings, and had thereby incurred the wrath of both. With these
experiences under its expanding belt, the Inquisition in the 15th
century turned to the persecution of those most heinous of all heretics,
the witches, that is, to all of those who still clung to the old cult
beliefs of pagan Europe.

The Manicheans and Cathari had, in order to account for the existence
of good and evil (the thorniest of theological problems), worshiped good
and evil both. The Catholics, not able to accept that solution,
developed a complex theology concerning the relationship between God and
the Devil, now called Satan, which rested on the weird idea that Satan
was limited in some specific ways, but very marvelous, all of his
machinations, curses, and damnations being "by God's permission" and a
testimony to God's divine majesty. Here we have the Catholic version of
double-double think. Through the processes of Aristotle's famous logic,
as adapted by St. Thomas Aquinas, which was the basis of Catholic
theology, it now became clear that not to believe in the literal
existence of Satan was tantamount to atheism. The evil principle,
articulated by the Manicheans and Cathari, was absorbed into
Catholicism, along with the horned figure of the old pagan cults, to
produce the horned, clawed, sulphurous, black, fire and brimstone Satan
of the medieval Christian iconographers.

Later Calvin and Luther also made their contributions. Luther had more
personal contact with Satan than any man before or since. He proclaimed
Satan "Prince" of this earthly realm and considered all earthly
experiences under his domination. Luther and Calvin agreed that good
works no longer counted ---only divine grace for the elect was
sufficient to ensure entrance into the Kingdom of God. Thus Reformation
Protestantism obliterated the small measure of hope that even
Catholicism offered. Calvin himself was a voracious witch hunter and
burner.

Although the Protestants contributed without modesty and with great
enthusiasm to the witch terror, we find the origins of the actual,
organized persecutions, not unexpectedly, in the Bull of Innocent VIII,
issued December 9, 1484. The Pope named Heinrich Kramer and James
Sprenger as Inquisitors and asked them to define witchcraft, describe
the of witches, and standardize
trial procedures and sentencing. The papal Bull reversed the Church's
previous position, which had been formulated by a synod in A.
D.

> > \... if somebody, deceived by the devil, following the custom of
> > the heathen, believes that some man or woman, is a striga who eats
> > men, and for that reason burns her or gives her flesh to eat, or
> > eats it, he is to be punished by death. ^6^
>
The Church had accordingly for 7 centuries considered the belief in
witchcraft a heathen belief and the burning of alleged witches a capital
crime. Pope Innocent, however, secure in papal infallibility and
demonstrating a true political sensibility (leading to the consolidation
of power), described the extent of his concern:

> > It has indeed lately come to Our ears, not without afflicting Us
> > with bitter sorrow, that in some parts of Northern Germany, as well
> > as in the provinces, townships, territories, districts, and dioceses
> > of Mainz, Cologne, Treves, Saltzburg, and Bremen, many persons of

> > succubi \female\, and by their incantations, spells,
> > conjurations, and other accursed charms and crafts, enormities and
> > horrid offenses, have slain infants yet in the mother\'s womb, as

> > the grapes of the vine, the fruit of the trees, nay, men and women,
> > beasts of burthen, herd beasts, as well as animals of other kinds,
> > vineyards, orchards, meadows, pastureland, corn, wheat, and all
> > other cereals; these wretches furthermore afflict and torment men

To deal with the increasing tide of witchcraft and in conformity with
the Pope's orders, Sprenger and Kramer collaborated on the
Malleus Maleficarum. This document, a monument to Aristode's
logic and academic methodology (quoting and footnoting "authorities"),
catalogues the major concerns of 15th-century Catholic
theology:

The also describes the ritual and content
of witchcraft per se, though in the tradition of paternalism indigenous
to the Church, Sprenger and Kramer are careful not to give formulae for
charms or other dangerous information. They write "of the several
Methods by which Devils through Witches Entice and Allure the Innocent
to the Increase of that Horrid Craft and company"; "of the Way whereby a
Formal Pact with Evil is made"; "How they are Transported from Place to
Place"; "Here follows the Way whereby Witches copulate with those Devils
known as Incubi, " ^9^ etc. They document how witches injure cattle,
cause hailstorms and tempests, illnesses in people and animals, bewitch
men, change themselves into animals, change animals into people, commit
acts of cannibalism and murder. The main concern of the
Malleus is with natural events, nature, the real dynamic
world which refused to conform to Catholic doctrine ---the
Malleus, with tragic wrong-headedness, explains most aspects
of biology, sexology, medicine, and weather in terms of the
demonic.

Before we approach the place of women in this most Christian piece of
Western history, the importance of the
itself must be understood. In the Dark Ages, few people read and books
were hard to come by. Yet the was printed
in numerous editions. It was found in every courtroom. It had
been read by every judge, each of whom would know it chapter and verse.
The had more currency than the Bible. It
was theology, it was law. To disregard it, to challenge its authority
("seemingly inexhaustible wells of wisdom," ^10^ wrote Montague Summers
in, the year I was born) was to commit
heresy, a capital crime.

Although statistical information on the witchcraft persecutions is very
incomplete, there are judicial records extant for particular towns and
areas which are accurate:

It is estimated that at least 1,000 were executed in England, and the
Scottish, Welsh, and Irish were even fiercer in their purges. It is hard
to arrive at a figure for the whole of the Continent and the British
Isles, but the most responsible estimate would seem to be
9 It may well, some authorities contend,
have been more. Nine million seems almost moderate when one realizes
that The Blessed Reichhelm of Schongan at the end of the 13th century
computed the number of the Devil-driven to be 1,758,064,176. A
conservative, Jean Weir, physician to the Duke of Cleves, estimated the
number to be only 7,409,127. The ratio of women to men executed has been
variously estimated at 20 to 1 and 100 to 1. Witchcraft was a woman\'s
crime.

Men were, not surprisingly, most often the bewitched. Subject to
women's evil designs, they were terrified victims. Those men who were
convicted of witchcraft were often family of convicted women witches, or
were in positions of civil power, or had political ambitions which
conflicted with those of the Church, a monarch, or a local dignitary.
Men were protected from becoming witches not only by virtue of superior
intellect and faith, but because Jesus Christ, phallic divinity, died
"to preserve the male sex from so great a crime: since He was willing to
be born and to die for us, therefore He has granted to men this
privilege. " ^12^ Christ died literally for
and left women to fend with the Devil themselves. Without the personal
intercession of Christ, women remained what they had always been in
Judeo-Christian culture:

> > Now the wickedness of women is spoken of
> > in  xxv: There is no head above
> > the head of a serpent: and there is no wrath above the wrath
> > of a woman. I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon

>
The word "woman" means "the lust of the flesh. As it is said: I have
found a woman more bitter than death, and a good woman subject to carnal
lust. " ^14^

Other characteristics of women made them amenable to sin and to
partnership with Satan:

Women are by nature instruments of Satan ---they are by nature carnal,
a structural defect rooted in the original creation:

In addition, "Women also have weak memories, " "woman will follow her
own impulse even to her own destruction, " "nearly all the kingdoms of
the world have been overthrown by women, " "the world now suffers
through the malice of women, " "a woman is beautiful to look upon,
contaminating to the touch, and deadly to keep, " "she is a
liar by nature, " "her gait, posture, and habit \... is vanity of
vanities. "
^18^

Women are most vividly described as being "more bitter than
death":

Here the definition of woman, in common with the pornographic
definition, is her carnality; the essence of her character, in common
with the fairy-tale definition, is her malice and avarice. The words
flow almost too easily in our psychoanalytic age: we are dealing with an
existential terror of women, of the "mouth of the womb, " stemming from
a primal anxiety about male potency, tied to a desire for self (phallic)
control; men have deep-rooted castration fears which are expressed as a
horror of the womb. These terrors form the substrata of a myth of
feminine evil which in turn justified several centuries of
gynocide.

The evidence, provided by the and the
executions which blackened those centuries, is almost without limit. One
particular concern was that devils stole semen (vitality) from innocent,
sleeping men --- seductive witches visited men in their sleep, and did
the evil stealing. As Ernest Jones wrote:

To be dreamed of often ended in slow burning on the stake.

The most blatant proof of the explicitly sexual nature of the
persecutions, however, had to do with one of the witches\' most frequent
crimes: they cast "glamours" over the male organ so that it
disappeared entirely. Sprenger and Kramer go to great lengths to prove
that witches do not actually remove the genital, only render it
invisible. If such a glamour lasts for under 3 years, a marriage cannot
be annulled; if it lasts for 3 years or longer, it is considered a
permanent fact and does annul any marriage. Catholics now seeking
grounds for divorce should perhaps consider using that
one.

Men lost their genitals quite frequently. Most often, the woman
responsible for the loss was a cast-off mistress, maliciously turned to
witchcraft. If the bewitched man could identify the woman who had
afflicted him, he could demand reinstatement of his genitals:

> > A young man who had lost his member and suspected a certain woman,
> > tied a towel about her neck, choked her and demanded to be cured.
> > "The witch touched him with her hand between the thighs, saying,
> > 'Now you have your desire. ' " His member was immediately restored.
> > ^22^
>
Often the witches, greedy by virtue of womanhood, were not content with
the theft of one genital:

How can we understand that millions of people for centuries believed as
literal truth these seemingly idiotic allegations? How can we begin to
comprehend that these beliefs functioned as the basis of a system of
jurisprudence that condemned 9 million persons, mostly women, to being
burned alive? The literal text of the Malleus
Maleficarum, with its frenzied and psychotic woman-hating and
the fact of the 9 million deaths, demonstrates the power of the myth of
feminine evil, reveals how it dominated the dynamics of a culture, shows
the absolute primal terror that women, as carnal beings, hold for
men.

We see in the text of the not only the
fear of loss of potency or virility, but of the genitals themselves ---
a dread of the loss of cock and balls. The reason for this fear can
perhaps be located in the nature of the sex act per se: men enter the
vagina hard, erect; men emerge drained of vitality, the cock flaccid.
The loss of semen, and the feeling of weakness which is its biological
conjunct, has extraordinary significance to men. Hindu tradition, for
instance, postulates that men must either expel the semen and then
vacuum it back up into the cock, or not ejaculate at all. For those
Western men for whom orgasm is simultaneous with ejaculation, sex must
be a most literal death, with the mysterious, muscled, pulling vagina
the death-dealer.

To locate the origins of the myth of feminine evil in male castration
and potency fears is not so much to participate in the Freudian world
view as it is to accept and apply the anthropologist\'s method and link
up Western Judeo-Christian man with Australian, African, or Trobriand
primitives. To do so is to challenge the egotism which informs our
historical attitude toward ourselves and which would separate
us from the rest of the species. There is nothing to indicate that
"civilization, " "culture, " and/or Christianity have in any way
moderated the primal male dread of castration. Quite the
contrary, might even be defined as the
study of the concrete expression of that dread.

The Christians in their manifold variety were continuing the highly
developed Jewish tradition of misogyny, patriarchy, and sexist
suppression, alternatively known as the Garden-of-Eden-Hype. The Adam
and Eve creation myth is basic myth of man and
woman, creation, death, and sex. There is another Jewish legend, namely
that of Adam-Lilith, which never assumed that place because it implies
other, nonsexist, nonpatriarchal values. The Genesis account of Adam and
Eve in Eden involves, according to Hays, three themes: "the transition
from primitive life to civilization, the coming of death, and the
acquisition of knowledge. "^24^ As Hays points out, Adam has been told
by God the Father that if he eats from the Tree of Knowledge he will
die. The serpent tells Eve that she and Adam will not die. The serpent,
it turns out, told the immediate truth: Adam and Eve do not keel over
dead; rather, they know each other carnally.

Sex is, biblically speaking, the sole source of civilization, death,
and knowledge. As punishment, Adam must go to work and Eve must bear
children. We have here the beginning of the human family and the work
ethic, both tied to guilt and sexual repression by virtue of their
origins. One could posit, with all the assurance of a Monday-morning
quarterback, that Adam and Eve always were mortal and carnal and that
through eating the forbidden fruit only became aware of what
their condition had always been. God has never been very straightforward
with people.

Whether the precise moral of the story is that death is a direct
punishment for carnal knowledge (which might make guilt an
epistemological corollary) or that awareness of sex and death are
coterminous, the fact of man knowing and feeling guilt is rooted in the
Oedipal content of the legend. In a patriarchy, one does not disobey the
father.

Adam's legacy post-Eden is sexual knowledge, mortality, guilt, toil,
and the fear of castration. Adam became a human male, the head of a
family. His sin was lesser than Eve's, seemingly by definition again.
Even in Paradise, wantonness, infidelity, carnality, lust, greed,
intellectual inferiority, and a metaphysical stupidity earmark her
character. Yet her sin was greater than Adam's. God had, in his
oft-noted wisdom, created her in a way which left her defenseless
against the wiles of the snake ---the snake approached her for that very
reason. Yet she bears responsibility for the fall. Doubledouble think is
clearly biblical in its origins.

Eve's legacy was a twofold curse: "Unto the woman He said: 'I will
greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring
forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall
rule over thee. ' " ^25^ Thus, the menstrual cycle and the traditional
agony of childbirth do not comprise the full punishment ---patriarchy is
the other half of that ancient curse.

The Christians, of course, like Avis, trying harder, seeing in woman
the root of all evil, limited her to breeding more sinners for the
Church to save. No wonder then that women remained faithful adherents of
the older totemic cults of Western Europe which honored female
sexuality, deified the sexual organs and reproductive capacity, and
recognized woman as embodying the regenerative power of nature. The
rituals of these cults, centering as they did on sexual potency, birth,
and phenomena connected to fertility, had been developed by women. Magic
was the substance of ritual, the content of belief. The magic of the
witches was an imposing catalogue of medical skills concerning
reproductive and psychological processes, a sophisticated knowledge of
telepathy, auto- and hetero-suggestion, hypnotism, and mood-controlling
drugs. Women knew the medicinal nature of herbs and developed formulae
for using them. The women who were faithful to the pagan cults developed
the science of organic medicine, using vegetation, before there was any
notion of the of medicine. Paracelsus,
the most famous physician of the Middle Ages, claimed that everything he
knew he had learned from "the good women. " ^26^ 

Experimenting with herbs, women learned that those which would kill
when administered in large doses had curative powers when administered
in smaller amounts. Unfortunately, it is as poisoners that the witches
are remembered. The witches used drugs like belladonna and aconite,
organic amphetamines, and hallucinogenics. They also pioneered the
development of analgesics. They performed abortions, provided all
medical help for births, were consulted in cases of impotence which they
treated with herbs and hypnotism, and were the first practitioners of
euthanasia. Since the Church enforced the curse of Eve by refusing to
permit any alleviation of the pain of childbirth, it was left to the
witches to lessen pain and mortality as best they could. It was
especially as midwives that these learned women offended the Church,
for, as Sprenger and Kramer wrote, "No one does more harm to the
Catholic Faith than mid wives. " ^27^ The Catholic objection to abortion
centered specifically on the biblical curse which made childbearing a
painful punishment ---it did not have to do with the "right to life" of
the unborn fetus. It was also said that midwives were able to remove
labor pains from the woman and transfer those pains to her
husband---clearly in violation of divine injunction and intention
both.

The origins of the magical content of the pagan cults can be traced
back to the fairies, who were a real, neolithic people, smaller in
stature than the natives of northern Europe or England. They were a
pastoral people who had no knowledge of agriculture. They fled before
stronger, technologically more advanced murderers and missionaries who
had contempt for their culture. They set up communities in the inlands
and concealed their dwellings in mounds half hidden in the ground. The
fairies developed those magical skills for which the witches, centuries
later, were burned.

The socioreligious organization of the fairy culture was matriarchal
and probably polyandrous. The fairy culture was still extant in England
as late as the 17th century when even the pagan beliefs of the early
witches had degenerated into the Christian parody which we associate
with Satanism. The Christians rightly recognized the fairies as ancient,
original sorcerers, but wrongly saw their whole culture as an expression
of the demonic. There was communication between the fairies and the
pagan women, and any evidence that a woman had visited the fairies was
considered sure proof that she was a witch.

There were, then, three separate, though interrelated, phenomena: the
fairy race with its matriarchal social organization, its knowledge of
esoteric magic and medicine; the woman-oriented fertility cults, also
practitioners of esoteric magic and medicine; and later, the diluted
witchcraft cults, degenerate parodies of Christianity. There is
particular confusion when one tries to distinguish between the last two
phenomena. Many of the women condemned by the Inquisition were true
devotees of the Old Religion. Many were confused by Christian militancy
and aggression, not to mention torture and threat of burning, and saw
themselves as diabolical, damned witches.

An understanding of what the Old Religion really was, how it
functioned, is crucial if we want to understand the precise nature of
the witch hunt, the amount and kind of distortion that the myth of
feminine evil made possible, who the women were who were being burned,
and what they had really done. The information available comes primarily
from the confessions of accused witches, recorded and distorted by the
Inquisitors, and from the work of anthropologists like Margaret Murray
and C. L\'Estrange Ewen. The scenario of the witchcraft cults is pieced
together from those sources, but many pieces are missing. A lot of
knowledge disappears with 9 million people.

The religion was organized with geographic integrity. Communities had
their own organizations, mainly structured in covens, with local
citizens as administrators. There were weekly meetings which took care
of business ---they were called esbats. Then there were larger
gatherings, called sabbats, where many covens met together for totemic
festivities. There may have been an actual continental organization with
one all-powerful head, but evidence on this point is ambiguous. It was a
proselytizing religion in that nonmembers were approached by local
officials and asked to join. Conditions of membership in a coven were
the free consent of the individual, abjuration of all other beliefs and
loyalties (particularly renunciation of any loyalty to the new Catholic
Faith), and an avowal of allegiance to the horned god. Membership was
contractual, that is, a member signed an actual contract which limited
her obligations to the cult to a specific number of years, at the end of
which she was free to terminate allegiance. Most often the Devil
"promised her Mony, and that she would live gallantly and have the
pleasure of the World\... " ^28^ The neophyte's debts probably were paid
and she no doubt also learned the secrets of medicine, drugs, telepathy,
and simple sanitation, which would have considerably improved all
aspects of her earthly existence. It was only according to the Church
that she lost her soul as part of the bargain. And, needless to say, it
was the Church, not the Devil, which took her life.

Once the neophyte made the decision for the horned god, she went
through a formal initiation, often conducted at the sabbat. The ceremony
was simple. The initiate declared that she was joining the coven of her
own free will and swore devotion to the master of the coven
who represented the horned god. She was then marked with some kind of
tattoo which was called the witches' mark. The inflicting of the tattoo
was painful, and the healing process was long. When healed, the scar was
red or blue and indelible. One method particularly favored by the witch
hunters when hunting was to take a suspected woman, shave her pubic and
other bodily hair (including head hair, eyebrows, etc. ) and, upon
finding any scar, find her guilty of witchcraft. Also, the existence of
any supernumerary nipple, common in all mammals, was proof of
guilt.

The initiate was often given a new name, especially if she had a
Christian name like Mary or Faith. Children, when they reached puberty,
were initiated into the coven --- parents naturally wanted their
children to share the family religion. The Inquisition was as ruthless
with children as it was with adults. There are stories of children being
whipped as their mothers were being burned ---prevention, it was
called.

The religious ceremony, which was the main content of the sabbat,
included dancing, eating, and fucking. The worshipers paid homage to the
horned god by kissing his representative, the master of the coven,
anywhere he indicated. The kiss was generally on the master's ass
---designed, some say, to provoke the antisodomy Christians. That ritual
kiss was possibly placed on a mask which the costumed figure ---masked,
horned, wearing animal skins, and probably an artificial phallus ---wore
under his tail. The disguise conjures up the ancient, two-faced
Janus.

The witches danced ring dances in a direction opposite to the path of
the sun, an ancient, symbolic rite. The Lutherans and Puritans forbade
dancing because it evoked for them the spectacle of pagan
worship.

After the dancing, the witches ate. Often they brought their own food,
rather in the tradition of picnic lunches, and sometimes the coven
leader provided a real feast. The Christians alleged that the witches
were cannibals and that their dinner was an orgy of human flesh, cooked
and garnished as only the Devil knew how. Actually, the supper common to
all sabbats was a simple meal of pedestrian food.

The whole notion of cannibalism and sacrifice has been stubbornly,
persistently, and purposely misunderstood. There is no evidence that any
living child was killed to be eaten, or that any living child was
sacrificed. There is evidence that sometimes dead infants were ritually
eaten, or used in ritual. Cannibalism, and its not so symbolic
substitute, animal sacrifice, was a vital part of the ritual of all
early religions, including the Jewish one. The witches participated in
this tradition rather modestly: they generally sacrificed a goat or a
hen. It was the Christians who developed and extended the Old World
system of sacrifice and cannibalism to almost surreal ends: Christ, the
sacrificial lamb, who died an agonizing death on the cross to ensure
forgiveness of men's sins and whose followers symbolically, even today,
eat of his flesh and drink of his blood --- what is the Eucharist if not
fossilized cannibalism?

The final activity of the sabbat was a phallic orgy --- heathen,
drug-abetted, communal sex. The sex of the sabbat is distinguished by
descriptions of pain. It was said that intercourse was painful, that the
phallus of the masked coven leader was cold and oversized, that no woman
ever conceived. It would seem that the horned figure used an artificial
phallus and could service all the celebrants. The Old Religion, as
opposed to the Christian religion, celebrated sexuality, fertility,
nature and woman\'s place in it, and communal sex was a logical and most
sacral rite.

The worship of animals is also indigenous to nature-based religious
systems. Early people existed among animals, scarcely distinct from
them. Through religious ritual, people differentiated themselves from
animals and gave honor to them ---they were food, sustenance. There was
a respect for the natural world --- people were hunter and hunted
simultaneously. Their perspective was acute. They worshiped the spirit
and power they saw manifest in the carnivore world of which they were an
integral part. When man began to be "civilized, " to separate himself
out of nature, to place himself over and above woman (he became Mind,
she became Carnality) and other animals, he began to seek power over
nature, magical control. The witch cults still had a strong sense of
people as part of nature, and animals maintained a prime place in both
ritual and consciousness for the witches. The Christians, who had a
profound and compulsive hatred for the natural world, thought that the
witches, through malice and a lust for power (pure projection, no
doubt), had mobilized nature/animals into a robotlike anti-Christian
army. The witch hunters were convinced that toads, rats, dogs, cats,
mice, etc., took orders from witches, carried curses from one farm to
another, caused death, hysteria, and disease. They thought that nature
was one massive, crawling conspiracy against them, and that the
conspiracy was organized and controlled by the wicked women. They can in
fact be credited with pioneering the politics of total paranoia ---they
developed the classic model for that particular pathology which has, as
its logical consequence, genocide. Their methods of dealing with the
witch menace were developed empirically--- they had a great respect for
what worked. For instance, when they suspected a woman of witchcraft,
they would lock her in an empty room for several days or weeks and if
any living creature, any insect or spider, entered that room, that
creature was identified as the woman\'s familiar, and she was proved
guilty of witchcraft. Naturally, given the fact that bugs are
everywhere, particularly in the woodwork, this test of guilt always
worked.

Cats were particularly associated with witches. That association is
based on the ancient totemic significance of the cat:

> It is well known that to the Egyptians cats were sacred. They were
> regarded as incarnations of Isis and there was also a cat deity\....
> Through Osiris (Ra) they were associated with the sun; the rays of the
> "solar cat, " who was portrayed as killing the "serpent of darkness"
> at each dawn, were believed to produce fecundity in Nature, and thus
> cats were figures of fertility\.... Cats were also associated with
> Hathor, a cow-headed goddess, and hence with crops and
> rain\....

> Still stronger, however, was the association of the cat with the
> moon, and thus she was a virgin goddess --- a virgin-mother
> incarnation. In her character as moon-goddess she was inviolate and
> self-renewing\... the circle she forms in a curled-up position \is
> seen as\ the symbol for eternity, an unending re-creation.
> ^29^

The Christians not only converted the horned god into Satan, but also
the sacred cat into a demonic incarnation. The witches, in accepting
familiars and particularly in their special feeling for cats, only
participated in an ancient tradition which had as its substance love and
respect for the natural
world.\

It was also believed that the witch could transform herself into a cat
or other animal. This notion, called lycanthropy, is twofold:

> \... either the belief that a witch or devil-ridden person
> temporarily assumes an animal form, to ravage or destroy; or, that
> they create an animal "double" in which, leaving the lifeless human
> body at home, he or she can wander, terrorize, or batten on mankind.
> ^30^

The origins of the belief in lycanthropy can be traced to group rituals
in which celebrants, costumed as animals, recreated animal movements,
sounds, even hunting patterns. As group ritual, those celebrations would
be prehistorical. The witches themselves, through the use of belladonna,
aconite, and other drugs, felt that they did become animals.^\*^ The
effect of the belief in lycanthropy on the general population was
electric: a stray dog, a wild cat, a rat, a toad ---all were witches,
agents of Satan, bringing with them drought, disease, death. Any animal
in the environment was dangerous, demonic. The legend of the werewolf
(popularized in the Red Riding Hood fable) caused terror. At Labout, two
hundred people were burned as werewolves. There were endless stories of
farmers shooting animals who were plaguing them in the night, only to
discover the next morning that a respectable town matron had been
wounded in precisely the same way.

Witches, of course, could also fly on broomsticks, and often did.
Before going to the sabbat, they annointed their bodies with a mixture
of belladonna and aconite, which caused delirium, hallucination, and
gave the sensation of flying. The broomstick was an almost archetypal
symbol of womanhood, as the pitchfork was of manhood. Levitation was
considered a rare but genuine fact:

With typical consistency then, the Church said that saints could fly
but witches could not. As far as the witches were concerned,
they trusted their experience, they knew that they flew. Here they
aligned themselves with Christian saints, yogis, mystics from all
traditions, in the realization of a phenomenon so ancient that it would
seem to extend almost to the origins of the religious impulse in
people.

We now know most of what can be known about the witches: who they were,
what they believed, what they did, the Church\'s vision of them. We have
seen the historical dimensions of a myth of feminine evil which resulted
in the slaughter of 9 million persons, nearly all women, over 300 years.
The actual evidence of that slaughter, the remembrance of it, has been
suppressed for centuries so that the myth of woman as the Original
Criminal, the gaping, insatiable womb, could endure. Annihilated with
the 9 million was a whole culture, woman-centered, nature-centered
---all of their knowledge is gone, all of their knowing is destroyed.
Historians (white, male, and utterly without credibility for women,
Indians, Blacks, and other oppressed peoples as they begin to search the
ashes of their own pasts) found the massacre of the witches too
unimportant to include in the chronicles of those centuries except as a
footnote, too unimportant to be seen as the substance of those centuries
---they did not recognize the centuries of gynocide, they did not
register the anguish of those deaths.

Our study of pornography, our living of life, tells us that the myth of
feminine evil lived out so resolutely by the Christians of the Dark
Ages, is alive and well, here and now. Our study of pornography, our
living of life, tells us that though the witches are dead,
burned alive at the stake, the belief in female evil is not,
the hatred of female carnality is not. The Church has not changed its
premises; the culture has not refuted those premises. It is left to us,
the inheritors of that myth, to destroy it and the institutions based on
it.

We want to destroy sexism, that is, polar role definitions of male and
female, man and woman. We want to destroy patriarchal power at its
source, the family; in its most hideous form, the nation-state. We want
to destroy the structure of culture as we know it, its art, its
churches, its laws: all of the images, institutions, and structural
mental sets which define women as hot wet fuck tubes, hot
slits.

Androgynous mythology provides us with a model which does not use polar
role definitions, where the definitions are not, implicitly or
explicitly, male = good, female = bad, man = human, woman = other.
Androgyny myths are multisexual mythological models. They go well beyond
bisexuality as we know it in the scenarios they suggest for building
community, for realizing the fullest expression of human sexual
possibility and creativity.

Androgyny as a concept has no notion of sexual repression built into
it. Where woman is carnality, and carnality is evil, it stands to reason
(hail reason! ) that woman must be chained, whipped, punished, purged;
that fucking is shameful, forbidden, fearful, guiltridden.
Androgyny as the basis of sexual identity and community life provides no
such imperatives. Sexual freedom and freedom for biological women, or
all persons "female, " are not separable. That they are different, and
that sexual freedom has priority, is the worst of sexist hypes.
Androgyny can show the way to both. It may be the one road to freedom
open to women, men, and that emerging majority, the rest of
us.

\




CHAPTER 8

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Androgyny: The Mythological Model**

It is a question of finding the right model. We are born into a world
in which sexual possibilities are narrowly circumscribed: Cinderella,
Snow-white, Sleeping Beauty; O, Claire, Anne; romantic love and
marriage; Adam and Eve, the Virgin Mary. These models are the
substantive message of this culture ---they define psychological sets
and patterns of social interaction which, in our adult personae, we live
out. We function inside the socioreligious scenario of right and wrong,
good and bad, licit and illicit, legal and illegal, all saturated with
shame and guilt. We are by the culture
as surely as rats are programmed to make the arduous way through the
scientist's maze, and that programming operates on every level of choice
and action. For example, we have seen how the romantic ethos is related
to the way women dress and cosmeticize their bodies and how that
behavior regulates the literal physical mobility of women. Take any
aspect of behavior and one can find the source of the programmed
response in the cultural structure. Western man's obsessive concern with
metaphysical and political freedom is almost laughable in this
context.

Depth psychologists consider man the center of his world ---his psyche
is the primary universe which governs, very directly, the secondary
universe, distinct from him, of nature; philosophers consider man, in
the fragmented, highly overrated part called intellect, the center of
the natural world, indeed its only significant member; artists consider
man, isolated in his creative function, the center of the creative
process, of the canvas, of the poem, an engineer of the culture;
politicians consider man, represented by his sociopolitical organization
and its armies, the center of whatever planetary power might be relevant
and meaningful; religionists consider God a surrogate man, created
precisely in man's image, only more so, to be father to the human
family. The notion of man as a part of the natural world, integrated
into it, in form as distinct (no more so) as the tarantula, in function
as important (no more so) as the honey bee or tree, is in eclipse, and
that eclipse extends not over a decade, or over a century, but over the
whole of written history. The arrogance which informs man's relation
with nature (simply, he is superior to it) is precisely the same
arrogance which informs his relationship with woman (simply, he is
superior to her). Here we see the full equation: woman = carnality =
nature. The separation of man from nature, man placing himself over and
above it, is directly responsible for the current ecological situation
which may lead to the extinction of many forms of life, including human
life. Man has treated nature much as he has treated woman: with rape,
plunder, violence. The phenomenological world is characterized by its
diversity, the complexity and mutuality of its interactions,
and man's only chance for survival in that world consists of finding the
proper relationship to
it.

In terms of interhuman relationship, the problem is similar. As
individuals, we experience ourselves as the center of whatever social
world we inhabit. We think that we are free and refuse to see
that
That culture no longer organically reflects us, it is not our sum
total, it is not the collective phenomenology of our creative
possibilities ---it possesses and rules us, reduces us, obstructs the
flow of sexual and creative energy and activity, penetrates even into
what Freud called the id, gives nightmare shape to natural desire. In
order to achieve proper balance in interhuman interaction, we must find
ways to change ourselves from culturally defined agents into naturally
defined beings. We must find ways of destroying the cultural personae
imposed on our psyches and we must discover forms of relationship,
behavior, sexual being and interaction, which are compatible with our
inherent natural possibilities. We must move away from the perverse,
two-dimensional definitions which stem from sexual repression, which are
the source of social oppression, and move toward creative, full,
multidimensional modes of sexual expression.

Essentially the argument is this: we look at the world we inhabit and
we see disaster everywhere; police states; prisons and mental hospitals
filled to overflowing; alienation of workers from their work, women and
men from each other, children from the adult community, governments
contemptuous of their people, people filled with intense self-hatred;
street violence, assault, rape, contract murderers, psychotic killers;
acquisition gone mad, concentrated power and wealth; hunger, want,
starvation, camps filled with refugees. Those phenomena mark the
distance between civilized man and natural man, tribal man, whose sexual
and social patterns functioned in a more integrated, balanced way. We
know how it is now, and we want to know how it was then. While we cannot
reconstruct the moment when humans emerged in evolution into
recognizable humanness, or analyze that person to see what existence was
like, while we cannot seek to emulate rituals and social forms of tribal
people, or penetrate to and then imitate the dynamic relationship
primitive people had with the rest of the natural world, while we cannot
even know much of what happened before people made pottery and built
cities, while we cannot (and perhaps would not) obliterate the knowledge
that we do have (of space travel and polio vaccines, cement and
Hiroshima), we can still find extant in the culture echoes of a distant
time when people were more together, figuratively and literally. These
echoes reflect a period in human development when people functioned as a
part of the natural world, not set over against it; when men and women,
male and female, were whatever they were, not polar opposites, separated
by dress and role into castes, fragmented pieces of some
not-to-be-imagined whole.

In recent years, depth psychologists in particular have turned to
primitive people and tribal situations in an effort to penetrate into
the basic dynamics of male and female. The most notable effort was made
by Jung, and it is necessary to state here that, admirable as his other
work sometimes is, Jung and his followers have carried the baggage of
patriarchy and sexual dualism with them into the search. Jung describes
male and female in the absolute terms native to the culture, as
archetypes preexistent in the psyche. Male is defined as authority,
logic, order, that which is saturnian and embodies the consonant values
of patriarchy; female is defined as emotional, receptive, anarchic,
cancerian. Matriarchy preceded patriarchy because patriarchal values
(particularly the need for complex organization) inform advanced
societies, whereas female values inform more primitive tribal societies.
As far as individual men and women are concerned, the male psyche has a
feminine component (the subconscious) which is anarchic, emotional,
sensitive,, and the female personality has a
male component (the conscious, or mind) which can be defined as a
capacity for logical thought. Of course, biological women are ruled, it
turns out, by the subconscious; men are ruled, not surprisingly, by the
conscious, mind, intellect. One might imagine a time and place where
intellect is not valued over anarchic, emotional, sensitive
---looniness?: but that would be the most gratuitous kind of fantasy.
Jung never questioned the cultural arbitrariness of these categories,
never looked at them to see their political implications, never knew
that they were sexist, that he functioned as an instrument of cultural
oppression.

In the book *Woman\'s Mysteries: Ancient and
Modern*, M. Esther Harding, a lifelong student of Jung and a
Patron of the C. G. Jung Institute, applies Jungian ontology to a study
of mythology. Taking the moon, Luna, as the patron saint of women
(ignoring any masculine imagery associated with the moon, and this
imagery is substantial; ignoring any feminine imagery connected with the
sun, and this imagery is substantial), Harding ultimately identifies the
female with the demonic, as did the Catholic Church:

> > But if she will stop long enough to look within, she also may
> > become aware of impulses and thoughts which are not in accord with
> > her conscious attitudes but are the direct outcome of the crude and
> > untamed feminine being within her. For the most part, however, a
> > woman will not look at these dark secrets of her own nature. It is
> > too painful, too undermining of the conscious character which she
> > has built up for herself; she prefers to think that she really is as
> > she appears to be. And indeed it is her task to stand between the
> > Eros which is within her, and the world without, and through her own
> > womanly adaptation to the world to make human, as it were, the
> > daemoniac power of the nonhuman feminine principle. ^1^
>
Eros, the subconscious, the flow of human sexual energy--- described as
the witch burners described it, "the daemoniac power of the nonhuman
feminine principle. " Harding is absolutely representative of the
Jungian point of view.

It is a natural consequence of this dualistic stance that male and
female are pitted against each other and that
conflict is the dynamic mode of relationship open to male
and female, men and women, when they meet:

> > These discrepancies in their attitudes are dependent on the fact
> > that the psychic constitution of men and women are essentially
> > different; they are mirror opposites the one of the other\.... So
> > that their essential nature and values are diametrically opposed.
> > ^2^
>
These male and female sets are defined as archetypes, embedded in a
collective unconscious, the given structure of reality. They are polar
opposites; their mode of interaction is conflict. They cannot possibly
understand each other because they are absolutely different: and of
course, it is always easier to do violence to something Other, something
whose "nature and values" are other. (Women have never understood that
they are, by definition, Other, not male, therefore not human. But men
do experience women as being totally opposite, other. How easy violence
is. ) There is, because Jung was a good man and Jungians are good
people, a happy ending: though these two forces, male and female, are
opposite, they are complementary, two halves of the same whole. One is
not superior, one is not inferior. One is not good, one is not bad. But
this resolution is inadequate because the culture, in its fiction and
its history, demonstrates that one (male, logic, order, ego, father) is
good and superior both, and that the other (guess which) is bad and
inferior both. *It is the so-called female principle of Eros
that all the paraphernalia of patriarchy conspires to suppress through
the psychological, physiological* *and economic
oppression of those who are biologically women.* Jung's
ontology serves those persons and institutions which subscribe to the
myth of feminine evil.

The identification of the feminine with Eros, or erotic energy
(carnality by any other name), comes from a fundamental misunderstanding
of the nature of human sexuality. The essential information which would
lead to nonsexist, nonrepressive notions of sexuality is to be found in
androgyny myths, myths which describe the creation of the
first human being as male and female in one form. In other words, Jung
chose the wrong model, the wrong myths, on which to construct a
psychology of male and female. He used myths infused with patriarchal
values, myths which gained currency in male-dominated cultures. The
anthropological discoveries which fueled the formation of his theories
all reveal relatively recent pieces of human history. With few
exceptions, all of the anthropological information we have deals with
the near past. But the myths which are the foundation of and legitimize
our culture are gross perversions of original creation myths which
molded the psyches of earlier, possibly less self-conscious and more
conscious, peoples. The original myths all concern a primal androgyne
---an androgynous godhead, an androgynous people. The corruptions of
these myths of a primal androgyne without exception uphold patriarchal
notions of sexual polarity, duality, male and female as opposite and
antagonistic. The myth of a primal androgyne survives as part of a real
cultural underground: though it is ignored, despised by a culture which
posits other values, and though those who relate their lifestyles
directly to it have been ostracized and
persecuted.

With all of this talk of myth and mythology, what is myth, and why does
it have such importance? The best definition remains that of Eliade, who
wrote in
Dreams

I would extend Eliade's definition in only one
respect. It is not only in primitive and
archaic societies
that myths
provide this model for behavior ---it is in
every human
society. The distance between myth and
social organization
is perhaps greater, or more tangled,
in advanced
technological societies, but myth still operates as the substructure of
the collective. The story of Adam and Eve will affect the shape of
settlements on the moon and Mars, and the Christian version of the
primitive myth of a divine fertility sacrifice saturates the most
technologically advanced communications
media.

What are the myths of androgyny, and how do we locate them behind the
myths of polarity with which we are familiar? Let us begin with the
Chinese notions of yin and yang.

Yin and yang are commonly associated with female and male. The Chinese
ontology, so appealing in that it appears to give whole, harmonious,
value-free description of phenomena, describes cosmic movement as
cyclical, thoroughly interwoven manifestation of yang (masculine,
aggressive, light, spring, summer) and yin (female, passive, dark, fall,
winter). The sexual identifications reduce the concepts too often to
conceptual polarities: they are used to fix the proper natures of men
and women as well as the forces of male and female. These definitions,
like the Jungian ones which are based on them, are seemingly modified by
the assertions that (1) all people are composed of both yin and yang,
though in the man yang properly predominates and in the woman yin
properly predominates; (2) these male and female forces are two parts of
a whole, equally vital, mutually indispensable. Unfortunately, as one
looks to day-to-day life, that biological incarnation of yin, woman,
finds herself, as always, the dark half of the universe.

The sexual connotations of yin and yang, however, are affixed onto the
original concepts. They reflect an already patriarchal, and misogynist,
culture. Richard

Wilhelm, in an essay on an ancient Chinese text called The
Secret of the Golden Flower, gives the uncorrupted meanings
of yin and yang:

> > Out of the Tao, and the \"the great
> > ridge pole, the supreme ultimate"\ there develop the principles of
> > reality, the one pole being the light (yang) and the other the dark,
> > or the shadowy, (yin). Among European scholars, some have turned
> > first to sexual references for an explanation, but the characters
> > refer to phenomena in nature. Yin is shade, therefore the north side
> > of a mountain and the south side of a river.
>
> > \... Yang, in its original form, indicates flying pennants and,
> > corresponding to the character of yin, is the south side of a
> > mountain and the north side of a river. Starting only with the
> > meaning of "light" and "dark, " the principle was then expanded to
> > all polar opposites, including the sexual. However, since both yin

> > only in the realm of phenomena, where yang appears as the active
> > principle and conditions, and yin as the passive principle is
> > derived and conditioned, it is quite clear that a metaphysical
> > dualism is not the basis for these ideas. ^4^
>
Light and dark are obvious in a phenomenological sense ---there is day
and it slowly changes into night which then slowly changes into day.
When men began conceptualizing about the nature of the universe, the
phenomena of light and dark were an obvious starting point. My own
experience is that night and day are more alike than different ---in
which case they couldn\'t possibly be opposite. Man, in conceptualizing,
has reduced phenomena to two, when phenomena are more complex and subtle
than intellect can imagine.

Still, how is it that it is the feminine, the sexually female, that is
embodied in yin? Even patriarchy and misogyny began somewhere. Here I
can only guess. We know that at one time men were hunters and women were
planters. Both forms of work were essential and arduous. Both demanded
incredible physical strength and considerable knowledge and skill. Why
did men hunt and women plant? Clearly women planted because they were
often pregnant, and though pregnancy did not make them weak and passive,
it did mean that they could not run, go without food for long periods of
time, survive on the terms that hunting demanded. It is probable that
very early in human history women also were hunters, and that it was
crucial to the survival of the species that they develop into planters
--- first to supplement the food supply, second to reduce infant and
woman mortality. We see that the first division of labor based on
biological sex originated in a fundamental survival imperative. In the
earliest of times, with no contraception and no notion of the place of
the man in the process of impregnation, women were invested with a
supreme magical power, one which engendered awe and fear in men. As they
developed skill in planting, they embodied even more explicitly
fertility, generation, and of course death. The overwhelming mana of
women, coupled with the high mortality which went along with childbirth,
could well have led to practices of protection, segregation, and slowly
increasing social restriction. With pregnancy as the one inevitable in a
woman's life, men began to organize social life in a way which excluded
woman, which limited her to the living out of her reproductive function.
 As men began to know power, that power directly related to
the exclusion of women from community life, the myth of feminine evil
developed and provided justification for laws, rites, and other
practices which relegated women to pieces of property. As a corollary,
men developed the taste for subjugating others and hoarding power and
wealth which characterizes them to this very
day.

Returning to yin and yang, what is crucial is the realization that
these concepts did not originally attach to sex. In more concrete terms,
the Great Original (first being) of the Chinese chronicles is the holy
woman T'ai Yuan, who was an androgyne, a combined manifestation of yin
and yang. Primacy is given to the feminine principle here (the gender of
the noun is feminine) because of woman's generative function.

Among the Tibetan Buddhists, the so-called male-female polarities are
called among the Indian Hindus, they are
called Shiva and Shakti. In the Tantric sects of both traditions, one
finds a living religious cult attached to the myth of a primal
androgyne, to the union of male and female. One also finds, not
surprisingly, that Tantric cults are condemned by the parent culture
with which they identify. The culminating religious rite of the Tantrics
is sacramental fucking, the ritual union of man and woman which
achieves, even if only symbolically, the original androgynous
energy.

This is the outstanding fact when one looks at
yabyum

> > The Hindu assigned the male symbol apparatus to the passive, the
> > female to the active pole; the Buddhist did the opposite; the Hindu
> > assigned the knowledge principle to the passive male pole, and the
> > dynamic principle to the active female pole; the Vajrayana Buddhist
> > did it the other way around. ^5^
>
The explanation for this major difference, this attachment in one case
of the feminine to the passive and in the other of the feminine to the
active, is that these attachments were made
arbitrarily. ^6^ Two convictions vital to sexist ontology
are undermined: that everywhere the feminine is synonymous with the
passive, receptive, etc., and so it must be true; that the definition of
the feminine as passive, receptive, etc., comes from the visible,
incontrovertible fact of feminine passivity, receptivity, etc.

In Hindu mythology, as opposed to Judaic mythology, the
phenomenological world is not created by god as something distinct from
him. It is the godhead in manifestation. As Campbell describes it: "\...
the image of the androgynous ancestor is developed in terms of an
essentially psychological reading of the problem of creation. " ^7^ In a
description of that androgynous being, we find: "He was just as large as
a man and woman embracing. This Self then divided himself into two
parts; and with that there was a master and a mistress. Therefore this
body, by itself, as the sage Yajnavalkya declares, is like half of a
split pea. " ^8^

In Egypt one of the earliest forms of moon deity was Isis-Net, an
androgyne. The Greek Artemis was androgynous. So is Awonawilona, chief
god of the Pueblo Zuni. The Greek god Eros was also
androgynous.

Plato, repeating a corrupted version of a much older myth, describes
in 3 types of original human beings:
male/male, male/female, female/female. These original humans were so
powerful that the gods feared them and so Zeus, whose own androgynous
ancestry did not stop him from becoming the Macho Kid, halved
them.

The Aranda of Australia know a supernatural being called Numbakulla,
"Eternal, " who made androgynes as the first beings, then split them
apart, then tied them back together with hemp to make couples. It is
essentially this story that is repeated throughout the primitive
world.

Certain African and Melanesian tribes have ancestral images of one
being with breasts, penis, and beard. Hindu statues which show Shiva and
Shakti united participate in the same devotional tradition ---we
perceive that they are united in sexual intercourse, but it is also
possible that they represent one literal androgynous body.

There are still devotional religious practices which harken back to the
mythology of the primal androgyne --- Tantra, for instance,
in both its Tibetan and Indian manifestations, clearly participates in
that tradition. Possibly the rite of subincision, practiced in
Australia, is similarly rooted in androgyne myth. Subincision is the
ritual slitting open of the underside of the penis to form a permanent
cleft into the urethra. The opening is called the "penis womb. "
Campbell notes that "The subincision produces artificially a hypospadias
resembling that of a certain class of hermaphrodites. "^9^ The drive
back to androgyny, where it is manifest, is sacral, strong, compelling.
It is interesting here to speculate on the incest taboo. The Freudian
articulation of what the Oedipal complex is and means serves the
imperatives of a patriarchal culture, of Judeo-Chris-tian morality, and
remains largely unchallenged. But the earliest
devotional mother-son configurations are those of a
Mother/Goddess and her Son/Lover. The son is lover to the mother and is
ritually sacrificed at a predetermined time (mothers don't have to be
possessive). This sacrifice is not related to guilt or punishment---it
is holy sacrifice which sanctifies the tribe, does honor to the
offering, and is premised on cyclic fertility patterns of life, death,
and regeneration. These rites, associated with the worship of the Great
Mother (the first corruption of the Great Original, or primal androgyne)
involved ritual intercourse between mother and son, with the subsequent
sacrifice of the son. At one time both a son and a daughter were
sacrificed, but as the daughter became a mother-surrogate, the son was
sacrificed alone. This sacralized set, Mother/Goddess-Son/Lover, and the
rituals associated with it, are postandrogyne developments: that is, men
and women experienced separateness (not duality) and attempted to
recreate symbolically the androgynous state of mind and body through
what we now call incest. If it is true that the implications of the
androgyny myths in terms of behavior run counter to every
Judeo-Christian, or more generally sexist, notion of morality, it would
follow that incest is the primary taboo of this and similar cultures
because it has its roots in the sexually dynamic androgynous mentality.
Indeed, it is not surprising to discover that early versions of the
Oedipus story do not end with Oedipus putting his eyes out. Sophocles
leaves Oedipus overcome with fear, guilt, and remorse, blinded and
ruined. In the earlier Homeric version, Oedipus becomes king and reigns
happily ever after. Freud chose the wrong version of the right
story.

Even Jewish mythology provides a primal androgyne. Here is the
substance of a cultural underground most directly related to us.
According to the Zohar, the first created woman was not Eve but Lilith.
She was created coterminous with Adam, that is, they were created in one
body, androgynous. They were of one substance, one corporality. God, so
the legend goes, split them apart so that Lilith could be dressed as a
bride and married to Adam properly, but Lilith rebelled at the whole
concept of marriage,, that is, of being defined as Adam's inferior, and
fled. Lilith was in fact the first woman and the first feminist both.
The Jewish patriarchs, with shrewd vengeance, called her a witch. They
said that the witch Lilith haunted the night (her name is etymologically
associated with the Hebrew word for night) and killed infants. She
became symbolic of the dark, evil side of all women. Of course, Lilith,
we know now, made the correct analysis and went to the core of the
problem: she rejected the nuclear family. God, however, saw it
differently --- he had created Lilith from dust, just as he had created
Adam. He had created her free and equal. Not making the same mistake
twice, Eve was created from Adam\'s rib, clearly giving her no claim to
either freedom or equality. It took the Christians to assert that since
the rib is bent, woman's nature is contrary to man's.

How then can we understand the biblical statement that God created man
in his own image ---male and female created he them? The Midrash gives
the definitive answer: When the Holy One, Blessed Be He,
created the first man, he created him androgynous.
^10^ There is also a corresponding Jewish androgynous
godhead. The very word for the godhead, is
composed of a feminine noun and a masculine plural ending. God is
multiple and androgynous. The tradition of the androgynous godhead is
most clearly articulated in the Kabbalah, a text which in written form
goes back to the Middle Ages. The oral Kabbalah, which is more extensive
than the written Kabbalah, originates in the most obscure reaches of
Jewish history, before the Bible, and has been preserved with, according
to occultists, more care than the written Bible ---that is, the Bible
has been rewritten, edited, modified, translated; oral Kabbalah has
retained its purity.

The Kabbalistic scheme of the godhead is complex. Suffice it here to
say that god is male and female interwoven. Certain parts are associated
with the female, other parts with the male. For instance, primal
understanding is female; wisdom is male; severity is female; mercy is
male. Special prominence is given to the final emanation of the godhead,
Malkuth the Queen, the physical manifestation of the godhead in the
universe. Malkuth the Queen is roughly equivalent to Shakti. For the
Kabbalists, as for the Tantrics, the ultimate sacrament is sexual
intercourse which recreates androgyny. Just as the Tantrics are/were
ostracized by the rest of the Hindu and Buddhist communities, so do the
main body of Jews ostracize the Kabbalists. Now they are considered to
be freaks ---they have been viewed as heretics. And heretics they are,
for in recognizing the androgynous nature of the godhead they undermine
the authority of God the Father and threaten the power of
patriarchy.

It remains only to point out that Christ also had some notion of
androgyny. In Gospel to the Egyptians, Christ and a disciple named
Salome have this conversation:

> > When Salome asked how long Death should prevail, the Lord said: So
> > long as ye women bear children; for I have come to destroy the work
> > of the Female. And Salome said to Him: Did I therefore well in
> > having no children? The Lord answered and said: Eat every Herb, but
> > eat not that which hath bitterness. When Salome asked when these
> > things about which she questioned would be made known, the Lord
> > said: When ye trample upon the garment of shame; when the Two become
> > One, and Male with Female neither male nor female. ^11^
>
In the next chapter I am going to pursue the implications of androgyny
myths in the areas of sexual identity and sexual behavior, and it would
be in keeping with the spirit of this book to take Christ as my guide
and say with him: "When ye trample upon the garment of shame; when the
Two become One, and Male with Female neither male nor female."



CHAPTER 9

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Androgyny: Androgyny, Fucking, and Community**

> Nothing short of everything will really do.
>
Aldous Huxley,

The discovery is, of course, that "man" and "woman" are fictions,
caricatures, cultural constructs. As models they are reductive,
totalitarian, inappropriate to human becoming. As roles they are static,
demeaning to the female, dead-ended for male and female both. Culture as
we know it legislates those fictive roles as normalcy. Deviations from
sanctioned, sacred behavior are "gender disorders, " "criminality, " as
well as "sick, " "disgusting, " and "immoral. " Heterosexuality, which
is properly defined as the ritualized behavior built on polar role
definition, and the social institutions related to it (marriage, the
family, the Church, are "human
nature. " Homosexuality, transsexuality, incest, and bestiality persist
as the "perversions" of this "human nature" we presume to know so much
about. They persist despite the overwhelming forces marshaled against
them ---discriminatory laws and social practices, ostracism, active
persecution by the state and other organs of the culture ---as
inexplicable embarrassments, as odious examples of "filth" and/or
"maladjustment. " The attempt here, however modest and
incomplete, is to discern another ontology, one which discards the
fiction that there are two polar distinct
sexes.

We have seen that androgyny myths present an image of one corporality
which is both male and female. Sometimes the image is literally a
man-form and a woman-form in one body. Sometimes it is a figure which
incorporates both male and female functions. In every case, that
mythological image is a paradigm for a wholeness, a harmony, and a
freedom which is virtually unimaginable, the antithesis of every
assumption we hold about the nature of identity in general and sex in
particular. The first question then is: What of biology? There are,
after all, men and women. They are different, demonstrably so. We are
each of one sex or the other. If there are two discrete biological
sexes, then it is not hard to argue that there are two discrete modes of
human behavior, sex-related, sex-determined. One might argue for a
liberalization of sex-based roles, but one cannot justifiably argue for
their total redefinition.

Hormone and chromosome research, attempts to develop new means of human
reproduction (life created in, or considerably supported by, the
scientist's laboratory), work with transsexuals, and studies of
formation of gender identity in children provide basic information which
challenges the notion that there are two discrete biological sexes. That
information threatens to transform the traditional biology of sex
difference into the radical biology of sex similarity. That is not to
say that there is one sex, but that there are many.
The evidence which is germane here is simple. The words
"male" and "female, " "man" and "woman, " are used only because as yet
there are no
others.

1.     Men and women have the same basic body structure. Both have both
male and female genitals ---the clitoris is a vestigial penis, the
prostate gland is most probably a vestigial womb. Since, as I pointed
out earlier, there is information on only 2 percent of human history,
and since religious chronicles, which were for centuries the only record
of human history, consistently speak of another time in the cycle of
time when humans were androgynous, and since each sex has the vestigial
organs of the other, there is no reason not to postulate that humans
once were androgynous --- hermaphroditic and androgynous, created
precisely in the image of that constantly recurring androgynous
godhead.

2.     Until the 7th week of fetal development both sexes have
precisely the same external genitalia. Basically, the development of sex
organs and ducts is the same for males and females and the same two sets
of ducts develop in both.

3.     The gonads cannot be said to be entirely male or female. Dr.
Mary Jane Sherfey writes:

> > In their somatic organization, the gonads always retain a greater
> > or lesser amount of the opposite-sex tissue which remains functional
> > throughout life. ^1^
>
4.     Chromosomal sex is not necessarily the visible sex of the
individual. It happens that a person of one chromosomal sex
develops the gonads of the other sex.
^\* ^*Gonadal
sex and chromosomal sex can be in direct
contradiction.*

5.     Chromosomal sex is not only XX or XY. There are other
chromosomal formations, and not much is known about them or what they
signify.

6.     A person can have the gonads of one sex, and the secondary
sexual characteristics of the other sex.

7.     Men and women both produce male and female hormones. The amounts
and proportions vary greatly, and there is no way to determine
biological maleness or femaleness from hormone count.

8.     One hormone can be transformed by the body into its "opposite, "
male into female, female into male. In
Sex, Ann Oakley
gives this example:

> > \... the fact that rapidly maturing male adolescents sometimes
> > acquire small breasts ---the substantial increases in testosterone
> > which accompanies puberty \are\ partially metabolised as
> > oestrogen, which in turn causes breast development. ^2^
>
9.     It is now thought that the male hormone determines the sex drive
in both men and women.

10.     The female hormone (progesterone) can have a masculinizing
effect. Dr. Sherfey writes:

>
11.     Visible sex differences are not discrete. There are men with
tiny cocks, women with large clits. There are men with highly developed
breasts, women with almost no breast development. There are men with
wide hips, women with no noticeable hip development. There are men with
virtually no body hair, women with much body hair. There are men with
high voices, women with low voices. There are men with no facial hair,
women who have beards and mustaches.

12.     Height and weight differences between men and women are not
discrete. Muscle structures are not discrete. We know the despair of the
tall, muscular woman who does not fit the female stereotype; we know
also the despair of the small, delicate man who does not fit the male
stereotype.

13.     There is compelling cross-cultural evidence that muscle
strength and development are culturally determined. There are
cultures in which there are no great differences in somatotype of men
and women:

14.  There are hermaphrodites in nature. Robert T. Francoeur,
in Utopian Motherhood: New Trends in Human
Reproduction

>
We have seen how deep the commitment to human sexual discreteness and
polarity goes ---that commitment makes the idea of functional
hermaphroditism conceptually intolerable. It is interesting here to
speculate on the perceptions of men like Lionel Tiger (Men in
Groups) who in effect project human cultural patterns of
dominance and submission on the animal world. For instance, Dr. Sherfey
tells us that
the females would be diagnosed hermaphrodites if they were
human" (Italics hers. ) ^6^ Most probably, we often simply
project our own culturally determined modes of acting and perceiving
onto other animals ---we effectively screen information that would
challenge the notions of male and female which are holy to us. In that
case, a bias toward androgyny (instead of the current bias toward
polarity) would give us significantly different scenarios of animal
behavior.

Hermaphroditism is generally defined as "a congenital disorder in which
both male and female generative organs exist in the same individual. "
^7^ A "true" hermaphrodite is one who has ovaries, testes, and the
secondary sexual characteristics of both sexes. But this is, it seems to
me, the story of a functional hermaphrodite:

>
Parthenogenesis also occurs naturally in women. Fran-coeur refers to
the work of Dr. Landrum B. Shettles who

On the basis of Shettles' work, Francoeur estimates

> > twins occur among white Americans.
> > ^10^
>
Seemingly a conservative, Dr. Sherwood Taylor, a British scientist,
"has suggested a much lower frequency for human parthenogenesis,
estimating one case in ten thousand births. "^11^ However much, however
little, it does occur.

We can presume then that there is a great deal about human sexuality to
be discovered, and that our notion of two discrete biological sexes
cannot remain intact. We can presume then that we will discover
cross-sexed phenomena in proportion to our ability to see them. In
addition, we can account for the relative rarity of hermaphrodites in
the general population, for the consistency of male-female somatotypes
that we do find, and for the relative rarity of cross-sexed
characteristics in the general population (though they occur with more
frequency than we are now willing to imagine) by recognizing that there
is a process of
which, for people, supersedes natural selection in importance. Cultural
selection, as opposed to natural selection, does not necessarily serve
to improve the species or to ensure survival. It does necessarily serve
to uphold cultural norms and to ensure that deviant somatotypes and
cross-sexed characteristics are systematically bred out of the
population.

However we look at it, whatever we choose to make out of the data of
what is frequently called Intersex, it is clear that sex determination
is not always clearcut and simple. Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins
University has basically isolated these six aspects of sex
identity:

> > 1. *Genetic or nuclear sexuality* as revealed by indicators like

>
Since there can be total contradiction between/among any of the above,
since we have discussed some (by no means all) of the cross-sexed
characteristics of human biological functioning, since we recognize
hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis as human realities, we are justified
in making a radical new formulation of the nature of human
sexuality.
*clearly* *a
multi**sexed species which has its sexuality
spread along a vast fluid continuum where the elements called male and
female are not discrete.* ^\*^

The concrete implications of multisexuality as we find it articulated
in both androgynous mythology and biology necessitate the total
redefinition of scenarios of proper human sexual behavior and pragmatic
forms of human community. If human beings are multisexed, then all forms
of sexual interaction which are directly rooted in the multisexual
nature of people must be part of the fabric of human life, accepted into
the lexicon of human possibility, integrated into the forms of human
community. By redefining human sexuality, or by defining it correctly,
we can transform human relationship and the institutions which seek to
control that relationship. Sex as the power dynamic between men and
women, its primary form sadomasochism, is what we know now. Sex as
community between humans, our shared humanity, is the world we must
build. What kind of sexual identity and relation will be the substance
of that community?

I have defined heterosexuality as the ritualized behavior built on
polar role definition. Intercourse with men as we know them is
increasingly impossible. It requires an aborting of creativity and
strength, a refusal of responsibility and freedom: a bitter personal
death. It means remaining the victim, forever annihilating all
self-respect. It means acting out the female role, incorporating the
masochism, self-hatred, and passivity which are central to it.
Unambiguous conventional heterosexual behavior is the worst betrayal of
our common humanity.

That is not to say that "men" and "women" should not fuck. Any sexual
coming together which is genuinely pansexual and role-free, even if
between men and women as we generally think of them (i. e., the
biological images we have of them), is authentic and androgynous.
Specifically, *androgynous fucking requires the
destruction **of all conventional role-playing, of genital
sexuality as the primary focus and value, of couple formations, and of
the personality structures dominant-active*
*("* *and
sub-missive-passive ("female").*

Homosexuality, because it is by definition antagonistic to two-sex
polarity, is closer at its inception to androgynous sexuality. However,
since all individual consciousness and social relationship are polluted
by internalized notions of polarity, coupling, and role-playing, the
criteria cited above must also be applied to homosexual relation. Too
often homosexual relation transgresses gender imperatives without
transforming them.

An exclusive commitment to one sexual formation, whether homosexual or
heterosexual, generally means an exclusive commitment to one role. An
exclusive commitment to one sexual formation generally involves the
denial of many profound and compelling kinds of sensuality. An exclusive
commitment to one sexual formation generally means that one is,
regardless of the uniform one wears, a good soldier of the culture
programmed effectively to do its dirty work. It is by developing one's
pansexuality to its limits (and no one knows where or what those are)
that one does the work of destroying culture to build
community.

A transsexual friend, in a conversation

Transsexuality is currently considered a gender disorder, that is, a
person learns a gender role which contradicts his/her visible sex. It is
a "disease" with a cure: a sex-change operation will change the person's
visible sex and make it consonant with the person's felt
identity.

Since we know very little about sex identity, and since psychiatrists
are committed to the propagation of the cultural structure as it is, it
would be premature and not very intelligent to accept the psychiatric
judgment that transsexuality is caused by faulty socialization. More
probably transsexuality is caused by a faulty society. Transsexuality
can be defined as one particular formation of our general multisexuality
which is unable to achieve its natural development because of extremely
adverse social conditions.

There is no doubt that in the culture of male-female discreteness,
transsexuality is a disaster for the individual transsexual. Every
transsexual, white, black, man, woman, rich, poor, is in a state of
primary emergency (see p. 185) as a transsexual. There are 3 crucial
points here. One, every transsexual has the right to survival on his/her
own terms. That means that every transsexual is entitled to a sex-change
operation, and it should be provided by the community as one of its
functions. This is an emergency measure for an emergency condition. Two,
by changing our premises about men and women, role-playing, and
polarity, the social situation of transsexuals will be transformed, and
transsexuals will be integrated into community, no longer persecuted and
despised. Three, community built on androgynous identity will mean the
end of transsexuality as we know it. Either the transsexual
will be able to expand his/her sexuality into a fluid androgyny, or, as
roles disappear, the phenomenon of transsexuality will disappear and
that energy will be transformed into new modes of sexual identity and
behavior.

Julian Beck

Transvestism is costuming which violates gender imperatives.
Transvestism is generally a sexually charged act: the visible, public
violation of sex role is erotic, exciting, dangerous. It is a kind of
erotic civil disobedience, and that is precisely its value. Costuming is
part of the strategy and process of role destruction. We see, for
instance, that as women reject the female role, they adopt "male"
clothing. As sex roles dissolve, the particular erotic content of
transvestism dissolves.

G. Rattray-Taylor,

Primary bestiality (fucking between people and other animals) is found
in all nonindustrial societies. Secondary bestiality (generalized erotic
relationships between people and other animals) is found
everywhere on the planet, on every city street, in every
rural town. Bestiality is an erotic reality, one which clearly places
people in nature, not above
it.

The relationship between people and other animals, when nonpredatory,
is always erotic since its substance is nonverbal communication and
touch. That eroticism in its pure form is life-affirming and
life-enriching was sufficient reason to make bestiality a capital crime
in the Dark Ages, at least for the nonhuman animal; sufficient reason
for the English in the Dark Ages to confuse sheep and Jews.

In contemporary society relationships between people and other animals
often reflect the sadomasochistic complexion of human relationship.
Animals in our culture are often badly abused, the objects of violence
and cruelty, the foil of repressed and therefore very dangerous human
sexuality. Some animals, like horses and big dogs, become surrogate
cocks, symbols of ideal macho virility.

Needless to say, in androgynous community, human and other-animal
relationships would become more explicitly erotic, and that eroticism
would not degenerate into abuse. Animals would be part of the tribe and,
with us, respected, loved, and free. They always share our fate,
whatever it is.

Allen Ginsberg,

The parent-child relationship is primarily erotic because all human
relationships are primarily erotic. The incest taboo is a particularized
form of repression, one which functions as the bulwark of all the other
repressions. The incest taboo ensures that however free we become, we
never become genuinely free. The incest taboo, because it denies us
essential fulfillment with the parents whom we love with our primary
energy, forces us to internalize those parents and constantly seek them,
or seek to negate them, in the minds, bodies, and hearts of other humans
who are not our parents and never will be.

The incest taboo does the worst work of the culture: it teaches us the
mechanisms of repressing and internalizing erotic feeling---it forces us
to develop those mechanisms in the first place; it forces us to
particularize sexual feeling, so that it congeals into a need for a
particular sexual "object"; it demands that we place the nuclear family
above the human family. The destruction of the incest taboo is essential
to the development of cooperative human community based on the free-flow
of natural androgynous eroticism.

Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of
Sex

The incest taboo can be destroyed only by destroying the nuclear family
as the primary institution of the culture. The nuclear family is the
school of values in a sexist, sexually repressed society. One learns
what one must know: the roles, rituals, and behaviors appropriate to
male-female polarity and the internalized mechanisms of sexual
repression. The alternative to the nuclear family at the moment is the
extended family, or tribe. The growth of tribe is part of the process of
destroying particularized roles and fixed erotic identity. As people
develop fluid androgynous identity, they will also develop the forms of
community appropriate to it. We cannot really imagine what those forms
will be.

Sex\


Two developments are occurring simultaneously: women are rejecting the
female role, and life is being created in the laboratory. Unless the
structure is totally transformed, we can expect that when women no
longer function as biological breeders we will be expendable.
As learn more and more to control
reproduction, as cloning becomes a reality, and as the technology of
computers and robots develop, there is every reason to think that men as
we know them will use that control and technology to create the sex
objects that will gratify them. Men, after all, nave throughout history
resorted to gynocide as a stratagem of social control, as a tactical way
of attaining/maintaining power. That is the simple, compelling reality.
There are only two other options: women must seize power, or we must
accomplish the transformation into androgyny.

The freedom of those who are capable of biological reproduction from
that work (which is simply a form of physical labor) is entirely
congruent with androgynous community. Only in the concentration-camp
world of polarity must one expect that development to lead to gynocide.
The social processes here stand naked: if women must seize power in
order to survive, and somehow manage to do that, power will most
probably shift without being transformed; if we can create androgynous
community, we can abandon power altogether as a social reality ---that
is the final, and most important, implication of androgyny.

As for children, they too are erotic beings, closer to androgyny than
the adults who oppress them. Children are fully capable of participating
in community, and have every right to live out their own erotic
impulses. In androgynous community, those impulses would retain a high
degree of nonspecificity and would no doubt show the rest of us the way
into sexual self-realization. The distinctions between "children" and
"adults, " and the social institutions which enforce those distinctions,
would disappear as androgynous community develops.



> > Nothing short of everything will really do.
> >
Aldous Huxley,

The object is cultural transformation. The object is the development of
a new kind of human being and a new kind of human community. All of us
who have ever tried to right a wrong recognize that truly nothing short
of everything will really do.

The way from here to there will not be easy. We must make a total
commitment ---no longer to take refuge in the scenarios of man-woman
violence which are society's regulators, no longer to play the
male-female roles we have been taught, no longer to refuse to know who
we are and what we desire so that we need not take responsibility for
our own lives. We must refuse to submit to those institutions which are
by definition sexist ---marriage, the nuclear family, religions built on
the myth of feminine evil. We must refuse to submit to the fears
engendered by sexual taboos. We must refuse to submit to all forms of
behavior and relationship which reinforce male-female polarity, which
nourish basic patterns of male dominance and female submission. We must
instead build communities where violence is not the main dynamic of
human relationship, where natural desire is the fundament of community,
where androgyny is the operative premise, where tribe based on androgyny
and the social forms which would develop from it are the bases of the
collective cultural structure ---noncoercive, nonsexist. As Julian Beck
wrote, the journey to love is not romantic. As many have written, the
journey to freedom is not romantic either --- nor is the way known
precisely and for all time. We begin here and now, inch by
inch.

AFTERWORD {.font8
style="font-weight:bold;"}

**The Great Punctuation Typography Struggle**

this text has been altered in one very serious way. I wanted it to be
printed the way it was written ---lower case letters, no apostrophes,
contractions.

I like my text to be as empty as possible, only necessary punctuation
is necessary, when one knows ones purposes one knows what is
necessary.

my publisher, in his corporate wisdom, filled the pages with garbage:
standard punctuation, he knew his purposes; he knew what was necessary,
our purposes differed: mine, to achieve clarity; his, to sell
books.

my publisher changed my punctuation because book reviewers (Mammon) do
not like lower case letters, fuck (in the old sense) book reviewers
(Mammon).

Gertrude Stein

in a letter to me, Grace Paley wrote, "once everyone tells the truth
artists will be unnecessary ---meanwhile there's work for us.
" 

telling the truth, we know what it is when we do it and when we learn
not to do it we forget what it
is.

form, shape, structure, spatial relation, how the printed word appears
on the page, where to breathe, where to rest, punctuation is marking
time, indicating rhythms, even in my original text I used too much of
it --- I overorchestrated. I forced you to breathe where I
do, instead of letting you discover your own natural
breath.

I begin by presuming that I am free.

I begin with nothing, no form, no content, and I ask: what do I want to
do and how do I want to do it.

I begin by presuming that what I write belongs to me.

I begin by presuming that I determine the form I use ---in all its
particulars. I work at my craft ---in all its particulars.

in fact, everything is already determined, in fact, all the particulars
have been determined and are enforced.

in fact, where I violate what has already been determined I will be
stopped.

in fact, the enforcers will enforce.

Franz Kafka

I presume that I am free. I act. the enforcers enforce. I discover that
I am not free, then: either I lie (it is necessary to lie) or I struggle
(if I do not lie, I must struggle), if I struggle, I ask, why am I not
free and what can I do to become free? I wrote this book to find out why
I am not free and what I can do to become free.

> warmth. Ultimately the law is enforced by the unfeeling
> guard punching his fellow man hard in the
> belly.

Judith Malina

without the presumption of freedom, there is no freedom. I am free,
how, then, do I want to live my life, do my work, use my body? how,
then, do I want to be, in all my particulars?

standard forms are imposed in dress, behavior, sexual relation,
punctuation. standard forms are imposed on consciousness and
behavior---on knowing and expressing---so that we will not presume
freedom, so that freedom will appear ---in all its particulars ---
impossible and unworkable, so that we will not know what telling the
truth is, so that we will not feel compelled to tell it, so that we will
spend our time and our holy human energy telling the necessary
lies.

standard forms are sometimes called conventions, conventions are
mightier than armies, police, and prisons. each citizen becomes the
enforcer, the doorkeeper, an instrument of the Law, an unfeeling guard
punching his fellow man hard in the belly.

> I am an anarchist. I dont sue, I dont get injunctions, I advocate
> revolution, and when people ask me what can we do that's practical, I
> say, weakly, weaken the fabric of the system wherever you can, make
> possible the increase of freedom, all kinds. When I write I try to
> extend the possibilities of expression.

> \... I had tried to speak to you honestly, in my own way,
> undisguised, trying to get rid, it's part of my obligation to the
> muse, of the ancien regime of grammar.

> \... the revisions in typography and punctuation have taken from the
> voice the difference that distinguishes passion from affection and me
> speaking to you from me writing an essay.

Julian Beck, 1965, in a foreword to an edition of The
Brig

**BELIEVE THE PUNCTUATION.**

Muriel Rukeyser

there is a great deal at stake here, many writers fight this battle and
most lose it. what is at stake for the writer? freedom of invention,
freedom to tell the truth, in all its particulars, freedom to imagine
new structures.

(the burden of proof is not on those who presume freedom, the burden of
proof is on those who would in any way diminish it. )

what is at stake for the enforcers, the doorkeepers, the guardians of
the Law---the publishing corporations, the book reviewers who do not
like lower case letters, the librarians who will not stack books without
standard punctuation (that was the reason given Muriel Rukeyser when her
work was violated)---what is at stake for them? why do they continue to
enforce?

while this book may meet much resistance---anger, fear, dislike---law?
police? courts? ---at this moment I must write: Ive attacked the
fundaments of culture, thats ok. Ive attacked male dominance, thats ok.
Ive attacked every heterosexual notion of relation, thats ok. Ive in
effect advocated the use of drugs, thats ok. Ive in effect advocated
fucking animals, thats ok. here and now, New York City, spring 1974,
among a handful of people, publisher and editor included, thats ok.
lower case letters are not. it does make one wonder.

so Ive wondered and this is what I think right now. there are
well-developed, effective mechanisms for dealing with ideas, no matter
how powerful the ideas are. very few ideas are more powerful than the
mechanisms for defusing them, standard form ---punctuation, typography,
then on to academic organization, the rigid ritualistic formulation of
ideas, etc. ---is the actual distance between the individual (certainly
the intellectual individual) and the ideas in a book. 

standard form is the distance. 

one can be excited ideas without changing
at all. one can think
about ideas, without changing at all. people are willing to
think about many things, what people refuse to do, or are not permitted
to do, or resist doing, is to change the way they think.

reading a text which violates standard form forces one to change mental
sets in order to read. there is no distance. the new form, which is in
some ways unfamiliar, forces one to read differently---not to
read different things, but to read in
different ways.

to permit writers to use forms which violate convention just might
permit writers to develop forms which would teach people to think
differently: not to think about different things, but to think in
different ways. that work is not permitted.

> If it had been possible to build the Tower of Babel without ascending
> it, the work would have been permitted.

Franz Kafka

> The Immovable Structure is the villain. Whether that structure calls
> itself a prison or a school or a factory or a family or a government
> or The World As It Is. That structure asks each man what he can do for
> it, not what it can do for him, and for those who do not do for it,
> there is the pain of death or imprisonment, or social degradation, or
> the loss of animal rights.

Judith Malina

this book is about the Immovable Sexual Structure, in the process of
having it published, Ive encountered the Immovable Punctuation
Typography Structure, and I now testify, as so many have before me, that
the Immovable Structure aborts freedom, prohibits invention, and does us
verifiable harm: it uses our holy human energy to sustain itself; it
turns us into enforcers, or outlaws; to survive, we must learn to
lie.

The Revolution, as we live it and as we imagine it, means destroying
the Immovable Structure to create a world in which we can use our holy
human energy to sustain our holy human lives;

to create a world without enforcers, doorkeepers, guards, and arbitrary
Law;

to create a world ---a community on this planet--- where instead of
lying to survive, we can tell the truth and flourish.
