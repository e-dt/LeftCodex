.sgc-1}

[There is a rumor, circulated for centuries by scientists, artists, and
philosophers both secular and religious, a piece of gossip as it were,
to the effect that women are "biologically conservative. " While gossip
among women is universally ridiculed as low and trivial, gossip among
men, especially if it is about women, is called theory, or idea, or
fact. This particular rumor became dignified as high thought because it
was Whispered-Down-The-Lane in formidable academies, libraries, and
meeting halls from which women, until very recently, have been formally
and forcibly excluded.]{.font3}

[The whispers, however multisyllabic and footnoted they sometimes are,
reduced to a simple enough set of assertions. Women have children
because women by definition have children. This "fact of life, " which
is not subject to qualification, carries with it the instinctual
obligation to nurture and protect those children. Therefore, women can
be expected to be socially, politically, economically, and sexually
conservative because the status quo, whatever it is, is safer than
change, whatever the change. Noxious male philosophers from all
disciplines have, for centuries, maintained that women follow a
biological imperative derived directly from their reproductive
capacities that translates necessarily into narrow lives, small minds,
and a rather meanspirited puritanism.]{.font3}

[This theory, or slander, is both specious and cruel in that, in fact,
women are forced to bear children and have been throughout history in
all economic systems, with but teeny-weeny time-outs while the men were
momentarily disoriented, as, for instance, in the immediate postcoital
aftermath of certain revolutions. It is entirely irrational in that, in
fact, women of all ideological persuasions, with the single exception of
absolute pacifists, of whom there have not been very many, have
throughout history supported wars in which the very children they are
biologically ordained to protect are maimed, raped, tortured, and
killed. Clearly, the biological explanation of the so-called
conservative nature of women obscures the realities of women's lives,
buries them in dark shadows of distortion and dismissal.]{.font3}

[The disinterested or hostile male observer can categorize women as
"conservative" in some metaphysical sense because it is true that women
as a class adhere rather strictly to the traditions and values of their
social context, whatever the character of that context. In societies of
whatever description, however narrowly or broadly defined, women as a
class are the dulled conformists, the orthodox believers, the obedient
followers, the disciples of unwavering faith. To waver, whatever the
creed of the men around them, is tantamount to rebellion; it is
dangerous. Most women, holding on for dear life, do not dare abandon
blind faith. From father's house to husband's house to a grave that
still might not be her own, a woman acquiesces to male authority in
order to gain some protection from male violence. She conforms, in order
to be as safe as she can be. Sometimes it is a lethargic conformity, in
which case male demands slowly close in on her, as if she were a
character buried alive in an Edgar Allan Poe story. Sometimes it is a
militant conformity. She will save herself by proving that she is loyal,
obedient, useful, even fanatic in the service of the men around her. She
is the happy hooker, the happy homemaker, the exemplary Christian, the
pure academic, the perfect comrade, the terrorist par excellence.
Whatever the values, she will embody them with a perfect fidelity. The
males rarely keep their part of the bargain as she understands it:
protection from male violence against her person. But the militant
conformist has given so much of herself---her labor, heart, soul, often
her body, often children---that this betrayal is akin to nailing the
coffin shut; the corpse is beyond caring.]{.font3}

[Women know, but must not acknowledge, that resisting male control or
confronting male betrayal will lead to rape, battery, destitution,
ostracization or exile, confinement in a mental institution or jail, or
death. As Phyllis Chesler and Emily Jane Goodman make clear in]{.font3}
[Women]{.font3}[,]{.font3} [Money]{.font3}[,]{.font3} [and
Power]{.font3}[, women struggle, in the manner of Sisyphus, to avoid the
"something worse" that can and will always happen to them if they
transgress the rigid boundaries of appropriate female behavior. Most
women cannot afford, either materially or psychologically, to recognize
that whatever burnt offerings of obedience they bring to beg protection
will not appease the angry little gods around them.]{.font3}

[It is not surprising, then, that most girls do not want to become like
their mothers, those tired, preoccupied domestic sergeants beset by
incomprehensible troubles. Mothers raise daughters to conform to the
strictures of the conventional female life as defined by men, whatever
the ideological values of the men. Mothers are the immediate enforcers
of male will, the guards at the cell door, the flunkies who administer
the electric shocks to punish rebellion.]{.font3}

[Most girls, however much they resent their mothers, do become very much
like them. Rebellion can rarely survive the aversion therapy that passes
for being brought up female. Male violence acts directly on the girl
through her father or brother or uncle or any number of male
professionals or strangers, as it did and does on her mother, and she
too is forced to learn to conform in order to survive. A girl may, as
she enters adulthood, repudiate the particular set of males with whom
her mother is allied, run with a different pack as it were, but she will
replicate her mother's patterns in acquiescing to male authority within
her own chosen set. Using both force and threat, men in all camps demand
that women accept abuse in silence and shame, tie themselves to hearth
and home with rope made of self-blame, unspoken rage, grief, and
resentment.]{.font3}

[It is the fashion among men to despise the smallness of women's lives.
The so-called bourgeois woman with her shallow vanity, for instance, is
a joke to the brave intellectuals, truck drivers, and revolutionaries
who have wider horizons on which to project and indulge deeper vanities
that women dare not mock and to which women dare not aspire. The
fishwife is a vicious caricature of the small-mindedness and material
greed of the working-class wife who harasses her humble, hardworking,
ever patient husband with petty tirades of insult that no gentle rebuke
can mellow. The Lady, the Aristocrat, is a polished, empty shell, good
only for spitting at, because spit shows up on her clean exterior, which
gives immediate gratification to the spitter, whatever his technique.
The Jewish mother is a monster who wants to cut the phallus of her
precious son into a million pieces and put it in the chicken soup. The
black woman, also a castrator, is a grotesque matriarch whose sheer
endurance desolates men. The lesbian is half monster, half moron: having
no man to nag, she imagines herself Napoleon.]{.font3}

[And the derision of female lives does not stop with these toxic, ugly,
insidious slanders because there is always, in every circumstance, the
derision in its skeletal form, all bone, the meat stripped clean: she is
pussy, cunt. Every other part of the body is cut away, severed, and
there is left a thing, not human, an it, which is the funniest joke of
all, an unending source of raucous humor to those who have done the
cutting. The very butchers who cut up the meat and throw away the
useless parts are the comedians. The paring down of a whole person to
vagina and womb and then to a dismembered obscenity is their best and
favorite joke.]{.font3}

[Every woman, no matter what her social, economic, or sexual situation,
fights this paring down with every resource at her command. Because her
resources are so astonishingly meager and because she has been deprived
of the means to organize and expand them, these attempts are
simultaneously heroic and pathetic. The whore, in defending the pimp,
finds her own worth in the light reflected from his gaudy baubles. The
wife, in defending the husband, screams or stammers that her life is not
a wasteland of murdered possibilities. The woman, in defending the
ideologies of men who rise by climbing over her prone body in military
formation, will not publicly mourn the loss of what those men have taken
from her: she will not scream out as their heels dig into her flesh
because to do so would mean the end of meaning itself; all the ideals
that motivated her to deny herself would be indelibly stained with blood
that she would have to acknowledge, at last, as her own.]{.font3}

[So the woman hangs on, not with the delicacy of a clinging vine, but
with a tenacity incredible in its intensity, to the very persons,
institutions, and values that demean her, degrade her, glorify her
powerlessness, insist upon constraining and paralyzing the most honest
expressions of her will and being. She becomes a lackey, serving those
who ruthlessly and effectively aggress against her and her kind. This
singularly self-hating loyalty to those committed to her own destruction
is the very essence of womanhood as men of all ideological persuasions
define it.]{.font3}

[\*]{.font3}

[Marilyn Monroe, shortly before she died, wrote in her notebook on the
set of]{.font3} [Let\'s Make Love:]{.font3} ["What am I afraid of? Why
am I so afraid? Do I think I can't act? I know I can act but I am
afraid. I am afraid and I should not be and I must not be. "^1^]{.font3}

[The actress is the only female culturally empowered to act. When she
acts well, that is, when she convinces the male controllers of images
and wealth that she is reducible to current sexual fashion, available to
the male on his own terms, she is paid and honored. Her acting must be
imitative, not creative; rigidly conforming, not self-generated and
self-renewing. The actress is the puppet of flesh, blood, and paint who
acts as if she is the female acting. Monroe, the consummate sexual doll,
is empowered to act but afraid to act, perhaps because no amount of
acting, however inspired, can convince the actor herself that her ideal
female life is not a dreadful form of dying. She grinned, she posed, she
pretended, she had affairs with famous and powerful men. A friend of
hers claimed that she had so many illegal abortions wrongly performed
that her reproductive organs were severely injured. She died alone,
possibly acting on her own behalf for the first time. Death, one
imagines, numbs pain that barbiturates and alcohol cannot
touch.]{.font3}

[Monroe's premature death raised one haunting question for the men who
were, in their own fantasy, her lovers, for the men who had masturbated
over those pictures of exquisite female compliance: was it possible,
could it be, that she hadn't liked It all along---It---the It they had
been doing to her, how many millions of times? Had those smiles been
masks covering despair or rage? If so, how endangered they had been to
be deceived, so fragile and exposed in their masturbatory delight, as if
she could leap out from those photos of what was now a corpse and take
the revenge they knew she deserved. There arose the male imperative that
Monroe must not be a suicide. Norman Mailer, savior of masculine
privilege and pride on many fronts, took up the challenge by theorizing
that Monroe may have been killed by the FBI, or CIA, or whoever killed
the Kennedys, because she had been mistress to one or both. Conspiracy
was a cheerful and comforting thought to those who had wanted to slam
into her until she expired, female death and female ecstasy being
synonymous in the world of male metaphor. But they did not want her dead
yet, not really dead, not while the illusion of her open invitation was
so absolutely compelling. In fact, her lovers in both flesh and fantasy
had fucked her to death, and her apparent suicide stood at once as
accusation and answer: no, Marilyn Monroe, the ideal sexual female, had
not liked it.]{.font3}

[People---as we are always reminded by counterfeit egalitarians--- have
always died too young, too soon, too isolated, too full of insupportable
anguish. But only women die one by one, whether famous or obscure, rich
or poor, isolated, choked to death by the lies tangled in their throats.
Only women die one by one, attempting until the last minute to embody an
ideal imposed upon them by men who want to use them up. Only women die
one by one, smiling up to the last minute, smile of the siren, smile of
the coy girl, smile of the madwoman. Only women die one by one, polished
to perfection or unkempt behind locked doors too desperately ashamed to
cry out. Only women die one by one, still believing that if only they
had been perfect---perfect wife, mother, or whore---they would not have
come to hate life so much, to find it so strangely difficult and empty,
themselves so hopelessly confused and despairing. Women die, mourning
not the loss of their own lives, but their own inexcusable inability to
achieve perfection as men define it for them. Women desperately try to
embody a male-defined feminine ideal because survival depends on it. The
ideal, by definition, turns a woman into a function, deprives her of any
individuality that is self-serving or self-created, not useful to the
male in his scheme of things. This monstrous female quest for
male-defined perfection, so intrinsically hostile to freedom and
integrity, leads inevitably to bitterness, paralysis, or death, but like
the mirage in the desert, the life-giving oasis that is not there,
survival is promised in this conformity and nowhere else.]{.font3}

[Like the chameleon, the woman must blend into her environment, never
calling attention to the qualities that distinguish her, because to do
so would be to attract the predator's deadly attention. She is, in fact,
hunted meat---all the male]{.font3} [auteurs]{.font3}[, scientists, and
homespun philosophers on street corners will say so proudly. Attempting
to strike a bargain, the woman says: I come to you on your own terms.
Her hope is that his murderous attention will focus on a female who
conforms less artfully, less willingly. In effect, she ransoms the
remains of a life---what is left over after she has renounced willful
individuality---by promising indifference to the fate of other women.
This sexual, sociological, and spiritual adaptation, which is, in fact,
the maiming of all moral capacity, is the primary imperative of survival
for women who live under male-supremacist rule.]{.font3}

[Terrence Des Pres,]{.font2 .sgc-1} [The Survivor:\
An Anatomy of Life in the Death Camps]{.font2 .sgc-1}

[The accounts of rape, wife beating, forced childbearing, medical
butchering, sex-motivated murder, forced prostitution, physical
mutilation, sadistic psychological abuse, and the other commonplaces of
female experience that are excavated from the past or given by
contemporary survivors should leave the heart seared, the mind in
anguish, the conscience in upheaval. But they do not. No matter how
often these stories are told, with whatever clarity or eloquence,
bitterness or sorrow, they might as well have been whispered in wind or
written in sand: they disappear, as if they were nothing. The tellers
and the stories are ignored or ridiculed, threatened back into silence
or destroyed, and the experience of female suffering is buried in
cultural invisibility and contempt. Because women's testimony is not and
cannot be validated by the witness of men who have experienced the same
events and given them the same value, the very reality of abuse
sustained by women, despite its overwhelming pervasiveness and
constancy, is negated. It is negated in the transactions of everyday
life, and it is negated in the history books, left out, and it is
negated by those who claim to care about suffering but are blind to this
suffering.]{.font3}

[The problem, simply stated, is that one must believe in the existence
of the person in order to recognize the authenticity of her suffering.
Neither men nor women believe in the existence of women as significant
beings. It is impossible to remember as real the suffering of someone
who by definition has no legitimate claim to dignity or freedom, someone
who is in fact viewed as some thing, an object or an absence. And if a
woman, an individual woman multiplied by billions, does not believe in
her own discrete existence and therefore cannot credit the authenticity
of her own suffering, she is erased, canceled out, and the meaning of
her life, whatever it is, whatever it might have been, is lost. This
loss cannot be calculated or comprehended. It is vast and awful, and
nothing will ever make up for it.]{.font3}

[No one can bear to live a meaningless life. Women fight for meaning
just as women fight for survival: by attaching themselves to men and the
values honored by men. By committing themselves to male values, women
seek to acquire value. By advocating male meaning, women seek to acquire
meaning. Subservient to male will, women believe that subservience
itself is the meaning of a female life. In this way, women, whatever
they suffer, do not suffer the anguish of a conscious recognition that,
because they are women, they have been robbed of volition and choice,
without which no life can have meaning.]{.font3}

[\*]{.font3}

[The political Right in the United States today makes certain
metaphysical and material promises to women that both exploit and quiet
some of women's deepest fears. These fears originate in the perception
that male violence against women is uncontrollable and unpredictable.
Dependent on and subservient to men, women are always subject to this
violence. The Right promises to put enforceable restraints on male
aggression, thus simplifying survival for women---to make the world
slightly more habitable, in other words---by offering the
following:]{.font3}

[*Form*.]{.font3} [Women experience the world as mystery. Kept ignorant
of technology, economics, most of the practical skills required to
function autonomously, kept ignorant of the real social and sexual
demands made on women, deprived of physical strength, excluded from
forums for the development of intellectual acuity and public
self-confidence, women are lost and mystified by the savage momentum of
an ordinary life. Sounds, signs, promises, threats, wildly crisscross,
but what do they mean? The Right offers women a simple, fixed,
predetermined social, biological, and sexual order. Form conquers chaos.
Form banishes confusion. Form gives ignorance a shape, makes it look
like something instead of nothing.]{.font3}

[*Shelter*.]{.font3} [Women are brought up to maintain a husband's home
and to believe that women without men are homeless. Women have a deep
fear of being homeless---at the mercy of the elements and of strange
men. The Right claims to protect the home and the woman's place in
it.]{.font3}

[*Safety*.]{.font3} [For women, the world is a very dangerous place. One
wrong move, even an unintentional smile, can bring disaster---assault,
shame, disgrace. The Right acknowledges the reality of danger, the
validity of fear. The Right then manipulates the fear. The promise is
that if a woman is obedient, harm will not befall her.]{.font3}

[*Rules*.]{.font3} [Living in a world she has not made and docs not
understand, a woman needs rules to know what to do next. If she knows
what she is supposed to do, she can find a way to do it. If she learns
the rules by rote, she can perform with apparent effortlessness, which
will considerably enhance her chances for survival. The Right, very
considerately, tells women the rules of the game on which their lives
depend. The Right also promises that, despite their absolute
sovereignty, men too will follow specified rules.]{.font3}

[*Love*.]{.font3} [Love is always crucial in effecting the allegiance of
women. The Right offers women a concept of love based on order and
stability, with formal areas of mutual accountability. A woman is loved
for fulfilling her female functions: obedience is an expression of love
and so are sexual submission and childbearing. In return, the man is
supposed to be responsible for the material and emotional well-being of
the woman. And, increasingly, to redeem the cruel inadequacies of mortal
men, the Right offers women the love of Jesus, beautiful brother, tender
lover, compassionate friend, perfect healer of sorrow and resentment,
the one male to whom one can submit absolutely---be Woman as it
were---without being sexually violated or psychologically
abused.]{.font3}

[It is important and fascinating, of course, to note that women never,
no matter how deluded or needy or desperate, worship Jesus as the
perfect son. No faith is that blind. There is no religious or cultural
palliative to deaden the raw pain of the son's betrayal of the mother:
only her own obedience to the same father, the sacrifice of her own life
on the same cross, her own body nailed and bleeding, can enable her to
accept that her son, like Jesus, has come to do his Father's work.
Feminist Leah Fritz, in]{.font3} [Thinking Like a Woman]{.font3}[,
described the excruciating predicament of women who try to find worth in
Christian submission: "Unloved, unrespected, unnoticed by the Heavenly
Father, condescended to by the Son, and fucked by the Holy Ghost,
western woman spends her entire life trying to please. "^3^]{.font3}

[But no matter how hard she tries to please, it is harder still for her
to be pleased. In]{.font3} [Bless This House]{.font3}[, Anita Bryant
describes how each day she must ask Jesus to "help me love my husband
and children. "^4^ In]{.font3} [The Total Woman]{.font3}[, Marabel
Morgan explains that it is only through God's power that "we can love
and accept others, including our husbands. "^5^ In]{.font3} [The Gift of
Inner Healing]{.font3}[, Ruth Carter Stapleton counsels a young woman
who is in a desperately unhappy marriage: "Try to spend a little time
each day visualizing Jesus coming in the door from work. Then see
yourself walking up to him, embracing him. Say to Jesus, it's good to
have you home Nick. '"^6^]{.font3}

[Ruth Carter Stapleton married at nineteen. Describing the early years
of her marriage, she wrote:]{.font3}

> [After moving four hundred fifty miles from my first family in order
> to save my marriage, I found myself in a cold, threatening,
> unprotected world, or so it seemed to my confused heart. In an effort
> to avoid total destruction, I indulged in escapes of every
> kind\...]{.font3}

> [A major crisis arose when I discovered I was pregnant with my first
> child. I knew that this was supposed to be one of the crowning moments
> of womanhood, but not for me\.... When my baby was born, I wanted to
> be a good mother, but I felt even more trapped\.... Then three more
> babies were born in rapid succession, and each one, so beautiful,
> terrified me. I did love them, but by the fourth child I was at the
> point of total desperation. ^7^]{.font3}

[Apparently the birth of her fourth child occasioned her surrender to
Jesus. For a time, life seemed worthwhile. Then, a rupture in a
cherished friendship plummeted her into an intolerable depression.
During this period, she jumped out of a moving car in what she regards
as a suicide attempt.]{.font3}

[A male religious mentor picked up the pieces. Stapleton took her own
experience of breakdown and recovery and from it shaped a kind of faith
psychotherapy. Nick's transformation into Jesus has already been
mentioned. A male homosexual, traumatized by an absent father who never
played with him as a child, played baseball with Jesus under Stapleton's
tutelage---a whole nine innings. In finding Jesus as father and chum, he
was healed of the hurt of an absent father and "cured" of his
homosexuality. A woman who was forcibly raped by her father as a child
was encouraged to remember the event, only this time Jesus had his hand
on the father's shoulder and was forgiving him. This enabled the woman
to forgive her father too and to be reconciled with men. A woman who as
a child was rejected by her father on the occasion of her first
date---the father did not notice her pretty dress---was encouraged to
imagine the presence of Jesus on that fateful night. Jesus loved her
dress and found her very desirable. Stapleton claims that this
devotional therapy, through the power of the Holy Spirit, enables Jesus
to erase damaging memories.]{.font3}

[A secular analysis of Stapleton's own newfound well-being seems, by
contrast, pedestrian. A brilliant woman has found a socially acceptable
way to use her intellect and compassion in the public domain---the dream
of many women. Though fundamentalist male ministers have called her a
witch, in typical female fashion Stapleton disclaims responsibility for
her own inventiveness and credits the Holy Spirit, clearly male, thus
soothing the savage misogyny of those who cannot bear for any woman to
be both seen and heard. Also, having founded an evangelical ministry
that demands constant travel, Stapleton is rarely at home. She has not
given birth again.]{.font3}

[Marabel Morgan's description of her own miserable marriage in the years
preceding her discovery of God's will is best summarized in this one
sentence: "I was helpless and unhappy. "^8^ She describes years of
tension, conflict, boredom, and gloom. She took her fate into her own
hands by asking the not-yet-classic question, What do men want? Her
answer is stunningly accurate: "It is only when a woman surrenders her
life to her husband, reveres and worships him, and is willing to serve
him, that she becomes really beautiful to him. "^9^ Or, more
aphoristically, "A Total Woman caters to her man's special quirks,
whether it be in salads, sex, or sports. "^10^ Citing God as the
authority and submission to Jesus as the model, Morgan defines love as
"unconditional acceptance of \[a man\] and his feelings. "^11^]{.font3}

[Morgan's achievement in]{.font3} [The Total Woman]{.font3} [was to
isolate the basic sexual scenarios of male dominance and female
submission and to formulate a simple set of lessons, a pedagogy, that
teaches women how to act out those scenarios within the context of a
Christian value system: in other words, how to cater to male
pornographic fantasies in the name of Jesus Christ. As Morgan explains
in her own extraordinary prose style: "That great source book, the
Bible, states, 'Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled\...
'In other words, sex is for the marriage relationship only, but within
those bounds, anything goes. Sex is as clean and pure as eating cottage
cheese. "^12^ Morgan's detailed instructions on how to eat cottage
cheese, the most famous of which involves Saran Wrap, make clear that
female submission is a delicately balanced commingling of
resourcefulness and lack of self-respect. Too little resourcefulness or
too much self-respect will doom a woman to failure as a Total Woman. A
submissive nature is the miracle for which religious women
pray.]{.font3}

[No one has prayed harder, longer, and with less apparent success than
Anita Bryant. She has spent a good part of her life on her knees begging
Jesus to forgive her for the sin of existing. In]{.font3} [Mine Eyes
Have Seen the Glory]{.font3}[, an autobiography first published in 1970,
Bryant described herself as an aggressive, stubborn, bad-tempered child.
Her early childhood was spent in brutal poverty. Through singing she
began earning money when still a child. When she was very young, her
parents divorced, then later remarried. When she was thirteen, her
father abandoned her mother, younger sister, and herself, her parents
were again divorced, and shortly thereafter her father remarried. At
thirteen, "\[w\]hat stands out most of all in my memory are my feelings
of intense ambition and a relentless drive to succeed at doing well the
thing I loved \[singing\]. "^13^ She blamed herself, especially her
driving ambition, for the loss of her father.]{.font3}

[She did not want to marry. In particular, she did not want to marry Bob
Green. He "won" her through a war of attrition. Every "No" on her part
was taken as a "Yes" by him. When, on several occasions, she told him
that she did not want to see him again, he simply ignored what she said.
Once, when she was making a trip to see a close male friend whom she
described to Green as her fiance, he booked passage on the same plane
and went along. He hounded her.]{.font3}

[Having got his hooks into her, especially knowing how to hit on her
rawest nerve---guilt over the abnormality of her ambition, by definition
unwomanly and potentially satanic---Green manipulated Bryant with a
cruelty nearly unmatched in modem love stories. From both of Bryant's
early books, a picture emerges. One sees a woman hemmed in, desperately
trying to please a husband who manipulates and harasses her and whose
control of her life on every level is virtually absolute. Bryant
described the degree of Green's control in]{.font3} [Mine Eyes:]{.font3}
["That's how good a manager my husband is. He willingly handles all the
business in my life---even to including the Lord's business. Despite our
sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it. "^14^ Bryant never
specifies how violent the violent scraps were, though Green insists they
were not violent. Green himself, in]{.font3} [Bless This
House]{.font3}[, is very proud of spanking the children, especially the
oldest son, who is adopted: "I'm a father to my children, not a pal. I
assert my authority. I spank them at times, and they respect me for it.
Sometimes I take Bobby into the music room, and it's not so I can play
him a piece on the piano. We play a piece on the seat of his pants!
"^15^ Some degree of physical violence, then, was admittedly an accepted
part of domestic life. Bryant's unselfconscious narrative makes clear
that over a period of years, long before her antihomosexual crusade was
a glint in Bob Green's eye, she was badgered into giving public
religious testimonies that deeply distressed her:]{.font3}

> [Bob has a way of getting my dander up and backing me up against a
> wall. He gets me so terrifically mad at him that I hate him for
> pushing me into a corner. He did that now.]{.font3}

> ["You're a hypocrite, " Bob said. "You profess to have Christ in your
> life, but you won't profess Him in public, which Christ tells you to
> do. "]{.font3}

> [Because I know he's right, and hate him for making me feel so bad
> about it, I end up doing what I'm so scared to do. ^16^]{.font3}

[Conforming to the will of her husband was clearly a difficult struggle
for Bryant. She writes candidly of her near constant rebellion. Green's
demands---from increasing her public presence as religious witness to
doing all the child care for four children without help while pursuing
the career she genuinely loves---were endurable only because Bryant,
like Stapleton and Morgan, took Jesus as her real husband:]{.font3}

> [Only as I practice yielding to Jesus can I learn to submit, as the
> Bible instructs me, to the loving leadership of my husband. Only the
> power of Christ can enable a woman like me to become submissive in the
> Lord. ^17^]{.font3}

[In Bryant's case, the "loving leadership" of her husband, this time in
league with her pastor, enshrined her as the token spokeswoman of
antihomosexual bigotry. Once again Bryant was reluctant to testify, this
time before Dade County's Metropolitan Commission in hearings on a
homosexual-rights ordinance. Bryant spent several nights in tears and
prayer, presumably because, as she told]{.font3} [Newsweek]{.font3}[, "I
was scared and I didn't want to do it. "^18^ Once again, a desire to do
Christ's will brought her into conformity with the expressed will of her
husband. One could speculate that some of the compensation in this
conformity came from having the burdens of domestic work and child care
lessened in the interest of serving the greater cause. Conformity to the
will of Christ and Green, synonymous in this instance as so often
before, also offered an answer to the haunting question of her life: how
to be a public leader of significance---in her terminology, a "star"---
and at the same time an obedient wife acting to protect her children. A
singing career, especially a secular one, could never resolve this
raging conflict.]{.font3}

[Bryant, like all the rest of us, is trying to be a "good" woman.
Bryant, like all the rest of us, is desperate and dangerous, to herself
and to others, because "good" women live and die in silent selflessness
and real women cannot. Bryant, like all the rest of us, is having one
hell of a hard time.^\*^]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\* This analysis of Bryant's situation was written in 1978 and
published in Ms. in June 1979. In May 1980, Bryant filed for divorce. In
a statement issued separately from the divorce petition, she contended
that Green had "violated my most precious asset---my conscience" (The
New York Times, May 24, 1980). Within three weeks after the divorce
decree (August 1980), the state citrus agency of Florida, which Bryant
had represented for eleven years, decided she was no longer a suitable
representative because of her divorce: "The contract had to expire,
because of the divorce and so forth, " one agency executive said (The
New York Times, September 2, 1980). Feminist lawyer and former National
Organization for Women president Karen DeCrow urged Bryant to bring suit
under the 1977 Florida Human Rights Act, which prohibits job
discrimination on the basis of marital status. Even before DeCrow's
sisterly act, however, Bryant had reevaluated her position on the
women's movement, to which, under Green's tutelage, she had been
bitterly opposed. "What has happened to me, " Bryant told the National
Enquirer in June 1980, "makes me understand why there are angry women
who want to pass ERA \[Equal Rights Amendment\]. That still is not the
answer. But the church doesn't deal with the problems of women as it
should. There's been some really bad teachings, and I think that's why
I'm really concerned for my own children---particularly the girls. You
have to recognize that there has been discrimination against women, that
women have not had the teaching of the fullness and uniqueness of their
abilities. " *Pace*, sister.]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Phyllis Schlafly, the Right's not-born-again philosopher of the absurd,
is apparently not having a hard time. She seems possessed by
Machiavelli, not Jesus. It appears that she wants to be The Prince. She
might be viewed as that rare woman of any ideological persuasion who
really does see herself as one of the boys, even as she claims to be one
of the girls. Unlike most other right-wing women, Schlafly, in her
written and spoken work, does not acknowledge experiencing any of the
difficulties that tear women apart. In the opinion of many, her
ruthlessness as an organizer is best demonstrated by her demagogic
propaganda against the Equal Rights Amendment, though she also waxes
eloquent against reproductive freedom, the women's movement, big
government, and the Panama Canal Treaty. Her roots, and perhaps her
heart such as it is, are in the Old Right, but she remained unknown to
any significant public until she mounted her crusade against the Equal
Rights Amendment. It is likely that her ambition is to use women as a
constituency to effect entry into the upper echelon of right-wing male
leadership. She may yet discover that she is a woman (as feminists
understand the meaning of the word) as her male colleagues refuse to let
her escape the ghetto of female issues and enter the big time.^\*^ At
any rate, she seems to be able to manipulate the fears of women without
experiencing them. If this is indeed the case, this talent would give
her an invaluable, cold-blooded detachment as a strategist determined to
convert women into antifeminist activists. It is precisely because women
have been trained to respect and follow those who use them that Schlafly
inspires awe and devotion in women who are afraid that they will be
deprived of the form, shelter, safety, rules, and love that the Right
promises and on which they believe survival depends.]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\* According to many newspaper reports, Phyllis Schlafly wanted Reagan
to appoint her to a position in the Pentagon. This he did not do. In a
debate with Schlafly (Stanford University, January 26, 1982) lawyer
Catharine A. MacKinnon tried to make Schlafly understand that she had
been discriminated against as a woman: "Mrs. Schlafly tells us that
being a woman has not gotten in her way. I propose that any man who had
a law degree and graduate work in political science; had given testimony
on a wide range of important subjects for decades; had done effective
and brilliant political, policy and organizational work within the party
\[the Republican Party\]; had published widely, including nine books;
and stopped a major social initiative to amend the constitution just
short of victory dead in its tracks \[the Equal Rights Amendment\]; and
had a beautiful accomplished family---any man like that would have a
place in the current administration\.... I would accept correction if
this is wrong; and she may yet be appointed. She was widely reported to
have wanted such a post, but I don't believe everything I read,
especially about women. I do think she should have wanted one and they
should have found her a place she wanted. She certainly deserved a place
in the Defense Department. Phyllis Schlafly is a qualified woman. "
Answered Schlafly: "This has been an interesting debate. More
interesting than I thought it was going to be\.... I think my opponent
did have one good point---\[audience laughter\] Well, she had a couple
of good points\.... She did have a good point about the Reagan
administration, but it is the Reagan administration's loss that they
didn't ask me to \[drowned out by audience applause\] but it isn't my
loss. "\

[At the National Women's Conference (Houston, Texas, November 1977), I
spoke with many women on the Right. The conversations were ludicrous,
terrifying, bizarre, instructive, and, as other feminists have reported,
sometimes strangely moving.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women fear lesbians. A liberal black delegate from Texas
told me that local white women had tried to convince her that lesbians
at the conference would assault her, call her dirty names, and were
personally filthy. She told me that she would vote against the
sexual-preference resolution^\*^ because otherwise she would not be able
to return home. But she also said that she would tell the white women
that the lesbians had been polite and clean. She said that she knew it
was wrong to deprive anyone of a job and had had no idea before coming
to Houston that lesbian mothers lost their children. This, she felt, was
genuinely terrible. I asked her if she thought a time would come when
she would have to stand up for lesbian rights in her hometown. She
nodded yes gravely, then explained with careful, evocative emphasis that
the next-closest town to where she lived was 160 miles away. The history
of blacks in the South was palpable.]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\* "Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to
eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional
preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing,
public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding,
and the military.]{.font3}

["State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State
laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting
adults.]{.font3}

["State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit
consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any
judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather,
child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which
party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and
affectional orientation."]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Right-wing women consistently spoke to me about lesbians as if lesbians
were rapists, certified committers of sexual assault against women and
girls. No facts could intrude on this psychosexual fantasy. No facts or
figures on male sexual violence against women and children could change
the focus of their fear. They admitted that they knew of many cases of
male assault against females, including within families, and did not
know of any assaults by lesbians against females. The men, they
acknowledged when pressed, were sinners, and they hated sin, but there
was clearly something comforting in the normalcy of heterosexual rape.
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous, experienced almost as a
demonic sexual force hovering closer and closer. She was the dangerous
intruder, encroaching, threatening by her very presence a sexual order
that cannot bear scrutiny or withstand challenge.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women regard abortion as the callous murder of infants.
Female selflessness expresses itself in the conviction that a fertilized
egg surpasses an adult female in the authenticity of its existence. The
grief of these women for fetuses is real, and their contempt for women
who become pregnant out of wedlock is awesome to behold. The fact that
most illegal abortions in the bad old days were performed on married
women with children, and that thousands of those women died each year,
is utterly meaningless to them. They see abortion as a criminal act
committed by godless whores, women absolutely unlike
themselves.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women argue that passage of the Equal Rights Amendment will
legalize abortion irrevocably. No matter how often I heard this argument
(and I heard it constantly), I simply could not understand it. Fool that
I was, I had thought that the Equal Rights Amendment was abhorrent
because of toilets. Since toilets figured prominently in the resistance
to civil rights legislation that would protect blacks, the argument that
centered on toilets---while irrational---was as Amerikan as apple pie.
No one mentioned toilets. I brought them up, but no one cared to discuss
them. The passionate, repeated cause-and-effect arguments linking the
Equal Rights Amendment and abortion presented a new mystery. I resigned
myself to hopeless confusion. Happily, after the conference, I
read]{.font3} [The Power of the Positive Woman]{.font3}[, in which
Schlafly explains: "Since the mandate of ERA is for sex equality,
abortion is essential to relieve women of their unequal burden of being
forced to bear an unwanted baby. "^19^ Forcing women to bear unwanted
babies is crucial to the social program of women who have been forced to
bear unwanted babies and who cannot bear the grief and bitterness of
such a recognition. The Equal Rights Amendment has now become the symbol
of this devastating recognition. This largely accounts for the new wave
of intransigent opposition to it.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women, as represented in Houston, especially from the South,
white and black, also do not like Jews. They live in a Christian
country. A fragile but growing coalition between white and black women
in the New South is based on a shared Christian fundamentalism, which
translates into a shared anti-Semitism. The stubborn refusal of Jews to
embrace Christ and the barely masked fundamentalist perception of Jews
as Christ killers, communists and usurers both, queers, and, worst of
all, urban intellectuals, mark Jews as foreign, sinister, and an obvious
source of the many satanic conspiracies sweeping the nation.]{.font3}

[The most insidious expression of this rife anti-Semitism was conveyed
by a fixed stare, a self-conscious smile and the delightful words "Ah
just love tha Jewish people. " The slime variety of anti-Semite, very
much in evidence, was typified by a Right to Life leader who called
doctors who perform abortions "Jewish baby killers. " I was asked a
hundred times: "Am Ah speakin with a Jewish girl? " Despite my clear
presence as a lesbian-feminist with press credentials plastered all over
me from the notorious]{.font3} [Ms.]{.font3} [magazine, it was as a Jew
that I was consistently challenged and, on several occasions, implicitly
threatened. Conversation after conversation stopped abruptly when I
answered that yes, I was a Jew.]{.font3}

[\*]{.font4}

[The Right in the United States today is a social and political movement
controlled almost totally by men but built largely on the fear and
ignorance of women. The quality of this fear and the pervasiveness of
this ignorance are consequences of male sexual domination over women.
Every accommodation that women make to this domination, however
apparently stupid, self-defeating, or dangerous, is rooted in the urgent
need to survive somehow on male terms. Inevitably this causes women to
take the rage and contempt they feel for the men who actually abuse
them, those close to them, and project it onto others, those far away,
foreign, or different. Some women do this by becoming right-wing
patriots, nationalists determined to triumph over populations thousands
of miles removed. Some women become ardent racists, anti-Semites, or
homophobes. Some women develop a hatred of loose or destitute women,
pregnant teenage girls, all persons unemployed or on welfare. Some hate
individuals who violate social conventions, no matter how superficial
the violations. Some become antagonistic to ethnic groups other than
their own or to religious groups other than their own, or they develop a
hatred of those political convictions that contradict their own. Women
cling to irrational hatreds, focused particularly on the unfamiliar, so
that they will not murder their fathers, husbands, sons, brothers,
lovers, the men with whom they are intimate, those who do hurt them and
cause them grief. Fear of a greater evil and a need to be protected from
it intensify the loyalty of women to men who are, even when dangerous,
at least known quantities. Because women so displace their rage, they
are easily controlled and manipulated haters. Having good reason to
hate, but not the courage to rebel, women require symbols of danger that
justify their fear. The Right provides these symbols of danger by
designating clearly defined groups of outsiders as sources of danger.
The identities of the dangerous outsiders can change over time to meet
changing social circumstances---for example, racism can be encouraged or
contained; anti-Semitism can be provoked or kept dormant; homophobia can
be aggravated or kept under the surface---but the existence of the
dangerous outsider always functions for women simultaneously as
deception, diversion, pain-killer, and threat.]{.font3}

[The tragedy is that women so committed to survival cannot recognize
that they are committing suicide. The danger is that self-sacrificing
women are perfect foot soldiers who obey orders, no matter how criminal
those orders are. The hope is that these women, upset by internal
conflicts that cannot be stilled by manipulation, challenged by the
clarifying drama of public confrontation and dialogue, will be forced to
articulate the realities of their own experiences as women subject to
the will of men. In doing so, the anger that necessarily arises from a
true perception of how they have been debased may move them beyond the
fear that transfixes them to a meaningful rebellion against the men who
in fact diminish, despise, and terrorize them. This is the common
struggle of all women, whatever their male-defined ideological origins;
and this struggle alone has the power to transform women who are enemies
against one another into allies fighting for individual and collective
survival that is not based on self-loathing, fear, and humiliation, but
instead on self-determination, dignity, and authentic
integrity.]{.font3}

.sgc-1}

> [Why is life so tragic; so like a little strip of pavement over an
> abyss. I look down; I feel giddy; I wonder how I am ever to walk to
> the end\.... It's a feeling of impotence: of cutting no ice.]{.font3}

[Virginia Woolf, her diary,\
October 25, 1920]{.font3}

[Men hate intelligence in women. It cannot flame; it cannot burn; it
cannot burn out and end up in ashes, having been consumed in adventure.
It cannot be cold, rational, ice; no warm womb would tolerate a cold,
icy, splendid mind. It cannot be ebullient and it cannot be morbid; it
cannot be anything that does not end in reproduction or whoring. It
cannot be what intelligence is: a vitality of mind that acts directly in
and on the world, without mediation. "Indeed, " wrote Norman Mailer, "I
doubt if there will be a really exciting woman writer until the first
whore becomes a call girl and tells her tale. "^1^ And Mailer was being
generous, because he endowed the whore with a capacity to know, if not
to tell: she knows something firsthand, something worth knowing.
"Genius, " wrote Edith Wharton more realistically, "is of small use to a
woman who does not know how to do her hair. "^2^]{.font3}

[Intelligence is a form of energy, a force that pushes out into the
world. It makes its mark, not once but continuously. It is curious,
penetrating. Without the light of public life, discourse, and action, it
dies. It must have a field of action beyond embroidery or scrubbing
toilets or wearing fine clothes. It needs response, challenge,
consequences that matter. Intelligence cannot be passive and private
through a lifetime. Kept secret, kept inside, it withers and dies. The
outside can be brought to it; it can live on bread and water locked up
in a cell---but barely. Florence Nightingale, in her feminist
tract]{.font3} [Cassandra]{.font3}[, said that intellect died last in
women; desire, dreams, activity, and love all died before it.
Intelligence does hang on, because it can live on almost nothing:
fragments of the world brought to it by husbands or sons or strangers
or, in our time, television or the occasional film. Imprisoned,
intelligence turns into self-haunting and dread. Isolated, intelligence
becomes a burden and a curse. Undernourished, intelligence becomes like
the bloated belly of a starving child: swollen, filled with nothing the
body can use. It swells, like the starved stomach, as the skeleton
shrivels and the bones collapse; it will pick up anything to fill the
hunger, stick anything in, chew anything, swallow anything. "Jose Carlos
came home with a bag of crackers he found in the garbage, " wrote
Carolina Maria de Jesus, a woman of the Brazilian underclass, in her
diary. "When I saw him eating things out of the trash I thought: and if
it's been poisoned? Children can't stand hunger. The crackers were
delicious. I ate them thinking of that proverb: He who enters the dance
must dance. And as I also was hungry, I ate. "^3^ The intelligence of
women is traditionally starved, isolated, imprisoned.]{.font3}

[Traditionally and practically, the world is brought to women by men;
they are the outside on which female intelligence must feed. The food is
poor, orphan's gruel. This is because men bring home half-truths,
ego-laden lies, and use them to demand solace or sex or housekeeping.
The intelligence of women is not out in the world, acting on its own
behalf; it is kept small, inside the home, acting on behalf of another.
This is true even when the woman works outside the home, because she is
segregated into women's work, and ]{.font3}[her intelligence does not
have the same importance as the lay of her ass.]{.sgc-3}

[Men are the world and women use intelligence to survive men: their
tricks, desires, demands, moods, hatreds, disappointments, rages, greed,
lust, authority, power, weaknesses. The ideas that come to women come
through men, in a field of cultural values controlled by men, in a
political and social system controlled by men, in a sexual system in
which women are used as things. (As Catharine A. MacKinnon wrote in the
one sentence that every woman should risk her life to understand: "Man
fucks woman; subject verb object. "^4^) Men are the field of action in
which female intelligence moves. But the world, the real world, is more
than men, certainly more than what men show of themselves and the world
to women; and women are deprived of that real world. The male always
intervenes between her and it.]{.font3}

[Some will grant that women might have a particular kind of
intelligence---essentially small, picky, good with details, bad with
ideas. Some will grant---in fact, insist---that women know more of "the
Good, " that women are more cognizant of decency or kindness: this keeps
intelligence small and tamed. Some will grant that there have been women
of genius: after the woman of genius is dead. The greatest writers in
the English language have been women: George Eliot, Jane Austen,
Virginia Woolf. They were sublime; and they were, all of them, shadows
of what they might have been. But the fact that they existed does not
change the categorical perception that women are basically stupid: not
capable of intelligence without the exercise of which the world as a
whole is impoverished. Women are stupid and men are smart; men have a
right to the world and women do not. A lost man is a lost intelligence;
a lost woman is a lost (name the function) mother, housekeeper, sexual
thing. Classes of men have been lost, have been thrown away; there have
always been mourners and fighters who refused to accept the loss. There
is no mourning for the lost intelligence of women because there is no
conviction that such intelligence was real and was destroyed.
Intelligence is, in fact, seen as a function of masculinity, and women
are despised when they refuse to be lost.]{.font3}

[Women have stupid ideas that do not deserve to be called ideas. Marabel
Morgan writes an awful, silly, terrible book in which she claims that
women must exist for their husbands, do sex and be sex for their
husbands.\* D. H. Lawrence writes vile and stupid essays in which he
says the same thing basically with many references to the divine
phallus;\*\* but D. H. Lawrence is smart. Anita Bryant says that
cocksucking is a form of human cannibalism; she decries the loss of the
child who is the sperm.\*\*\* Norman Mailer believes that lost
ejaculations are lost sons and on that basis disparages male
homosexuality, masturbation, and contraception.\*\*\*\* But Anita Bryant
is stupid and Norman Mailer is smart. Is the difference in the style
with which these same ideas are delivered or in the penis? Mailer says
that a great writer writes with his balls; novelist Cynthia Ozick asks
Mailer in which color ink he dips his balls. Who is smart and who is
stupid?]{.font3}

[\* See The Total Woman or the quotations from it in chapter 1 of this
book. Or: "In the beginning, sex started in the garden. The first man
was all alone. The days were long, the nights were longer. He had no
cook, no nurse, no lover. God saw that man was lonely and in need of a
partner, so He gave him a woman, the best present any man could receive"
(The Total Woman, \[New York: Pocket Books, 1975\], p. 129).
"Spiritually, for sexual intercourse to be the ultimate satisfaction,
both partners need a personal relationship with their God. When this is
so their union is sacred and beautiful, and mysteriously the two blend
perfectly into one" (Total Woman, p. 128). ]{.font3}

[\*\* For instance: "Christianity brought marriage into the world:
marriage as we know it.. . . Man and wife, a king and queen with one or
two subjects, and a few square yards of territory of their own: this,
really, is marriage. It is true freedom because it is a true fulfillment
for man, woman, and children" (Sex, Literature, and Censorship \[New
York: The Viking Press, 1959\], p. 98). "It is the tragedy of modern
woman.. . . She is cocksure, but she is a hen all the time. Frightened
of her own henny self, she rushes to mad lengths about votes, or
welfare, or sports, or business: she is marvellous, out-manning the
man.. . . Suddenly it all falls out of relation to her basic henny self,
and she realises she has lost her life. The lovely henny surety, the
hensureness which is the real bliss of every female, has been denied
her: she never had it.. . . Nothingness! " (Sex, Literature, and
Censorship, pp. 4 9 - 5 0 ) . . . marriage is no marriage that is not
basically and permanently phallic, and that is not linked up with the
sun and the earth, the moon and the fixed stars and the planets, in the
rhythm of days, in the rhythm of months, in the rhythm of quarters, of
years, of decades, of centuries. Marriage is no marriage that is not a
correspondence of blood.. . . The phallus is a column of blood that
fills the valley of blood of a woman" (Sex, Literature, and Censorship,
p. 101). "Into the womb of the primary darkness enters the ray of
ultimate light, and time is begotten, conceived, there is the beginning

one flesh and the seed is fertilized---that's the sealing of life,
that's the beginning of life. To interfere with that in any
way---especially the eating of the forbidden fruit, the eating of the
sperm---that's why it's such an abomination.. . . it makes the sin of
homosexuality all the more hideous because it's antilife, degenerative"

[If an idea is stupid, presumably it is stupid whether the one who
articulates it is male or female. But that is not the case. Women,
undereducated as a class, do not have to read Aeschylus to know that a
man plants the sperm, the child, the son; women are the soil; she brings
forth the human he created; he is the originator, the father of life.
Women can have their own provincial, moralistic sources for this
knowledge: clergy, movies, gym teachers. The knowledge is common
knowledge: respected in the male writers because the male writers are
respected; stupid in women because women are stupid as a condition of
birth. Women articulate received knowledge and are laughed at for doing
so. But male writers with the same received ideas are acclaimed as new,
brilliant, interesting, even rebellious, brave, facing the world of sin
and sex forthrightly. Women have ignorant, moralistic prejudices; men
have ideas. To call this a double standard is to indulge in cruel
euphemism. This gender system of evaluating ideas is a sledgehammer that
bangs female intelligence to a pulp, annihilating it. Mailer and
Lawrence have taken on the world always; they knew they had a right to
it; their prose takes that right for granted; it is the gravitational
field in which they move. Marabel Morgan and Anita Bryant come to the
world as middle-aged women and try to act in it; of course they are
juvenile and imprecise in style, ridiculous even. Both Mailer and
Lawrence have written volumes that are as ridiculous, juvenile, despite
what they can take for granted as men, despite their sometimes mastery
of the language, despite their genuine accomplishments, despite the
beauty of a story or novel. But they are not called stupid even when
they are ridiculous. When the ideas of Lawrence cannot be distinguished
from the ideas of Morgan, either both are smart or both are stupid; and
similarly with Mailer and Bryant. Only the women, however, deserve and
get our contempt. Are Anita Bryant's ideas pernicious? Then so are
Norman Mailer's. Are Marabel Morgan's ideas side-slappingly funny? Then
so are D. H. Lawrence's.]{.font3}

[A woman must keep her intelligence small and timid to survive. Or she
must hide it altogether or hide it through style. Or she must go mad
like clockwork to pay for it. She will try to find the nice way to
exercise intelligence. But intelligence is not ladylike. Intelligence is
full of excesses. Rigorous intelligence abhors sentimentality, and women
must be sentimental to value the dreadful silliness of the men around
them. Morbid intelligence abhors the cheery sunlight of positive
thinking and eternal sweetness; and women must be sunlight and cheery
and sweet, or the woman could not bribe her way with smiles through a
day. Wild intelligence abhors any narrow world; and the world of women
must stay narrow, or the woman is an outlaw. No woman could be Nietzsche
or Rimbaud without ending up in a whorehouse or lobotomized. Any vital
intelligence has passionate questions, aggressive answers: but women
cannot be explorers; there can be no Lewis and Clark of the female mind.
Even restrained intelligence is restrained not because it is timid, as
women must be, but because it is cautiously weighing impressions and
facts that come to it from an outside that the timid dare not face. A
woman must please, and restrained intelligence does not seek to please;
it seeks to know through discernment. Intelligence is also ambitious: it
always wants more: not more being fucked, not more pregnancy; but more
of a bigger world. A woman cannot be ambitious in her own right without
also being damned.]{.font3}

[We take girls and send them to schools. It is good of us, because girls
are not supposed to know anything much, and in many other societies
girls are not sent to school or taught to read and write. In our
society, such a generous one to women, girls are taught some facts, but
not inquiry or the passion of knowing. Girls are taught in order to make
them compliant: intellectual adventurousness is drained, punished,
ridiculed out of girls. We use schools first to narrow the girl's scope,
her curiosity, then to teach her certain skills, necessary to the
abstract husband. Girls are taught to be passive in relation to facts.
Girls are not seen as the potential originators of ideas or the
potential searchers into the human condition. Good behavior is the
intellectual goal of a girl. A girl with intellectual drive is a girl
who has to be cut down to size. An intelligent girl is supposed to use
that intelligence to find a smarter husband. Simone de Beauvoir settled
on Sartre when she determined that he was smarter than she was. In a
film made when both were old, toward the end of his life, Sartre asks de
Beauvoir, the woman with whom he has shared an astonishing life of
intellectual action and accomplishment: how does it feel, to have been a
literary lady?]{.font3}

[Carolina Maria de Jesus wrote in her diary: "Everyone has an ideal in
life. Mine is to be able to read. "^5^ She is ambitious, but it is a
strange ambition for a woman. She wants learning. She wants the pleasure
of reading and writing. Men ask her to marry but she suspects that they
will interfere with her reading and writing. They will resent the time
she takes alone. They will resent the focus of her attention elsewhere.
They will resent her concentration and they will resent her
self-respect. They will resent her pride in herself and her pride in her
unmediated relationship to a larger world of ideas, descriptions, facts.
Her neighbors see her poring over books, or with pen and paper in hand,
amidst the garbage and hunger of the]{.font3} [favela.]{.font3} [Her
ideal makes her a pariah: her desire to read makes her more an outcast
than if she sat in the street putting fistfuls of nails into her mouth.
Where did she get her ideal? No one offered it to her. Two thirds of the
world's illiterates are women. To be fucked, to birth children, one need
not know how to read. Women are for sex and reproduction, not for
literature. But women have stories to tell. Women want to know. Women
have questions, ideas, arguments, answers. Women have dreams of being in
the world, not merely passing blood and heaving wet infants out of
laboring wombs. \"Women dream, " Florence Nightingale wrote in]{.font3}
[Cassandra]{.font3}[, "till they have no longer the strength to dream;
those dreams against which they so struggle, so honestly, vigorously,
and conscientiously, and so in vain, yet which are their life, without
which they could not have lived; those dreams go at last\.... Later in
life, they neither desire nor dream, neither of activity, nor of love,
nor of intellect. "^6^]{.font3}

[Virginia Woolf, the most splendid modern writer, told us over and over
how awful it was to be a woman of creative intelligence. She told us
when she loaded a large stone into her pocket and walked into the river;
and she told us each time a book was published and she went mad---don't
hurt me for what I have done, I will hurt myself first, I will be
incapacitated and I will suffer and I will be punished and then perhaps
you need not destroy me, perhaps you will pity me, there is such
contempt in pity and I am so proud, won't that be enough? She told us
over and over in her prose too: in her fiction she showed us, ever so
delicately so that we would not take offense; and in her essays she
piled on the charm, being polite to keep us polite. But she did write it
straight out too, though it was not published in her lifetime, and she
was right:]{.font3}

> [A certain attitude is required---what I call the pouring-out-tea

> chary feminine angle. My article, written from that oblique point of
> view, always went down. ^7^]{.font3}

[To value "the naked contact of a mind" is to have a virile
intelligence, one not shrouded in dresses and pretty gestures. Her work
did always go down, with the weight of what being female demanded. She
became a master of exquisite indirection. She hid her meanings and her
messages in a feminine style. She labored under that style and hid
behind that mask: and she was less than she could have been. She died
not only from what she did dare, but also from what she did not
dare.]{.font3}

[These three things are indissolubly linked: literacy, intellect, and
creative intelligence. They distinguish, as the cliche goes, man from
the animals. He who is denied these three is denied a fully human life
and has been robbed of a right to human dignity. Now change the gender.
Literacy, intellect, and creative intelligence distinguish woman from
the animals: no. Woman is not distinguishable from the animals because
she has been condemned by virtue of her sex class to a life of animal
functions: being fucked, reproducing. For her, the animal functions are
her meaning, her so-called humanity, as human as she gets, the highest
human capacities in her because she is female. To the orthodox of male
culture, she is animal, the antithesis of soul; to the liberals of male
culture, she is nature. In discussing the so-called biological origins
of male dominance, the boys can afford to compare themselves to baboons
and insects: they are writing books or teaching in universities when
they do it. A Harvard professor does not refuse tenure because a baboon
has never been granted it. The biology of power is a game boys play. It
is the male way of saying: she is more like the female baboon than she
is like me; she cannot be an eminence grise at Harvard because she
bleeds, we fuck her, she bears our young, we beat her up, we rape her;
she is an animal, her function is to breed. I want to see the baboon,
the ant, the wasp, the goose, the cichlid, that has written]{.font3}
[War and Peace.]{.font3} [Even more I want to see the animal or insect
or fish or fowl that has written]{.font3} [Middlemarch.]{.font3}

[Literacy is a tool, like fire. It is a more advanced tool than fire,
and it has done as much or more to change the complexion of the natural
and social worlds. Literacy, like fire, is a tool that must be used by
intelligence. Literacy is also a capacity: the capacity to be literate
is a human capacity; the capacity exists and it can be used or it can be
denied, refuted, made to atrophy. In persons socially despised, it is
denied. But denial is not enough, because people insist on meaning.
Humankind finds meaning in experiences, events, objects, communications,
relationships, feelings. Literacy functions as part of the search for
meaning; it helps to make that search possible. Men can deny that women
have the capacity to learn ancient Greek, but some women will learn it
nevertheless. Men can deny that poor women or working-class women or
prostituted women have the capacity to read or write their own language,
but some of those women will read or write their own language anyway;
they will risk everything to learn it. In the slaveholding South in the
United States, it was forbidden by law to teach slaves to read or write;
but some slaveowners taught, some slaves learned, some slaves taught
themselves, and some slaves taught other slaves. In Jewish law, it is
forbidden to teach women Talmud, but some women learned Talmud anyway.
People know that literacy brings dignity and a wider world. People are
strongly motivated to experience the world they live in through
language: spoken, sung, chanted, and written. One must punish people
terribly to stop them from wanting to know what reading and writing
bring, because people are curious and driven toward both experience and
the conceptualization of it. The denial of literacy to any class or
category of people is a denial of fundamental humanity. Humans viewed as
animal, not human, are classically denied literacy: slaves in
slave-owning societies; women in woman-owning societies; racially
degraded groups in racist societies. The male slave is treated as a
beast of burden; he cannot be allowed to read or write. The woman is
treated as a beast of breeding; she must not read or write. When women
as a class are denied the right to read and write, those who learn are
shamed by their knowledge: they are masculine, deviant; they have denied
their wombs, their cunts; in their literacy they repudiate the
definition of their kind.]{.font3}

[Certain classes of women have been granted some privileges of
literacy---not rights, privileges. The courtesans of ancient Greece were
educated when other women were kept ignorant, but they were not
philosophers, they were whores. Only by accepting their function as
whores could they exercise the privilege of literacy. Upper-class women
are traditionally taught some skills of literacy (distinctly more
circumscribed than the skills taught the males of their mating class):
they can exercise the privilege of literacy if they accept their
decorative function. After all, the man does not want the breeding,
bleeding bitch at the dinner table or the open cunt in the parlor while
he reads his newspaper or smokes his cigar. Language is refinement:
proof that he is human, not she.]{.font3}

[The increase in illiteracy among the urban poor in the United States is
consonant with a new rise in overt racism and contempt for the poor. The
illiteracy is programmed into the system: an intelligent child can go to
school and not be taught how to read or write. When the educational
system abandons reading and writing for particular subgroups, it
abandons human dignity for those groups: it becomes strictly custodial,
keeping the animals penned in; it does not bring human life to human
beings.]{.font3}

[Cross-culturally, girls and women are the illiterates, with two thirds
of the world's illiterates women and the rate rising steadily. Girls
need husbands, not books. Girls need houses or shacks to keep clean, or
street corners to stand on, not the wide world in which to roam. Refusal
to give the tool of literacy is refusal to give access to the world. If
she can make her own fire, read a book herself, write a letter or a
record of her thoughts or an essay or a story, it will be harder to get
her to tolerate the unwanted fuck, to bear the unwanted children, to see
him as life and life through him. She might get ideas. But even worse,
she might know the value of the ideas she gets. She must not know that
ideas have value, only that being fucked and reproducing are her
value.]{.font3}

[It has been hard, in the United States, to get women educated: there
are still many kinds of education off limits to women. In England, it
was hard for Virginia Woolf to use a university library. Simple literacy
is the first step, and, as Abby Kelley told a women's rights convention
in 1850, "Sisters, bloody feet have worn smooth the path by which you
came here. "^8^ Access to the whole language has been denied women; we
are only supposed to use the ladylike parts of it. Alice James noted in
her diary that "\[i\]t is an immense loss to have all robust and
sustaining expletives refined away from one! "^9^]{.font3}

[But it is in the actual exercise of literacy as a tool and as a
capacity that women face punishment, ostracization, exile,
recrimination, the most virulent contempt. To read and be feminine
simultaneously she reads Gothic romances, not medical textbooks;
cookbooks, not case law; mystery stories, not molecular biology. The
language of mathematics is not a feminine language. She may learn
astrology, not astronomy. She may teach grammar, not invent style or
originate ideas. She is permitted to write a little book about neurotic
women, fiction or nonfiction, if the little book is trite and
sentimental enough; she had better keep clear of philosophy altogether.
In fiction, she had better be careful not to overstep the severe limits
imposed by femininity. "This then, " wrote Virginia Woolf, "is another
incident, and quite a common incident in the career of a woman novelist.
She has to say I will wait. I will wait until men have become so
civilised that they are not shocked when a woman speaks the truth about
her body. The future of fiction depends very much upon what extent men
can be educated to stand free speech in women. "^10^ The constraint is
annihilation: language that must avoid one's own body is language that
has no place in the world. But speaking the truth about a woman's body
is not the simple explication of body parts---it is instead the place of
that particular body in this particular world, its value, its use, its
place in power, its political and economic life, its capacities both
potentially realized and habitually abused.]{.font3}

[In a sense intellect is the combination of literacy and intelligence:
literacy disciplines intelligence and intelligence expands the uses of
literacy; there is a body of knowledge that changes and increases and
also a skill in acquiring knowledge; there is a memory filled with
ideas, a storehouse of what has gone before in the world. Intellect is
mastery of ideas, of culture, of the products and processes of other
intellects. Intellect is the capacity to learn language disciplined into
learning. Intellect must be cultivated: even in men, even in the
smartest. Left alone in a private world of isolation, intellect does not
develop unless it has a private cultivator: a teacher, a father of
intellect, for instance. But the intellect in the female must not exceed
that of the teacher---or the female will be rebuked and denied. Walt
Whitman wrote that a student necessarily disowns and overthrows a
teacher; but the female student must always stay smaller than the
teacher, always meeker; her intelligence is never supposed to become
mastery. Intellect in a woman is always a sign of privilege: she has
been raised up above her kind, usually because of the beneficence of a
man who has seen fit to educate her. The insults to females of intellect
are legion: so-called bluestockings are a laughingstock; women of
intellect are ugly or they would not bother to have ideas; the pleasure
of cultivating the mind is sexual perversion in the female; the works of
literate men are strewn with vicious remarks against intellectual women.
Intellect in a woman is malignant. She is not ennobled by a fine mind;
she is deformed by it.]{.font3}

[The creative mind is intelligence in action in the world. The world
need not be defined as rivers, mountains, and plains. The world is
anywhere that thought has consequences. In the most abstract philosophy,
thought has consequences; philosophy is part of the world, sometimes its
own self-contained world. Thinking is action; so are writing, composing,
painting; creative intelligence can be used in the material world to
make products of itself. But there is more to creative intelligence than
what it produces. Creative intelligence is searching intelligence: it
demands to know the world, demands its right to consequence. It is not
contemplative: creative intelligence is too ambitious for that; it
almost always announces itself. It may commit itself to the pure search
for knowledge or truth, but almost always it wants recognition,
influence, or power; it is an accomplishing intelligence. It is not
satisfied by recognition of the personality that carries it; it wants
respect in its own right, respect for itself. Sometimes this respect can
be shown toward its product. Sometimes, when this intelligence exercises
itself in the more ephemeral realm of pure talk or mundane action,
respect for creative intelligence must be shown through respect for the
person manifesting it. Women are consistently and systematically denied
the respect creative intelligence requires to be sustained: painfully
denied it, cruelly denied it, sadistically denied it. Women are not
supposed to have creative intelligence, but when they do they are
supposed to renounce it. If they want the love of men, without which
they are not really women, they had better not hold on to an
intelligence that searches and that is action in the world; thought that
has consequences is inimical to fettered femininity. Creative
intelligence is not animal: being fucked and reproducing will not
satisfy it, ever; and creative intelligence is not decorative---it is
never merely ornamental as, for instance, upper-class women however well
educated must be. To stay a woman in the male-supremacist meaning of
that word, women must renounce creative intelligence: not just verbally
renounce it, though women do that all the time, but snuff it out in
themselves at worst, keep it timid and restrained at best. The price for
exercising creative intelligence for those born female is unspeakable
suffering. "All things on earth have their price, " wrote Olive
Schreiner, "and for truth we pay the dearest. We barter it for love and
sympathy. The road to honour is paved with thorns; but on the path to
truth, at every step you set your foot down on your heart. "^11^ Truth
is the goal of creative intelligence, whatever its kind and path;
tangling with the world is tangling with the problem of truth. One
confronts the muck of the world, but one's search is for the truth. The
particular truth or the ultimate character of the truth one finds is not
the issue. The intrusion of an intelligent, creative self into the world
to find the truth is the issue. There is nothing here for women, except
intimidation and contempt. In isolation, in private, a woman may have
pleasure from the exercise of creative intelligence, however restrained
she is in the exercise of it; but that intelligence will have to be
turned against herself because there is no further, complex, human world
in which it can be used and developed. Whatever of it leaks out will
entitle all and sundry to criticize her womanhood, which is the sole
identity available to her; her womanhood is deficient, because her
intelligence is virile.]{.font3}

["Why have women passion, intellect, moral activity\... " Florence
Nightingale asked in 1852, "and a place in society where no one of these
three can be exercised? "^12^ When she referred to moral activity, she
did not mean moralism; she meant moral intelligence. Moralism is the set
of rules learned by rote that keeps women locked in, so that
intelligence can never meet the world head on. Moralism is a defense
against experiencing the world. Moralism is the moral sphere designated
to women, who are supposed to learn the rules of their own proper,
circumscribed behavior by rote. Moral intelligence is active; it can
only be developed and refined by being used in the realm of real and
direct experience. Moral activity is the use of that intelligence, the
exercise of moral discernment. Moralism is passive: it accepts the
version of the world it has been taught and shudders at the threat of
direct experience. Moral intelligence is characterized by activity,
movement through ideas and history: it takes on the world and insists on
participating in the great and terrifying issues of right and wrong,
tenderness and cruelty. Moral intelligence constructs values; and
because those values are exercised in the real world, they have
consequences. There is no moral intelligence that does not have real
consequences in a real world, or that is simply and passively received,
or that can live in a vacuum in which there is no action. Moral
intelligence cannot be expressed only through love or only through sex
or only through domesticity or only through ornamentation or only
through obedience; moral intelligence cannot be expressed only through
being fucked or reproducing. Moral intelligence must act in a public
world, not a private, refined, rarefied relationship with one other
person to the exclusion of the rest of the world. Moral intelligence
demands a nearly endless exercise of the ability to make decisions:
significant decisions; decisions inside history, not peripheral to it;
decisions about the meaning of life; decisions that arise from an acute
awareness of one's own mortality; decisions on which one can honestly
and willfully stake one's life. Moral intelligence is not the stuff of
which cunts are made. Moralism is the cunt's effort to find some basis
for self-respect, a pitiful gesture toward being human at which men
laugh and for which women pity other women.]{.font3}

[There is also, possibly, sexual intelligence, a human capacity for
discerning, manifesting, and constructing sexual integrity. Sexual
intelligence could not be measured in numbers of orgasms, erections, or
partners; nor could it show itself by posing painted clitoral lips in
front of a camera; nor could one measure it by the number of children
born; nor would it manifest as addiction. Sexual intelligence, like any
other kind of intelligence, would be active and dynamic; it would need
the real world, the direct experience of it; it would pose not buttocks
but questions, answers, theories, ideas---in the form of desire or act
or art or articulation. It would be in the body, but it could never be
in an imprisoned, isolated body, a body denied access to the world. It
would not be mechanical; nor could it stand to be viewed as inert and
stupid; nor could it be exploited by another without diminishing in
vigor; and being sold on the marketplace as a commodity would
necessarily be anathema to it, a direct affront to its intrinsic need to
confront the world in self-defined and self-determining terms. Sexual
intelligence would probably be more like moral intelligence than like
anything else: a point that women for centuries have been trying to
make. But since no intelligence in a woman is respected, and since she
is condemned to moralism because she is defined as being incapable of
moral intelligence, and since she is defined as a sexual thing to be
used, the meaning of women in likening moral and sexual intelligence is
not understood. Sexual intelligence asserts itself through sexual
integrity, a dimension of values and action forbidden to women. Sexual
intelligence would have to be rooted first and foremost in the honest
possession of one's own body, and women exist to be possessed by others,
namely men. The possession of one's own body would have to be absolute
and entirely realized for the intelligence to thrive in the world of
action. Sexual intelligence, like moral intelligence, would have to
confront the great issues of cruelty and tenderness; but where moral
intelligence must tangle with questions of right and wrong, sexual
intelligence would have to tangle with questions of dominance and
submission. One preordained to be fucked has no need to exercise sexual
intelligence, no opportunity to exercise it, no argument that justifies
exercising it. To keep the woman sexually acquiescent, the capacity for
sexual intelligence must be prohibited to her; and it is. Her clitoris
is denied; her capacity for pleasure is distorted and defamed; her
erotic values are slandered and insulted; her desire to value her body
as her own is paralyzed and maimed. She is turned into an occasion for
male pleasure, an object of male desire, a thing to be used; and any
willful expression of her sexuality in the world unmediated by men or
male values is punished. She is used as a slut or as a lady; but sexual
intelligence cannot manifest in a human being whose predestined purpose
is to be exploited through sex, by sex, in sex, as sex. Sexual
intelligence constructs its own use: it begins with a whole body, not
one that has already been cut into parts and fetishized; it begins with
a self-respecting body, not one that is characterized by class as dirty,
wanton, and slavish; it acts in the world, a world it enters on its own,
with freedom as well as with passion. Sexual intelligence cannot live
behind locked doors, any more than any other kind of intelligence can.
Sexual intelligence cannot exist defensively, keeping out rape. Sexual
intelligence cannot be decorative or pretty or coy or timid, nor can it
live on a diet of contempt and abuse and hatred of its human form.
Sexual intelligence is not animal, it is human; it has values; it sets
limits that are meaningful to the whole person and personality, which
must live in history and in the world. Women have found the development
and exercise of sexual intelligence more difficult than any other kind:
women have learned to read; women have acquired intellect; women have
had so much creative intelligence that even despisal and isolation and
punishment have not been able to squeeze it out of them; women have
struggled for a moral intelligence that by its very existence repudiates
moralism; but sexual intelligence is cut off at its roots, because the
woman's body is not her own. The incestuous use of a girl murders it.
The sexual intimidation or violation of a girl murders it. The enforced
chastity of a girl murders it. The separation of girl from girl murders
it. The turning over of a girl to a man as wife murders it. The selling
of a girl into prostitution murders it. The use of a woman as a wife
murders it. The use of a woman as a sexual thing murders it. The selling
of a woman as a sexual commodity, not just on the street but in media,
murders it. The economic value given to a woman's body, whether high or
low, murders it. The keeping of a woman as a toy or ornament or
domesticated cunt murders it. The need to be a mother so that one is not
perceived as a whore murders it. The requirement that one bear babies
murders it. The fact that the sexuality of the female is predetermined
and that she is forced to be what men say she is murders sexual
intelligence: there is nothing for her to discern or to construct; there
is nothing for her to find out except what men will do to her and what
she will have to pay if she resists or gives in. She lives in a private
world---even a street corner is a private world of sexual usage, not a
public world of honest confrontation; and her private world of sexual
usage has narrow boundaries and a host of givens. No intelligence can
function in a world that consists fundamentally of two rules that by
their very nature prohibit the invention of values, identity, will,
desire: be fucked, reproduce. Men have constructed female sexuality and
in so doing have annihilated the chance for sexual intelligence in
women. Sexual intelligence cannot live in the shallow, predestined
sexuality men have counterfeited for women.]{.font3}

[Victoria Woodhull, 1874]{.font2 .sgc-1}

[The argument between wives and whores is an old one; each one thinking
that whatever she is, at least she is not the other. And there is no
doubt that the wife envies the whore---or Marabel Morgan's ladies would
not be wrapping themselves in Saran Wrap or wearing black boots with
lacy neon nighties---and that the whore envies the domesticity of the
wife---especially her physical sheltering and her relative sexual
privacy. Both categories of women--- specious as the categories finally
turn out to be---need what men have to give: they need the material
solicitude of men, not their cocks but their money. The cock is the
inevitable precondition; without it there is no man, no money, no
shelter, no protection. With it there may not be much, but women prefer
men to silence, exile, to being pariahs, to being lone refugees, to
being outcasts: defenseless. Victoria Woodhull---the first woman
stockbroker on Wall Street, the first woman to run for president of the
United States (1870), the publisher of the first translation of
the]{.font3} [Communist ]{.font3}[Manifesto]{.font3} [in the United
States (1871), the first person ever arrested under the notoriously
repressive Comstock Law (1872)\*---crusaded against the material
dependency of women on men because she knew that anyone who bartered her
body bartered her human dignity. She hated the hypocrisy of married
women; she hated the condition of prostitution, which degraded both
wives and whores; and especially she hated the men who profited sexually
and economically from marriage:]{.font3}

> [It's a sharp trick played by men upon women, by which they acquire
> the legal right to debauch them without cost, and to make it
> unnecessary for them to visit professional prostitutes, whose sexual
> services can only be obtained for money. Now, isn't this true? Men
> know it is. ^13^]{.font3}

[\* Woodhull wrote an expose of Henry Ward Beecher's adulterous affair
with Elizabeth Tilton, the wife of his best friend. Beecher was an
eminent minister. His hypocrisy was the main issue for Woodhull. The
expose was published by Woodhull in her own paper, Woodhull and
Clafin\'s Weekly. She was arrested, as was her sister and co-publisher,
Tennessee Clafin, for sending obscene literature through the mails. She
was imprisoned for four weeks without trial.]{.font3}

[Woodhull did not romanticize prostitution; she did not advocate it as
freedom from marriage or freedom in itself or sexual freedom.
Prostitution, she made clear, was for money, not for fun; it was
survival, not pleasure. Woodhull's passion was sexual freedom, and she
knew that the prostitution and rape of women were antithetical to it.
She was a mass organizer, and the masses of women were married, sexually
subordinated to men in marriage. At a time when feminists did not
analyze sex directly or articulate ideas explicitly antagonistic to sex
as practiced, Woodhull exposed marital rape and compulsory intercourse
as the purpose, meaning, and method of marriage:]{.font3}

[Of all the horrid brutalities of this age, I know of none so horrid as
those that are sanctioned and defended by marriage.]{.font3}

> [Night after night there are thousands of rapes committed, under cover
> of this accursed license; and millions---yes, I say it boldly, knowing
> whereof I speak---millions of poor, heartbroken, suffering wives are
> compelled to minister to the lechery of insatiable husbands, when
> every instinct of body and sentiment of soul revolts in loathing and
> disgust. All married persons know this is truth, although they may
> feign to shut their eyes and ears to the horrid thing, and pretend to
> believe it is not. The world has got to be startled from this pretense
> into realizing that there is nothing else now existing among
> pretendedly enlightened nations, except marriage, that invests men
> with the right to debauch women, sexually, against their wills. Yet
> marriage is held to be synonymous with morality! I say, eternal
> damnation sink such morality! ^14^]{.font3}

[Wives were the majority, whores the minority, prostitution the
condition of each, rape the underbelly of prostitution. Woodhull's
aggressive repudiation of the good woman/bad woman syndrome (with which
women, then as now, were so very comfortable), her relentless attacks on
the hypocrisy of the "good woman, " and her rude refusal to call the
sufferance of rape "virtue" had one purpose: to unite women in a common
perception of their common condition. Selling themselves was women's
desperate, necessary, unforgivable crime; not acknowledging the sale
divided women and obscured how and why women were used sexually by men;
marriage, women's only refuge, was the place of mass rape. Woodhull
proclaimed herself a "Free Lover, " by which she meant that she could
not be bought, not in marriage, not in prostitution as commonly
understood. In telling married women that they had indeed sold their sex
for money, she was telling them that they had bartered away more than
the prostitute ever could: all privacy, all economic independence, all
legal individuality, every shred of control over their bodies in sex and
in reproduction both.]{.font3}

[Woodhull herself was widely regarded as a whore because she proclaimed
herself sexually self-determining, sexually active; she spit in the face
of the sexual double standard. Called a prostitute by a man at a public
meeting, Woodhull responded: "A man questioning my virtue! Have I any
right as a woman to answer him? I hurl the intention back in your face,
sir, and stand boldly before you and this convention, and declare that I
never had sexual intercourse with any man of whom I am ashamed to stand
side by side before the world with the act. I am not ashamed of any act
of my life. At the time it was the best I knew. Nor am I ashamed of any
desire that has been gratified, nor of any passion alluded to. Every one
of them are a part of my own soul's life, for which, thank God, I am not
accountable to you. "^15^ Few feminists appreciated her (Elizabeth Cady
Stanton was an exception, as usual) because she confronted women with
her own sexual vitality, the political meaning of sex, the sexual and
economic appropriation of women's bodies by men, the usurpation of
female desire by men for the purposes of their own illegitimate power.
She was direct and impassioned and she made women remember: that they
had been raped. In focusing on the apparent and actual sexual worth of
wives and whores, she made the basic claim of radical feminism: all
freedom, including sexual freedom, begins with an absolute right to
one's own body---physical self-possession. She knew too, in practical as
well as political terms, that forced sex in marriage led to forced
pregnancy in marriage: "I protest against this form of slavery,
I]{.font3} [protest]{.font3} [against the custom which compels women to
give the control of their maternal functions over to anybody.
"^16^ ]{.font3}

[Victoria Woodhull exercised sexual intelligence in public discourse,
ideas, and activism. She is one of the few women to have done so. This
effort required all the other kinds of intelligence that distinguish
humans from animals: literacy, intellect, creative intelligence, moral
intelligence. Some consequences of sexual intelligence become clear in
Woodhull's exercise of it: she made the women she addressed in person
and in print face the sexual and economic system built on their bodies.
She was one of the great philosophers of and agitators for sexual
freedom---but not as men understand it, because she abhorred rape and
prostitution, knew them when she saw them inside marriage or outside it,
would not accept or condone the violence against women implicit in
them.]{.font3}

["I make the claim boldly, " she dared to say, "that from the very
moment woman is emancipated from the necessity of yielding the control
of her sexual organs to man to insure a home, food and clothing, the
doom of sexual demoralization will be sealed. "^17^ Since women
experienced sexual demoralization most abjectly in sexual intercourse,
Woodhull did not shy away from the inevitable conclusion: "From that
moment there will be no intercourse except such as is desired by women.
It will be a complete revolution in sexual matters\... "^18^ Intercourse
not willed and initiated by the woman was rape, in Woodhull's analysis.
She anticipated current feminist critiques of intercourse---modest and
rare as they are---by a century. As if to celebrate the centennial of
Woodhull's repudiation of male-supremacist sexual intercourse, Robin
Morgan in 1974 transformed Woodhull's insight into a firm principle:
"I]{.font3} [claim that rape exists any time sexual intercourse occurs
when it has not been initiated by the woman]{.font3}[,]{.font3} [out of
her own genuine affection and desire"^19^]{.font3} [This shocks,
bewilders---who can imagine it, what can it mean? Now as then, there is
one woman speaking, not a movement.\*]{.font3}

[\* In a recent essay, novelist Alice Walker wrote:.. I submit that any
sexual intercourse between a free man and a human being he owns or
controls is rape. " (See "Embracing the Dark and the Light, " Essence,
July 1982, p. 117. ) This definition has the advantage of articulating
the power that is the context for as well as the substance of the act.\
]{.font3}

[Woodhull was not taken seriously as a thinker, writer, publisher,
journalist, activist, pioneer, by those who followed her---not by the
historians, teachers, intellectuals, revolutionaries, reformers; not by
the lovers or rapists; not by the women. Had she been part of the
cultural dialogue on sexual issues, the whole subsequent development of
movements for sexual freedom would have been different in character:
because she hated rape and prostitution and understood them as
violations of sexual freedom, which male liberationists did not. But
then, this was why she was excluded: the men wanted the rape and
prostitution. She threatened not only those sacred institutions but the
male hallucinations that prettify those institutions: those happy
visions of happy women, caged, domesticated or wanton, numb to rape,
numb to being bought and sold. Her sexual intelligence was despised,
then ignored, because of what it revealed: he who hates the truth hates
the intelligence that brings it.]{.font3}

[Sexual intelligence in women, that rarest intelligence in a
male-supremacist world, is necessarily a revolutionary intelligence, the
opposite of the pornographic (which simply reiterates the world as it is
for women), the opposite of the will to be used, the opposite of
masochism and self-hatred, the opposite of "good woman" and "bad woman"
both. It is not in being a whore that a woman becomes an outlaw in this
man's world; it is in the possession of herself, the ownership and
effective control of her own body, her separateness and distinctness,
the integrity of her body as hers, not his. Prostitution may be against
the written law, but no prostitute has defied the prerogatives or power
of men as a class through prostitution. No prostitute provides any model
for freedom or action in a world of freedom that can be used with
intelligence and integrity by a woman; the model exists to entice
counterfeit female sexual revolutionaries, gullible liberated girls, and
to serve the men who enjoy them. The prostitute is no honest woman. She
manipulates as the wife manipulates. So too no honest woman can live in
marriage: no woman honest in her will to be free. Marriage delivers her
body to another to use: and there is no basis for self-respect in this
carnal arrangement, however sanctified it may be by church and
state.]{.font3}

[Wife or whore: she is defined by what men want; sexual intelligence is
stopped dead. Wife or whore: to paraphrase Thackeray, her heart is dead
("Her heart was dead long before her body. She had sold it to become Sir
Pitt Crawley's wife. Mothers and daughters are making the same bargain
every day in Vanity Fair"^20^). Wife or whore: both are fucked, bear
children, resent, suffer, grow numb, want more. Wife or whore: both are
denied a human life, forced to live a female one. Wife or whore:
intelligence denied, annihilated, ridiculed, obliterated, primes her to
surrender---to her female fate. Wife or whore: the two kinds of women
whom men recognize, whom men let live. Wife or whore: battered, raped,
prostituted; men desire her. Wife or whore: the whore comes in from the
cold to become the wife if she can; the wife thrown out into the cold
becomes the whore if she must. Is there a way out of the home that does
not lead, inevitably and horribly, to the street corner? This is the
question right-wing women face. This is the question all women face, but
right-wing women know it. And in the transit---home to street, street to
home---is there any place, reason, or chance for female intelligence
that is not simply looking for the best buyer?]{.font3}

of Woman; or Woman Affranchised, 1864]{.font2 .sgc-1}

[The sex labor of women for the most part is private---in the
bedroom---or secret---prostitutes may be seen, but how the johns use
them may not. Ideally women do nothing; women simply are women. In truth
women get used up in private or in secret being women. In the ideal
conception of womanhood, women do not do work that can be seen: women
only do hidden sex labor. In the real world, women who work for wages
outside of sex are dangerously outside the female sphere; and women are
denigrated for not being ideal---apparently idle, untouched by visible
labor.]{.font3}

[Behind the smoke screen of ideal idleness, there is always women's
work. Women's work, first, is marriage. "In the morning I'm always
nervous, " Carolina de Jesus wrote. "I'm afraid of not getting money to
buy food to eat\.... Senhor Manuel showed up saying he wanted to marry
me. But I don't want to\... a man isn't going to like a woman who can't
stop reading and gets out of bed to write and sleeps with paper and
pencil under her pillow. That's why I prefer to live alone, for my
ideals. "^21^]{.font3}

[The woman in marriage is often in marriage because her ideal is eating,
not writing.]{.font3}

[Women's work, second, is prostitution: sexual service outside of
marriage for money. "I'd like so much to have the illusion that I had
some freedom of choice, " said J. in Kate Millett's]{.font3} [The
Prostitution Papers.]{.font3} ["Maybe it's just an illusion, but I need
to think I had some freedom. Yet then I realize how much was determined
in the way I got into prostitution, how determined my life had been, how
fucked over I was\... So I believed I'd chosen it. What's most
terrifying is to look back, to realize what I went through and that I
endured it. "^22^]{.font3}

[The woman in prostitution learns, as Linda Lovelace said in]{.font3}
[Ordeal]{.font3}[, "to settle for the smallest imaginable triumphs, the
absence of pain or the momentary lessening of terror. "^23^ The woman in
prostitution is often in prostitution because her ideal is physical
survival---surviving the pimp, surviving poverty, having nowhere to
go.]{.font3}

[Women's social condition is built on a simple premise: women can be
fucked and bear babies, therefore women must be fucked and bear babies.
Sometimes, especially among the sophisticated, "penetrated" is
substituted for "fucked": women can be penetrated, therefore women must
be penetrated. This logic does not apply to men, whichever word is used:
men can be fucked, therefore men must be fucked; men can be penetrated,
therefore men must be penetrated. This logic applies only to women and
sex. One does not say, for instance, women have delicate hands,
therefore women must be surgeons. Or women have legs, therefore women
must run, jump, climb. Or women have minds, therefore women must use
them. One does learn, however, that women have sex organs that must be
used by men, or the women are not women: they are somehow less or more,
either of which is bad and thoroughly discouraged. Women are defined,
valued, judged, in one way only: as women---that is, with sex organs
that must be used. Other parts of the body do not signify, unless used
in sex or as an indicator of sexual availability or desirability.
Intelligence does not count. It has nothing to do with what a
woman]{.font3} [is.]{.font3}

[Women are born into the labor pool specific to women: the labor is sex.
Intelligence does not modify, reform, or revolutionize this basic fact
of life for women.]{.font3}

[Women are marked for marriage and prostitution by a wound between the
legs, acknowledged as such when men show their strange terror of women.
Intelligence neither creates nor destroys this wound; nor does it change
the uses of the wound, the woman, the sex.]{.font3}

[Women's work is done below the waist; intelligence is higher. Women are
lower; men are higher. It is a simple, dull scheme; but women's sex
organs in and of themselves are apparently appalling enough to justify
the scheme, make it self-evidently true.]{.font3}

[The natural intelligence of women, however expanded by what women
manage to learn despite their low status, manifests in surviving:
enduring, marking time, bearing pain, becoming numb, absorbing
loss---especially loss of self. Women survive men's use of
them---marriage, prostitution, rape; women's intelligence expresses
itself in finding ways to endure and find meaning in the unendurable, to
endure being used because of one's sex. "Sex with men, how can I say,
lacks the personal, "^24^ wrote Maryse Holder in]{.font3} [Give Sorrow
Words.]{.font3}

[Some women want to work: not sex labor; real work; work that men, those
real humans, do for a living wage. They want an honest wage for honest
work. One of the prostitutes Kate Millett interviewed made \$800 a week
in her prime. "With a Ph. D. and after ten years' experience in
teaching, " Millet wrote, "I was permitted to make only \$60 a week.
"^25^ ]{.font3}

[Women's work that is not marriage or prostitution is mostly segregated,
always underpaid, stagnant, sex-stereotyped. In the United States in
1981 women earned 56 to 59 percent of what men earned. Women are paid
significantly less than men for doing comparable work. It is not easy to
find comparable work. The consequences of this inequity---however the
percentages read in any given year, in any given country---are not new
for women. Unable to sell sex-neutral labor for a living wage, women
must sell sex. "To subordinate women in a social order in which she
must]{.font3} [work in order to live"]{.font3} [Jenny D'Hericourt wrote
French socialist Joseph Proudhon in the mid-1800s, "is to]{.font3}
[desire prostitution;]{.font3} [for disdain of the producer extends to
the value of the product;\... The woman who cannot live by working, can
only do so by prostituting herself; the equal of man or a courtesan,
such is the alternative. "^26^ Proudhon's egalitarian vision could not
be stretched to include women. He wrote D'Hericourt:]{.font3}

> [\... I do not admit that, whatever reparation may be due to woman, of
> joint thirds with her husband (or father) and her children, the most
> rigorous justice can ever make her the EQUAL of man;\... neither do I
> admit that this inferiority of the female sex constitutes for it
> either servitude, or humiliation, or a diminution of dignity, liberty,
> or happiness. I maintain that the contrary is true. ^27^]{.font3}

[D'Hericourt's argument constructs the world of women: women must work
for fair wages in nonsexual labor or they must sell themselves to men;
the disdain of men for women makes the work of women worth less simply
because women do it; the devaluation of women's work is predetermined by
the devaluation of women as a sex class; women end up having to sell
themselves because men will not buy labor from them that is not sex
labor at wages that will enable women to divest themselves of sex as a
form of labor.]{.font3}

[Proudhon's answer constructs the world of men: in the best of all
possible worlds---acknowledging that some economic discrimination
against women has taken place---no justice on earth can make women equal
to men because women are inferior to men: this inferiority does not
humiliate or degrade women; women find happiness, dignity, and liberty
in this inequality precisely because they are women---that is the nature
of women; women are being treated justly and are free when they are
treated as women---that is, as the natural inferiors of men.]{.font3}

[The brave new world Proudhon wanted was, for women, the same old world
women already knew.]{.font3}

[D'Hericourt recognized what Victoria Woodhull would not: "disdain of
the producer extends to the value of the product. " Work for wages
outside sex labor would not effectively free women from the stigma of
being female because the stigma precedes the woman and predetermines the
undervaluing of her work.]{.font3}

[This means that right-wing women are correct when they say that they
are worth more in the home than outside it. In the home their value is
recognized and in the workplace it is not. In marriage, sex labor is
rewarded: the woman is generally "given" more than she herself could
earn at a job. In the marketplace, women are exploited as cheap labor.
The argument that work outside the home makes women sexually and
economically independent of men is simply untrue. Women are paid too
little. And right-wing women know it.]{.font3}

[Feminists know that if women are paid equal wages for equal work, women
will gain sexual as well as economic independence. But feminists have
refused to face the fact that in a woman-hating social system, women
will never be paid equal wages. Men in all their institutions of power
are sustained by the sex labor and sexual subordination of women. The
sex labor of women must be maintained; and systematic low wages for
sex-neutral work effectively force women to sell sex to survive. The
economic system that pays women lower wages than it pays men actually
punishes women for working outside marriage or prostitution, since women
work hard for low wages and still must sell sex. The economic system
that punishes women for working outside the bedroom by paying low wages
contributes significantly to women's perception that the sexual serving
of men is a necessary part of any woman's life: or how else could she
live? Feminists appear to think that equal pay for equal work is a
simple reform, whereas it is no reform at all; it is revolution.
Feminists have refused to face the fact that equal pay for equal work is
impossible as long as men rule women, and right-wing women have refused
to forget it. Devaluation of women's labor outside the home pushes women
back into the home and encourages women to support a system in which, as
she sees it, he is paid for both of them---her share of his wage being
more than she could earn herself.]{.font3}

[In the workplace, sexual harassment fixes the low status of women
irreversibly. Women are sex; even filing or typing, women are sex. The
debilitating, insidious violence of sexual harassment is pervasive in
the workplace. It is part of nearly every working environment. Women
shuffle; women placate; women submit; women leave; the rare, brave women
fight and are tied up in the courts, often without jobs, for years.
There is also rape in the workplace.]{.font3}

[Where is the place for intelligence---for literacy, intellect,
creativity, moral discernment? Where in this world in which women live,
circumscribed by the uses to which men put women's sexual organs, is the
cultivation of skills, the cultivation of gifts, the cultivation of
dreams, the cultivation of ambition? Of what use is human intelligence
to a woman?]{.font3}

["Of course, " wrote Virginia Woolf, "the learned women were very ugly;
but then they were very poor. She would like to feed ]{.font3}[Chuffy
for a term on Lucy's rations and see what he said then about Henry the
Eighth. "^28^ ]{.sgc-3}

["No, it would not do the slightest good if he read my manuscript\..., "
wrote Ellen Glasgow in her memoir. "The best advice I can give you, ' he
said, with charming candor, 'is to stop writing, and go back to the
South and have some babies. ' And I think, though I may have heard this
ripe wisdom from other men, probably from many, that he added: The
greatest woman is not the woman who has written the finest book, but the
woman who has had the finest babies. ' That might be true. I did not
stay to dispute it. However, it was true also that I wanted to write
books, and not ever had I felt the faintest wish to have babies.
"^29^ ]{.sgc-3}

[Woodhull thought that freedom from sexual coercion would come with work
in the marketplace. She was wrong; the marketplace became, as men would
have it, another place for sexual intimidation, another arena of danger
to women burdened already with too many such arenas. Woolf put her faith
in education and art. She too was wrong. Men erase; misogyny distorts;
the intelligence of women is still both punished and despised.]{.sgc-3}

[Right-wing women have surveyed the world: they find it a dangerous
place. They see that work subjects them to more danger from more men; it
increases the risk of sexual exploitation. They see that creativity and
originality in their kind are ridiculed; they see women thrown out of
the circle of male civilization for having ideas, plans, visions,
ambitions. They see that traditional marriage means selling to one man,
not hundreds: the better deal. They see that the streets are cold, and
that the women on them are tired, sick, and bruised. They see that the
money they can earn will not make them independent of men and that they
will still have to play the sex games of their kind: at home and at work
too. They see no way to make their bodies authentically their own and to
survive in the world of men. They know too that the Left has nothing
better to offer: leftist men also want wives and whores; leftist men
value whores too much and wives too little. Right-wing women are not
wrong. They fear that the Left, in stressing impersonal sex and
promiscuity as values, will make them more vulnerable to male sexual
aggression, and that they will be despised for not liking it. They are
not wrong. Right-wing women see that within the system in which they
live they cannot make their bodies their own, but they can agree to
privatized male ownership: keep it one-on-one, as it were. They know
that they are valued for their sex--- their sex organs and their
reproductive capacity---and so they try to up their value: through
cooperation, manipulation, conformity; through displays of affection or
attempts at friendship; through submission and obedience; and especially
through the use of euphemism---"femininity, " "total woman, " "good, "
"maternal instinct, " "motherly love. " Their desperation is quiet; they
hide their bruises of body and heart; they dress carefully and have good
manners; they suffer, they love God, they follow the rules. They see
that intelligence displayed in a woman is a flaw, that intelligence
realized in a woman is a crime. They see the world they live in and they
are not wrong. They use sex and babies to stay valuable because they
need a home, food, clothing. They use the traditional intelligence of
the female---animal, not human: they do what they have to to
survive.]{.font3}

[Before the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the
United States, abortion was a crime. Some abortions were medically
licensed, but they were a minute percentage of the abortions actually
undergone by women. This meant that there were no records of the illegal
abortions performed (each abortion was a crime, each abortion was
clandestine), no medical histories or records, no statistics.
Information on illegal abortions came from these sources: (1) the
testimonies of women who had had such abortions and survived; (2) the
physical evidence of the botched abortions, evidence that showed up in
hospital emergency rooms all over the country every single
day---perforated uteruses, infections including gangrene, severe
hemorrhaging, incomplete abortions (in which fetal tissue is left in the
womb, always fatal if not removed); (3) the physical evidence of the
dead bodies (for instance, nearly one half ]{.font3}[of the maternal
deaths in New York State resulted from illegal abortions); (4) the
anecdotal reminiscences of doctors who were asked for "help" by
desperate women. These sources provide a profile of the average woman
who wanted and got an illegal abortion. Indisputably, she was married
and had children: "\... it has been repeatedly demonstrated that most
criminal abortions today are obtained by married women with children,
"^1^ wrote Jerome E. Bates and Edward S. Zawadzki in]{.font3} [Criminal
Abortion]{.font3}[, published in 1964. An estimated two thirds of the
women who got criminal abortions were married.\*\*  This means that up
to two thirds of the botched abortions were done on married women; up to
two thirds of the dead were married women; perhaps two thirds of the
survivors are married women. This means that most of the women who
risked death or maiming so as not to bear a child were married---perhaps
one million married women each year. They were not shameless sluts,
unless all women by definition are. They were not immoral in traditional
terms---though, even then, they were thought of as promiscuous and
single. Nevertheless, they were not women from the streets, but women
from homes; they were not daughters in the homes of fathers, but wives
in the homes of husbands. They were, quite simply, the good and
respectable women of Amerika. The absolute equation of abortion with
sexual promiscuity is a bizarre distortion of the real history of women
and abortion---too distorted to be acceptable even in the United States,
where historical memory ]{.font3}[reaches back one decade. Abortion has
been legalized just under one decade.\*\*\* The facts should not be
obliterated yet. Millions of respectable, God-fearing, married women
have had illegal abortions. They thank their God that they survived; and
they keep quiet.]{.sgc-6}

(based on the records of two abortionists in a single year, 1948;
arguably, the figure is low compared to other findings and estimates
because women lied about marital status when committing the criminal act
of getting an abortion) to 7 5 percent (the sample being composed of
women in charity hospitals from botched abortions). Bates and Zawadzki,
who discuss both the 49. 6 percent figure and the 75 percent figure,
conclude that they "could find no authority or piece of research
purporting to demonstrate that the majority of women undergoing abortion
today are unmarried"]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14} [(Criminal Abortion]{.font2

[\*\*\* As this book is published, abortion has been legalized not quite
one decade, but never without restrictions permitted by the Supreme
Court and imposed by state legislatures and often with unconstitutional
restrictions imposed by state or local governments until overturned by
federal courts (paternal and parental consent requirements, for
instance).\

[Their reasons for keeping quiet are women's reasons. Because they are
women, their sexuality or even perceptions of it can discredit or hurt
or destroy them---inexplicably shame them; provoke rage, rape, and
ridicule in men. Dissociation from other women is always the safest
course. They are not sluttish, but other women who have had abortions
probably are. They tried not to get pregnant (birth control being
illegal in many parts of the country before 1973), but other women who
had abortions probably did not. They love their children, but other
women who have had abortions may well be the cold mothers, the cruel
mothers, the vicious women. They are individuals of worth and good
morals who had compelling reasons for aborting, but the other women who
had abortions must have done something wrong, were wrong, are somehow
indistinct (not emerged from the primal female slime as individuals),
were sex not persons. In keeping the secret they cut themselves off from
other women to escape the shame of other women, the shame of being the
same as other women, the shame of being female. They are ashamed of
having had this bloody experience, of having this female body that gets
torn into again and again and bleeds and can die from the tearing and
the bleeding, the pain and the mess, of having this body that was
violated again, this time by abortion. Admitting to an illegal abortion
is like admitting to having been raped: whoever you tell can see you,
undress you, spread your legs, see the thing go in, see the blood, watch
the pain, almost touch the fear, almost taste the desperation. The woman
who admits to having had an illegal abortion allows whoever hears her to
picture her---her as an individual in that wretched body---in unbearable
vulnerability, as close to being punished purely for being female as
anyone ever comes. It is the picture of a woman being tortured for
having had sex.]{.font3}

[There is the fear of having murdered: not someone, not real murder; but
of having done something hauntingly wrong. She has learned]{.font3}
[(learned]{.font3} [is a poor word for what has happened to her) that
every life is more valuable than her own; her life gets value through
motherhood, a kind of benign contamination. She has been having children
in her mind, and getting her value through them, since she herself was a
baby. Little girls believe that dolls are real babies. Little girls put
dolls to sleep, feed them, bathe them, diaper them, nurse them through
illnesses, teach them how to walk and how to talk and how to
dress---love them. Abortion turns a woman into a murderer all right: she
kills that child pregnant in her since her own childhood; she kills her
allegiance to Motherhood First. This is a crime. She is guilty: of not
wanting a baby.]{.font3}

[There is the fear of having murdered because so many men believe so
passionately that she has. To many men, each aborted pregnancy is the
killing of a son---and he is the son killed. His mother would have
killed him if she had had the choice. These men have a peculiarly
retroactive and abstract sense of murder: if she had had a
choice,]{.font3} [I]{.font3} [would not have been born---which is
murder. The male ego, which refuses to believe in its own death, now
pushes backward, before birth. I was once a fertilized egg; therefore to
abort a fertilized egg is to kill]{.font3} [me.]{.font3} [Women keep
abortions secret because they are afraid of the hysteria of men
confronted with what they regard as the specter of their own extinction.
If you had your way, men say to feminists, my mother would have
aborted]{.font3} [me.]{.font3} [Killed]{.font3} [me.]{.font3} ["\... I
was born out of wedlock (and against the advice that my mother received
from her doctor), " Jesse Jackson writes in fervent opposition to
abortion, "and therefore abortion is a personal issue for me. "^2^ The
woman's responsibility to the fertilized egg is imaginatively and with
great conviction construed to be her relation to the adult male. At the
very least, she must not murder him; nor should she outrage his
existence by an assertion of her separateness from him, her
distinctness, her importance as a person independent of him. The adult
male's identification with the fertilized egg as being fully himself can
even be conceptualized in terms of power: his rightful power over an
impersonal female (all females being the same in terms of function).
"The]{.font3} [power]{.font3} [I had as]{.font3} [one]{.font3} [cell to
affect my environment I shall never have again, "^3^ R. D. Laing laments
in an androcentric meditation on prebirth ego. "My environment" is a
woman; the adult male, even as a fertilized egg, one cell, has the right
of occupation with respect to her---he has the right to be inside her
and the rightful power to change her body for his sake. This relation to
gestation is specifically male. Women do not think of themselves in
utero when they think either of being pregnant or of aborting; men think
of pregnancy and abortion primarily in terms of themselves, including
what happened or might have happened to them back in the womb when, as
one cell, they were themselves.]{.font3}

[Women keep quiet about abortions they have had, illegal abortions,
because they are humiliated by the memory of those abortions; they are
humiliated by the memory of their desperation, the panic, finding the
money, finding the abortionist, the dirt, the danger, the secrecy. Women
are humiliated when they remember asking for help, begging for help,
when they remember those who turned away, left them out in the cold.
Women are humiliated by the memory of the fear. Women are humiliated by
the memory of the physical intrusion, the penetration, the pain, the
violation; countless women were sexually assaulted by the abortionist
before or after the abortion; they hate remembering. Women are
humiliated because they hated themselves, their sex, their female
bodies, they hated being female. Women hate remembering illegal
abortions because they almost died, they could have died, they wanted to
die, they hoped they would not die, they made promises to God begging
him not to let them die, they were afraid of dying before and during and
after; they have never again been so afraid of death or so alone; they
had never before been so afraid of death or so alone. And women hate
remembering illegal abortions because their husbands experienced none of
this: which no woman forgives.]{.font3}

[Women also keep quiet about illegal abortions precisely because they
had married sex: their husbands mounted them, fucked them, impregnated
them; their husbands determined the time and the place and the act;
desire, pleasure, or orgasm were not necessarily experienced by the
women, yet the women ended up on the butcher's block. The abortionist
finished the job the husband had started. No one wants to remember
this.]{.font3}

[Women also keep quiet about abortions they have had because they wanted
the child, but the man did not; because they wanted other children and
could not have them; because they never regretted the abortion and did
regret subsequent children; because they had more than one abortion,
which, like more than one rape, fixes the woman's guilt. Women keep
quiet about abortions because abortion inside marriage is selfish,
ruthless, marks the woman as heartless, loveless---yet she did it
anyway. Women also keep quiet about abortions they have had, illegal
abortions, because the woman who has had one, or tried to induce one in
herself, is never really trusted again: if she will do that to
herself---hurt herself, tear up her own insides rather than have a
child---she must be the frenzied female, the female gone mad, the
lunatic female, the female in rebellion against her own body and
therefore against man and God, the female who is most feared and
abhorred, the Medea underneath the devoted wife and mother, the wild
woman, the woman enraged with the sorrow between her legs, the woman
grief-stricken by the way men use her uterus, the woman who has finally
refused to be forced and so she must be punished by the pain and the
blood, the tearing and the terror.]{.font3}

[The law gives a married woman to her husband to be fucked at will, his
will; the law forced the woman to bear any child that might result.
Illegal abortion was a desperate, dangerous, last-ditch, secret, awful
way of saying no. It is no wonder that so many respectable, married,
God-fearing women hate abortion.]{.font3}

[Women cannot be responsible for pregnancy, in the sense of acting to
prevent it, because women do not control when, where, how, and on what
terms they have intercourse. Intercourse is forced on women, both as a
normal part of marriage and as the primary sex act in virtually any
sexual encounter with a man. No woman needs intercourse; few women
escape it.]{.font3}

[In marriage a man has the sexual right to his wife: he can fuck her at
will by right of law. The law articulates and defends this right. The
state articulates and defends this right. This means that the state
defines the intimate uses of a woman's body in marriage; so that a man
acts with the protection of the state when he fucks his wife, regardless
of the degree of force surrounding or intrinsic to the act. In the
United States only five states have entirely abrogated the so-called
marital rape exemption---the legal proviso that a man cannot be
criminally charged for raping his wife because rape by definition cannot
exist in the context of marriage, since marriage licenses the use of a
woman's body by her husband against her will. Nearly three times that
many states have]{.font3} [extended]{.font3} [the husband's right to
forced intercourse to cohabiting men or, in some cases, even to
so-called voluntary social companions. But even where marital rape is
illegal, the husband has at his disposal the ordinary means of sexual
coercion, including threat of physical violence, punitive economic
measures, sexual or verbal humiliation in private or in public, violence
against inanimate objects, and threats against children. In other words,
eliminating the legal sanctioning of rape does not in itself eliminate
sexual coercion in marriage; but the continued legal sanctioning of rape
underlines the coercive character and purpose of marriage. Marriage law
is irrefutable proof that women are not equal to men. No person can
enter into an agreement in which her body is given to another and remain
or become or act as or effectually be his equal.]{.font3}

[The law takes the form it does with divine sanction: civil law
reiterates religious dogma. The law enforces a relationship between men
and women that has its origins in so-called divine law; the law enforces
the divinely ordained subordination of women through its regulation of
sex in marriage. The law is an instrument of religion, and it is
precisely as an instrument of religion that law regulating marriage gets
its special character: laws against assault and battery pale in
importance when compared with the divine law giving a man authority over
his wife's body. The man's authority over his wife's body is willed by
God---even if the same relationship outside of marriage and without
reference to gender would be described as slavery or torture. The laws
of God are upheld by the laws of this republic, this proud secular
democracy. The marriage laws fundamentally violate the civil rights of
women as a class by forcing all married women to conform to a religious
view of women's sexual function. These same laws violate the civil
rights of women by compelling women to serve their husbands sexually
whether they will it or not and by defining women as a class
in ]{.font3}[terms of a sexual function that must be fulfilled.
\*]{.sgc-6}

[\* ]{.sgc-6}[The American Civil Liberties Union has a handbook on
women's rights. In that handbook, laws against prostitution are
discussed in terms of the right of women to have sex: "the central focus
of all these laws is to punish]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14} [sexual
activity]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14}["]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14} [(The Rights
of Women]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14}[, Susan C. Ross \[New York: Avon,
1973\], p. 176); equal right to sexual activity is seen to be the civil
liberties issue of paramount importance and laws against prostitution
are simply a cover for denying women the right to sexual activity. This
is not a narrow discussion of laws on prostitution and their
sex-discriminatory language or enforcement. It is a position on what
rights are for women, what freedom is. There is no mention of marital
rape or of the marital rape exemption as violations of civil liberties
and no discussion whatsoever of sexual coercion in marriage sanctioned
by law in letter and in practice as a violation of civil liberties. The
discussion of rape also makes no reference to marital rape or the role
of law in upholding it.]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-14}

[Women feel the pressure to submit in a myriad of ways, none of which
have to do with marital law as such. The woman is likely to encounter
marital law when she has been abused and seeks to act in her own behalf
as if she had a right to the disposition of her own body. The point is
that the law sets the standard for the disposition of her body: it
belongs to her husband, not to her.]{.font3}

[The good wife submits; the bad wife can be forced to submit. All women
are supposed to submit.]{.font3}

[One of the consequences of submission, whether conforming or forced, is
pregnancy.]{.font3}

[Women are required to submit to intercourse, and women may then be
required to submit to the pregnancy.]{.font3}

[Women are required to submit to the man, and women may then be required
to submit to the fetus.]{.font3}

[Since the law sets the standard for the control, use of, function of,
purpose of, the wife's body, and since the law supports the right of the
man to use force against his wife in order to have sex, women live in a
context of forced sex. This is true outside the realm of subjective
interpretation. If it were not true, the law would not be formulated to
sanction the husband's forced penetration of his wife. Marriage is the
common state of adult women; women live in a system in which sex is
forced on them; and the sex is intercourse. Women, it is said, have a
bad attitude toward sex. Women, it is not said often enough, have a
long-lived resentment against forced sex and a longing for freedom,
which is often expressed as an aversion to sex. It is a fact for women
that they must come to terms with forced sex over and over in the course
of a normal life.]{.font3}

[Forced sex, usually intercourse, is a central issue in any woman's
life. She must like it or control it or manipulate it or resist it or
avoid it; she must develop a relationship to it, to the male insistence
on intercourse, to the male insistence on her sexual function in
relation to him. She will be measured and judged by the nature and
quality of her relationship to intercourse. Her character will be
assessed in terms of her relationship to intercourse, as men evaluate
that relationship. All the possibilities of her body will be reduced to
expressing her relationship to intercourse. Every sign on her body,
every symbol---clothes, posture, hair, ornament---will have to signal
her acceptance of his sex act and the nature of her relationship to it.
His sex art, intercourse, explicitly announces his power over her: his
possession of her interior; his right to violate her boundaries. His
state promotes and protects his sex act. If she were not a woman, this
intrusion by the state would be recognized as state coercion, or force.
The act itself and the state that protects it call on force to exercise
illegitimate power; and intercourse cannot be analyzed outside this
system of force. But the force is hidden and denied by a barrage of
propaganda, from pornography to so-called women's magazines, that seek
to persuade that accommodation is pleasure, or that accommodation is
femininity, or that accommodation is freedom, or that accommodation is a
strategic means to some degree of self-determination.]{.font3}

[The propaganda for femininity (femininity being the apparent acceptance
of sex on male terms with goodwill and demonstrable good faith, in the
form of ritualized obsequiousness) is produced ]{.font3}[according to
the felt need of men to have intercourse. In a time of feminist
resistance, such propaganda increases in bulk geometrically. The
propaganda stresses that intercourse can give a woman pleasure if she
does it right: especially if she has the right attitude toward it and
toward the man. The right attitude is to want it. The right attitude is
to desire men]{.font3} [because]{.font3} [they engage in phallic
penetration. The right attitude is to want intercourse because men want
it. The right attitude is not to be selfish: especially about orgasm.
This prohibits a sexuality for women outside the boundaries of male
dominance. This makes any woman-centered sexuality impossible. What it
does make possible is a woman's continued existence within a system in
which men control the valuation of her existence as an individual. This
valuation is based on her sexual conformity within a sexual system based
on his right to possess her. Women are brought up to conform: all the
rules of femininity---dress, behavior, attitude---essentially break the
spirit. Women are trained to need men, not sexually but metaphysically.
Women are brought up to be the void that needs filling, the absence that
needs presence. Women are brought up to fear men and to know that they
must please men and to understand that they cannot survive without the
help of men richer and stronger than they can be themselves, on their
own. Women are brought up to submit to intercourse---and here the
strategy is shrewd---by being kept ignorant of it. The rules are taught,
but the act is hidden. Girls are taught "love, " not "fuck. " Little
girls look between their legs to see if "the hole" is there, get scared
thinking about what "the hole" is for; no one tells them either. Women
use their bodies to attract men; and most women, like the little girls
they were, are astonished by the brutality of the fuck. The importance
of this ignorance about intercourse cannot be overstated: it is as if no
girl would grow up, or accept the hundred million lessons on how to be a
girl, or want boys to like her, if she knew what she was for. The
propaganda for femininity assumes that the girl still lives inside the
woman; that the lessons of femininity must be taught and retaught
without letup; that the woman left to herself would repudiate the male
use of her body, simply not accept it. The propaganda for femininity
teaches women over and over, endlessly, that they must like intercourse;
and the lesson must be taught over and over, endlessly, because
intercourse does not express their own sexuality in general and the male
use of women rarely has anything to do with the woman as an individual.
The sexuality they are supposed to like does not recognize, let alone
honor, their individuality in any meaningful way. The sexuality they
must learn to like is not concerned with desire toward them as distinct
personalities---at best they are "types"; nor is it concerned with their
own desire toward others.]{.font3}

[Despite the propaganda, the mountains of it, intercourse requires
force; force is still essential to make women have intercourse---at
least in a systematic, sustained way. Despite every single platitude
about love, women and men, passion, femininity, intercourse as health or
pleasure or biological necessity, it is forced sex that keeps
intercourse central and it is forced sex that keeps women in sexual
relation to men. If the force were not essential, the force would not be
endemic. If the force were not essential, the law would not sanction it.
If the force were not essential, the force itself would not be defined
as intrinsically "sexy, " as if in practicing force sex itself is
perpetuated.]{.font3}

[The first kind of force is physical violence: endemic in rape, battery,
assault.]{.font3}

[The second kind of force is the power differential between male and
female that intrinsically makes any sex act an act of force: for
instance, the sexual abuse of girls in families.]{.font3}

[The third kind of force is economic: keeping women poor to keep women
sexually accessible and sexually compliant.]{.font3}

[The fourth kind of force is cultural on a broad scale: woman-hating
propaganda that makes women legitimate and desirable sexual targets;
woman-hating laws that either sanction or in their actual application
permit sexual abuse of women; woman-hating practices of verbal
harassment backed by the threat of physical violence on the streets or
in the workplace; woman-hating textbooks used to teach doctors, lawyers,
and other professionals misogyny as a central element of the practice of
their profession; woman-hating art that romanticizes sexual assault,
stylizes and celebrates sexual violence; woman-hating entertainment that
makes women as a class ridiculous, stupid, despicable, and the sexual
property of all men.]{.font3}

[Because women are exploited as a sex class for sex, it is impossible to
talk about women's sexuality outside the context of forced sex or, at
the least, without reference to forced sex; and yet, to keep forced sex
going and invisible simultaneously, it is discussed every other way, all
the time.]{.font3}

[The force itself is intrinsically "sexy, " romanticized, described as a
measure of the desire of an individual man for an individual woman.
Force, duress, subterfuge, threat---all add "sex" to the sex act by
intensifying the femininity of the woman, her status as a creature of
forced sex.]{.font3}

[It is through intercourse in particular that men express and maintain
their power and dominance over women. The right of men to women's bodies
for the purpose of intercourse remains the heart, soul, and balls of
male supremacy: this is true whatever style of advocacy is used, Right
or Left, to justify coital access.]{.font3}

[Every woman---no matter what her sexual orientation, personal sexual
likes or dislikes, personal history, political ideology---lives inside
this system of forced sex. This is true even if she has never personally
experienced any sexual coercion, or if she personally likes intercourse
as a form of intimacy, or if she as an individual has experiences of
intercourse that transcend, in her opinion, the dicta of gender and the
institutions of force. This is true even if--- for her---the force is
eroticized, essential, central, sacred, meaningful, sublime. This is
true even if---for her---she repudiates intercourse and forbids it: if
she subjectively lives outside the laws of gravity, obviously the laws
of gravity will intrude. Every woman is surrounded by this system of
forced sex and is encapsulated by it. It acts on her, shapes her,
defines her boundaries and her possibilities, tames her, domesticates
her, determines the quality and nature of her privacy: it modifies her.
She functions within it and with constant reference to it. This same
system that she is inside is inside her---metaphorically and literally
delivered into her by intercourse, especially forced intercourse,
especially deep thrusting. Intercourse violates the boundaries of her
body, which is why intercourse is so often referred to as violation.
Intercourse as a sex act does not correlate with anything but male
power: its frequency and centrality have nothing to do with
reproduction, which does not require that intercourse be the central
sexual act either in society at large or in any given sexual
relationship or encounter; its frequency and centrality have nothing to
do with sexual pleasure for the female or the male, in that pleasure
does not prohibit intercourse but neither does pleasure demand it.
Intercourse is synonymous with sex because intercourse is the most
systematic expression of male power over women's bodies, both concrete
and emblematic, and as such it is upheld as a male right by law (divine
and secular), custom, practice, culture, and force. Because intercourse
so consistently expresses illegitimate power, unjust power, wrongful
power, it is intrinsically an expression of the female's subordinate
status, sometimes a celebration of that status. The shame that women
feel on being fucked and simultaneously experiencing pleasure in being
possessed is the shame of having acknowledged, physically and
emotionally, the extent to which one has internalized and eroticized the
subordination. It is a shame that has in it the kernel of resistance.
The woman who says no to her husband, whatever her reasons, also says no
to the state, no to God, no to the power of men over her, that power
being both personal and institutional. Intercourse is forced on the
woman by a man, his state, his God, and through intercourse an
individual is made into a woman: a woman is made. Whether a woman likes
or does not like, desires or does not desire, to be made a woman does
not change the meaning of the act. "There are many scarcely nubile
girls, " wrote Colette, "who dream of becoming the show, the plaything,
the licentious masterpiece of some middle-aged man. It is an ugly dream
that is punished by its fulfillment, a morbid thing, akin to the
neuroses of puberty, the habit of eating chalk and coal, of drinking
mouthwash, of reading dirty books and sticking pins into the palm of the
hand. "^4^ Forced intercourse in marriage---that is, the right to
intercourse supported by the state in behalf of the husband---provides
the context for both rape as commonly understood and incestuous rape.
Marital sex and rape are opposite and opposing forms of sexual
expression only when women are viewed as sexual property: when rape is
seen as the theft of one man's property by another man. As soon as the
woman as a human being becomes the central figure in a rape, that is, as
soon as she is recognized as a human victim of an inhumane act, forced
sex must be recognized as such, whatever the relation of the man to his
victim. But if forced sex is sanctioned and protected in marriage, and
indeed provides an empirical definition of what women are for, how then
does one distinguish so-called consensual, normal sex (intercourse) from
rape? There is no context that is both normal and protected in which the
will of the woman is recognized as the essential precondition for sex.
It has been the business of the state to regulate male use of sexual
force against women, not to prohibit it. The state may allow a man to
force his wife but not his daughter, or his wife but not his neighbor's
wife. Rather than prohibiting the use of force against women per se, a
male-supremacist state establishes a relationship between sexual force
and normalcy: in marriage, a woman has no right to refuse her husband
intercourse. Limits to the force men can use have been negotiated by men
with one another in their own interests---and are renegotiated in every
rape or incest case in which the man is held blameless because force is
seen as intrinsically and properly sexual (that is, normal) when used to
effect female sexual compliance. The society's opposition to rape is
fake because the society's commitment to forced sex is real: marriage
defines the normal uses to which women should be put, and marriage
institutionalizes forced intercourse. Consent then logically becomes
mere passive acquiescence; and passive compliance does become the
standard of female participation in intercourse. Because passive
acquiescence is the standard in normal intercourse, it becomes proof of
consent in rape. Because force is sanctioned to effect intercourse in
marriage, it becomes common sexual practice, so that its use in sex does
not signify, prove, or even---especially to men---suggest
rape. ]{.font3}

[Forced intercourse in marriage, being both normal and state-sanctioned,
provides the basis for the wider practice of forced sex, tacitly
accepted most of the time. Forced intercourse in marriage as the norm
sanctioned by the state makes it virtually impossible to identify (male)
force or (female) consent; to say what they are so as to be able to
recognize them in discrete instances. The state can and does make
distinctions by category---for instance, sex with little girls is off
limits---but no finer kind of distinction can be made because that would
require a repudiation of force as a part of normal sex. Since the nearly
universal acceptance of forced intercourse in marriage is a kind of
universal callousness---an agreement as to the disposition of married
women's bodies, thereby annihilating any conception of their civil or
sexual rights or any sensitivity to force in sex as a violation of those
women's rights---it is easy to extend the callous acceptance of men's
civilly guaranteed right to use force to get sex to broader categories
of women, also to girls, and this has happened. There is the belief that
men use force because they are men. There is the belief that women like
force and respond to it sexually. There is the belief that force is
intrinsically sexy. There is the conceit that the married woman is the
most protected of all women: if force is right with her, with whom can
it be wrong? if a man does to another woman what he does to his wife, it
may be adultery but how can it be rape when in fact it is simply---from
his point of view---plain old sex? There is the definition of when a
girl becomes a woman: a girl may be considered adult because she has
menstruated (at the age of ten, for instance) or because she has a
so-called provocative quality, which means that a man wants to fuck her
and that therefore she is presumed to be a woman and to have adult
knowledge of what sex is and what a woman is. There is the definition of
the female in terms of her function, which is to be fucked; so it may be
unfortunate that she is fucked too early, but once fucked she has
fulfilled a preordained function as a woman and therefore is a woman and
therefore can legitimately be fucked.]{.font3}

[With respect to pregnancy, if a woman can be forced to bear a child
conceived by force in marriage, there is no logic in differentiating
pregnancy as a result of rape or incestuous rape. Force is the norm;
pregnancy is the result; the woman has no claim to a respected identity
not predicated on forced intercourse---that is, at best her dignity
inheres in being a wife, subject to forced intercourse and therefore to
forced pregnancy; why would any woman's body be entitled to more respect
than the married woman's? Rape, rarely credited as such by men unless
the display of force has been brutal almost beyond imagining, is in fact
an exaggerated expression of a fully accepted sexual relation between
men and women; and incestuous rape adds a new element of exaggeration,
but the essential sexual relation---the relation of force to
female---remains the same. Therefore, men---especially men responsible
for maintaining the right and role of sexual force in marriage
(lawmakers and theologians)---cannot consider pregnancy resulting from
rape or incestuous rape as]{.font3} [significantly]{.font3} [different
from pregnancy that results from the normal use of a married woman; and
in their frame of reference regarding intercourse, it is not. The
woman's function is to be fucked---and if she is pregnant, then she was
fucked, no matter what the circumstance or the means. Being fucked did
not violate her integrity as a woman because being fucked]{.font3}
[is]{.font3} [her integrity as a woman. Force is intrinsic to fucking,
and the state cannot allow women to determine when they have been raped
(forced), because rape (force) in marriage is supported by the state.
The willingness to consider rape or incestuous rape exceptions at all
comes from the male recognition that a man might not want to accept the
offspring of another man's rape as his own; a father may not want to be
both father and grandfather to the daughter of his daughter. These
exceptions, to the extent that they are or will be honored in
legislation forbidding abortion, exist to protect men. Henry Hyde,
author of the Hyde Amendment forbidding Medicaid money to poor women for
abortions and opponent of all abortion under all circumstances without
exception for rape, was asked by a television interviewer if he would
insist that his daughter carry a pregnancy to term if she were pregnant
as the result of rape. Yes, he answered solemnly. But the question he
should have been asked was this one: suppose his wife were pregnant as
the result of rape? This would impinge not on his sentimentality, but on
his day-to-day right of sexual possession; he would have to live with
the rape and with the carnal reality of the rape and with the pregnancy
resulting from the rape and with the offspring or the damaged woman who
would have to bear it and then give it up. Regardless of his answer to
the hypothetical question, only the male sense of what is at stake for
him in actually having to accept a pregnancy caused by rape or
incestuous rape in his own life as a husband to the woman or girl
involved could make the rape or the woman raped real. Abortion can
protect men, and can be tolerated when it demonstrably does. In terms of
the woman used, herself alone, she is her function; she has been used in
accordance with her function; there is no reason to let her off the hook
just because she was forced by a man not her husband.]{.font3}

[Norman Mailer remarked during the sixties that the problem with the
sexual revolution was that it had gotten into the hands of the wrong
people. He was right. It was in the hands of men.]{.font3}

[The pop idea was that fucking was good, so good that the more there was
of it, the better. The pop idea was that people should fuck whom they
wanted: translated for the girls, this meant that girls should want to
be fucked---as close to all the time as was humanly possible. For women,
alas, all the time is humanly possible with enough changes of partners.
Men envision frequency with reference to their own patterns of erection
and ejaculation. Women got fucked a lot more than men fucked.]{.font3}

[Sexual-revolution philosophy predates the sixties. It shows up in Left
ideologies and movements with regularity---in most countries, in many
different periods, manifest in various leftist "tendencies. " The
sixties in the United States, repeated with different tonalities
throughout Western Europe, had a particularly democratic character. One
did not have to read Wilhelm Reich, though some did. It was simple. A
bunch of nasty bastards who hated making love were making war. A bunch
of boys who liked flowers were making love and refusing to make war.
These boys were wonderful and beautiful. They wanted peace. They talked
love, love, love, not romantic love but love of mankind (translated by
women: humankind). They grew their hair long and painted their faces and
wore colorful clothes and risked being treated]{.font3} [like
girls.]{.font3} [In resisting going to war, they were cowardly and
sissies and weak,]{.font3} [like girls.]{.font3} [No wonder the girls of
the sixties thought that these boys were their special friends, their
special allies, lovers each and every one.]{.font3}

[The girls were real idealists. They hated the Viet Nam War and their
own lives, unlike the boys', were not at stake. They hated the racial
and sexual bigotry visited on blacks, in particular on black men who
were the figures in visible jeopardy. The girls were not all white, but
still the black man was the figure of empathy, the figure whom they
wanted to protect from racist pogroms. Rape was seen as a racist ploy:
not something real in itself used in a racist context to isolate and
destroy black men in specific and strategic ways, but a fabrication, a
figment of the racist imagination.]{.font3}

[The girls were idealistic because, unlike the boys, many of them had
been raped; their lives were at stake. The girls were idealists
especially because they believed in peace and freedom]{.font3} [so
much]{.font3} [that they even thought it was intended for them too. They
knew that their mothers were not free---they saw the small, constrained,
female lives---and they did not want to be their mothers. They accepted
the boys' definition of sexual freedom because it, more than any other
idea or practice, made them different from their mothers. While their
mothers kept sex secret and private, with so much fear and shame, the
girls proclaimed sex their right, their pleasure, their freedom. They
decried the stupidity of their mothers and allied themselves on overt
sexual terms with the longhaired boys who wanted peace, freedom, and
fucking everywhere. This was a world vision that took girls out of the
homes in which their mothers were dull captives or automatons and at the
same time turned the whole world, potentially, into the best possible
home. In other words, the girls did not leave home in order to find
sexual adventure in a sexual jungle; they left home to find a warmer,
kinder, larger, more embracing home.]{.font3}

[Sexual radicalism was defined in classically male terms: number of
partners, frequency of sex, varieties of sex (for instance, group sex),
eagerness to engage in sex. It was all supposed to be essentially the
same for boys and girls: two, three, or however many long-haired persons
communing. It was especially the lessening of gender polarity that kept
the girls entranced, even after the fuck had revealed the boys to be men
after all. Forced sex occurred---it occurred often; but the dream lived
on. Lesbianism was never accepted as lovemaking on its own terms but
rather as a kinky occasion for male voyeurism and the eventual fucking
of two wet women; still, the dream lived on. Male homosexuality was
toyed with, vaguely tolerated, but largely despised and feared because
heterosexual men however bedecked with flowers could not bear to be
fucked "like women"; but the dream lived on. And the dream for the girls
at base was a dream of a sexual and social empathy that negated the
strictures of gender, a dream of sexual equality based on what men and
women had in common, what the adults tried to kill in you as they made
you grow up. It was a desire for a sexual community more like
childhood---before girls were crushed under and segregated. It was a
dream of sexual transcendence: transcending the absolutely dichotomized
male-female world of the adults who made war not love. It was---for the
girls---a dream of being less female in a world less male; an
eroticization of sibling equality, not the traditional male
dominance.]{.font3}

[Wishing did not make it so. Acting as if it were so did not make it so.
Proposing it in commune after commune, to man after man, did not make it
so. Baking bread and demonstrating against the war together did not make
it so. The girls of the sixties lived in what Marxists call, but in this
instance do not recognize as, a "contradiction. " Precisely in trying to
erode the boundaries of gender through an apparent single standard of
sexual-liberation practice, they participated more and more in the most
gender-reifying act: fucking. The men grew more manly; the world of the
counterculture became more aggressively male-dominated. The girls became
women---found themselves possessed by a man or a man and his buddies (in
the parlance of the counterculture, his brothers and hers too)---traded,
gang-fucked, collected, collectivized, objectified, turned into the hot
stuff of pornography, and socially resegregated into traditionally
female roles. Empirically speaking, sexual liberation was practiced by
women on a wide scale in the sixties and it did not work: that is, it
did not free women. Its purpose---it turned out---was to free men to use
women without bourgeois constraints, and in that it was successful. One
consequence for the women was an intensification of the experience of
being sexually female---the precise opposite of what those idealistic
girls had envisioned for themselves. In experiencing a wide variety of
men in a wide variety of circumstances, women who were not prostitutes
discovered the impersonal, class-determined nature of their sexual
function. They discovered the utter irrelevance of their own individual,
aesthetic, ethical, or political sensitivities (whether those
sensitivities were characterized by men as female or bourgeois or
puritanical) in sex as men practiced it. The sexual standard was the
male-to-female fuck, and women served it---it did not serve
women.]{.font3}

[In the sexual-liberation movement of the sixties, its ideology and
practice, neither force nor the subordinate status of women was an
issue. It was assumed that---unrepressed---everyone wanted intercourse
all the time (men, of course, had other important things to do; women
had no legitimate reason not to want to be fucked); and it was assumed
that in women an aversion to intercourse, or not climaxing from
intercourse, or not wanting intercourse at a particular time or with a
particular man, or wanting fewer partners than were available, or
getting tired, or being cross, were all signs of and proof of sexual
repression. Fucking per se was freedom per se. When rape---obvious,
clear, brutal rape---occurred, it was ignored, often for political
reasons if the rapist was black and the woman white. Interestingly, in a
racially constructed rape, the rape was likely to be credited as such,
even when ultimately ignored. When a white man raped a white woman,
there was no vocabulary to describe it. It was an event that occurred
outside the political discourse of the generation in question and
therefore it did not exist. When a black woman was raped by a white man,
the degree of recognition depended on the state of alliances between
black and white men in the social territory involved: whether, at any
given time, they were sharing women or fighting territorially over them.
A black woman raped by a black man had the special burden of not
jeopardizing her own race, endangered especially by charges of rape, by
calling attention to any such brutality committed against her. Beatings
and forced intercourse were commonplace in the counterculture. Even more
widespread was the social and economic coercion of women to engage in
sex with men. Yet no antagonism was seen to exist between sexual force
and sexual freedom: one did not preclude the other. Implicit was the
conviction that force would not be necessary if women were not
repressed; women would want to fuck and would not have to be forced to
fuck; so that it was repression, not force, that stood in the way of
freedom.]{.font3}

[Sexual-liberation ideology, whether pop or traditionally
leftist-intellectual, did not criticize, analyze, or repudiate forced
sex, nor did it demand an end to the sexual and social subordination of
women to men: neither reality was recognized. Instead, it posited that
freedom for women existed in being fucked more often by more men, a sort
of lateral mobility in the same inferior sphere. No persons were held
responsible for forced sex acts, rapes, beatings of women, unless the
women themselves were blamed---usually for not complying in the first
place. These were in the main women who wanted to comply---who wanted
the promised land of sexual freedom---and still they had limits,
preferences, tastes, desires for intimacy with some men and not others,
moods not necessarily related to menstruation or the phases of the moon,
days on which they would rather work or read; and they were punished for
all these puritanical repressions, these petit bourgeois lapses, these
tiny exercises of tinier wills not in conformity with the wills of their
brother-lovers: force was frequently used against them, or they were
threatened or humiliated or thrown out. No diminution of flower power,
peace, freedom, political correctness, or justice was seen to be
implicit in the use of coercion in any form to get sexual
compliance.]{.font3}

[In the garden of earthly delights known as the sixties counterculture,
pregnancy did intrude, almost always rudely; and even then and there it
was one of the real obstacles to female fucking on male demand. It made
women ambivalent, reluctant, concerned, cross, preoccupied; it even led
women to say no. Throughout the sixties, the birth control pill was not
easy to get, and nothing else was sure. Unmarried women had an
especially hard time getting access to contraceptive devices, including
the diaphragm, and abortion was illegal and dangerous. Fear of pregnancy
provided a reason for saying no: not just an excuse but a concrete
reason not easily seduced or persuaded away, even by the most astute or
dazzling argument in behalf of sexual freedom. Especially difficult to
sway were the women who had had illegal abortions already. Whatever they
thought of fucking, however they experienced it, however much they loved
or tolerated it, they knew that for them it had consequences in blood
and pain and they knew that it cost the men nothing, except sometimes
money. Pregnancy was a material reality, and it could not be argued
away. One tactic used to counterbalance the high anxiety caused by the
possibility of pregnancy was the esteem in which "natural" women were
held---women who were "natural" in all respects, who wanted organic
fucking (no birth control, whatever children resulted) and organic
vegetables too. Another tactic was to stress the communal raising of
children, to promise it. Women were not punished in the conventional
ways for bearing the children---they were not labeled "bad" or
shunned---but they were frequently abandoned. A woman and her
child---poor and relatively outcast---wandering within the
counterculture changed the quality of the hedonism in the communities in
which they intruded: the mother-and-child pair embodied a different
strain of reality, not a welcome one for the most part. There were lone
women struggling to raise children "freely" and they got in the way of
the males who saw freedom as the fuck---and the fuck ended for the males
when the fuck ended. These women with children made the other women a
little somber, a little concerned, a little careful. Pregnancy, the fact
of it, was antiaphrodisiacal. Pregnancy, the burden of it, made it
harder for the flower boys to fuck the flower girls, who did not want to
have to claw out their own insides or pay someone else to do it; they
also did not want to die.]{.font3}

[It was the brake that pregnancy put on fucking that made abortion a
high-priority political issue for men in the 1960s---not only for young
men, but also for the older leftist men who were skimming sex off the
top of the counterculture and even for more traditional men who dipped
into the pool of hippie girls now and then. The decriminalization of
abortion---for that was the political goal ---was seen as the final
fillip: it would make women absolutely accessible, absolutely "free. "
The sexual revolution, in order to work, required that abortion be
available to women on demand. If it were not, fucking would not be
available to men on demand. Getting laid was at stake. Not just getting
laid, but getting laid the way great numbers of boys and men had always
wanted---lots of girls who wanted it all the time outside marriage,
free, giving it away. The male-dominated Left agitated for and fought
for and argued for and even organized for and even provided political
and economic resources for abortion rights for women. The Left was
militant on the issue.]{.font3}

[Then, at the very end of the sixties, women who had been radical in
counterculture terms---women who had been both politically and sexually
active---became radical in new terms: they became feminists. They were
not Betty Friedan's housewives. They had fought out on the streets
against the Viet Nam War; some of them were old enough to have fought in
the South for black civil rights, and all had come into adulthood on the
back of that struggle; and lord knows, they had been fucked. As Marge
Piercy wrote in a 1969 expose of sex and politics in the
counterculture:]{.font3}

[Or, as Robin Morgan wrote in 1970: "We have met the enemy and he's our
friend. And dangerous. "^6^ Acknowledging the forced sex so pervasive in
the counterculture in the language of the counterculture, Morgan wrote:
"It hurts to understand that at Woodstock or Altamont a woman could be
declared uptight or a poor sport if she didn't want to be raped. "^7^
These were the beginnings: recognizing that the brother-lovers were
sexual exploiters as cynical as any other exploiters---they ruled and
demeaned and discarded women, they used women to get and consolidate
power, they used women for sex and for menial labor, they used women up;
recognizing that rape was a matter of utter indifference to these
brother-lovers---they took it any way they could get it; and recognizing
that all the work for justice had been done on the backs of sexually
exploited women within the movement. "But surely, " wrote Robin Morgan
in 1968, "even a male reactionary on this issue can realize that it
is]{.font3} [really]{.font3} [mind-blowing to hear some young male
'revolutionary'---supposedly dedicated to building a new, free social
order to replace this vicious one under which we live---turn around and
absent-mindedly order his 'chick' to shut up and make supper or wash his
socks---]{.font3}[he\'s]{.font3} [talking now. We're used to such
attitudes from the average American clod, but from this brave new
radical? "^8^]{.font3}

[It was the raw, terrible realization that sex was not brother-sister
but master-servant---that this brave new radical wanted to be not only
master in his own home but pasha in his own harem---that proved
explosive. The women ignited with the realization that they had been
sexually used. Going beyond the male agenda on sexual liberation, these
women discussed sex and politics with one another---something not done
even when they had shared the same bed with the same man---and
discovered that their experiences had been staggeringly the same,
ranging from forced sex to sexual humiliation to abandonment to cynical
manipulation as both menials and pieces of ass. And the men were
entrenched in sex as power: they wanted the women for fucking, not
revolution: the two were revealed to be different after all. The men
refused to change but even more important they hated the women for
refusing to service them anymore on the old terms---there it was,
revealed for what it was. The women left the men---in droves. The women
formed an autonomous women's movement, a militant feminist movement, to
fight against the sexual cruelty they had experienced and to fight for
the sexual justice they had been denied.]{.font3}

[From their own experience---especially in being coerced and in being
exchanged---the women found a first premise for their political
movement: that freedom for a woman was predicated on, and could not
exist without, her own absolute control of her own body in sex and in
reproduction. This included not only the right to terminate a pregnancy
but also the right to not have sex, to say no, to not be fucked. For
women, this led to many areas of sexual discovery about the nature and
politics of their own sexual desire, but for men it was a dead
end---most of them never recognized feminism except in terms of their
own sexual deprivation; feminists were taking away the easy fuck. They
did everything they could to break the back of the feminist
movement---and in fact they have not stopped yet. Especially significant
has been their change of heart and politics on abortion. The right to
abortion defined as an intrinsic part of the sexual revolution was
essential to them: who could bear the horror and cruelty and stupidity
of illegal abortion? The right to abortion defined as an intrinsic part
of a woman's right to control her own body, in sex too, was a matter of
supreme indifference.]{.font3}

[Material resources dried up. Feminists fought the battle for
decriminalized abortion---no laws governing abortion---on the streets
and in the courts with severely diminished male support. In 1973, the
Supreme Court gave women legalized abortion: abortion regulated by the
state.]{.font3}

[If before the Supreme Court decision in 1973 leftist men expressed a
fierce indifference to abortion rights on feminist terms, after 1973
indifference changed to overt hostility: feminists had the right to
abortion and were still saying no---no to sex on male terms and no to
politics dominated by these same men. Legalized abortion did not make
these women more available for sex; on the contrary, the women's
movement was growing in size and importance and male sexual privilege
was being challenged with more intensity, more commitment, more
ambition. The leftist men turned from political activism: without the
easy lay, they were not prepared to engage in radical politics. In
therapy they discovered that they had had personalities in the womb,
that they had suffered traumas in the womb. Fetal psychology---tracing a
grown man's life back into the womb, where, as a fetus, he had a whole
human self and psychology---developed on the therapeutic Left (the
residue of the male counterculture Left) before any right-wing minister
or lawmaker ever thought to make a political stand on the right of
fertilized eggs as persons to the protection of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which is in fact the goal of antiabortion activists.
[\*]{.sgc-16} The argument that abortion was a form of genocide directed
particularly at blacks gained political currency, even though feminists
from the first based part of the feminist case on the real facts and
figures---black and Hispanic women died and were hurt disproportionately
in illegal abortions. As early as 1970, these figures were available
in]{.font3} [Sisterhood Is Powerful:]{.font3} ["4. 7 times as many
Puerto Rican women, and 8 times as many black women die of the
consequences of illegal abortions as do white women\... In New York
City, 80 percent of the women who die from abortions are black and
brown. "^9^ And on the nonviolent Left, abortion was increasingly
considered murder---murder in the most grandiose terms. "Abortion is the
domestic side of the nuclear arms race, "^10^ wrote one male pacifist in
a 1980 tract not at all singular in the scale and tone of its
denunciation. Without the easy fuck, things sure had changed on the
Left.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, has five
sections, the first of which is crucial here, the second of which is
interesting. Section 1: "All persons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. " The
second section guarantees the vote to all males. It was purposely
written to exclude women. Even though women have subsequently been given
the vote, laws in the United States routinely abridge the privileges and
immunities of women and deprive women of liberty and property (there are
still states in which married women cannot own property on their
own)---and women do not have equal protection of the laws. The fetus,
once legally a "person, " would have all the protections guaranteed by
this amendment but not in practice extended to women. The Equal Rights
Amendment was in large part an effort to extend the protections of the
Fourteenth Amendment to women.]{.sgc-3}

[The Democratic Party, establishment home of many Left groups,
especially since the end of the 1960s ferment, had conceded abortion
rights as early as 1972, when George McGovern ran against Richard Nixon
and refused to take a stand for abortion so that he could fight against
the Viet Nam War and for the presidency without distraction. When the
Hyde Amendment cutting off Medicaid funding for abortions was passed in
1976, [\*]{.sgc-16} it had Jesse Jackson's support: he had sent
telegrams to all members of Congress supporting the cutoff of funds.
Court challenges delayed the implementation of the Hyde Amendment, but
Jimmy Carter, elected with the help of feminist and leftist groups in
the Democratic Party, had his man, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., head of the
then Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, halt federal funding
of abortion by administrative order. By 1977 the first documented death
of a poor woman (Hispanic) from an illegal abortion had occurred:
illegal abortion and death were again realities for women in the United
States. In the face of the so-called human-life amendment and human-life
statute---respectively a constitutional amendment and a bill of law
defining a fertilized egg as a human being---the male Left has simply
played dead.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[Except when the mother's life is at stake in the original
version (Hyde's version); as amended in the Senate, also in cases of
rape and incest.]{.sgc-3}

[The male Left abandoned abortion rights for genuinely awful reasons:
the boys were not getting laid; there was bitterness and anger against
feminists for ending a movement (by withdrawing from it) that was both
power and sex for the men; there was also the familiar callous
indifference of the sexual exploiter---if he couldn't screw her she
wasn't real.]{.font3}

[The hope of the male Left is that the loss of abortion rights will
drive women back into the ranks---even fear of losing might do that; and
the male Left has done what it can to assure the loss. The Left has
created a vacuum that the Right has expanded to fill---this the Left did
by abandoning a just cause, by its decade of quietism, by its decade of
sulking. But the Left has not just been an absence; it has been a
presence, outraged at women's controlling their own bodies, outraged at
women's organizing against sexual exploitation, which by definition
means women also organizing against the sexual values of the Left. When
feminist women have lost legal abortion altogether, leftist men expect
them back---begging for help, properly chastened, ready to make a deal,
ready to spread their legs again. On the Left, women will have abortion
on male terms, as part of sexual liberation, or women will not have
abortion except at risk of death.]{.font3}

[And the boys of the sixties did grow up too. They actually grew older.
They are now men in life, not just in the fuck. They want babies.
Compulsory pregnancy is about the only way they are sure to get
them.]{.font3}

[The girls of the sixties had mothers who predicted, insisted, argued
that those girls would be hurt; but they would not say how or why. In
the main, the mothers appeared to be sexual conservatives: they upheld
the marriage system as a social ideal and were silent about the sex in
it. Sex was a duty inside marriage; a wife's attitude toward it was
irrelevant unless she made trouble, went crazy, fucked around. Mothers
had to teach their daughters to like men as a class---be responsive to
men as men, warm to men as men---and at the same time to not have sex.
Since males mostly wanted the girls for sex, it was hard for the girls
to understand how to like boys and men without also liking the sex boys
and men wanted. The girls were told nice things about human sexuality
and also told that it would cost them their lives---one way or another.
The mothers walked a tough line: give the girls a good attitude, but
discourage them. The cruelty of the ambivalence communicated itself, but
the kindness in the intention did not: mothers tried to protect their
daughters from many men by directing them toward one; mothers tried to
protect their daughters by getting them to do what was necessary inside
the male system without ever explaining why. They had no vocabulary for
the why---why sex inside marriage was good but outside marriage was bad,
why more than one man turned a girl from a loving woman into a whore,
why leprosy or paralysis were states preferable to pregnancy outside
marriage. They had epithets to hurl, but no other discourse. Silence
about sex in marriage was also the only way to avoid revelations bound
to terrify---revelations about the quality of the mothers' own lives.
Sexual compliance or submission was presented as the wife's natural
function and also her natural response to her sexual circumstance. That
compliance was never seen or presented as the result of actual force,
threatened force, possible force, or a sexual and social cul-de-sac. It
has always been essential to keep women riveted on the details of
submission so as to divert women from thinking about the nature of
force---especially the sexual force that necessitates sexual submission.
The mothers could not ward off the enthusiasm of sexual liberation---its
energy, its hope, its bright promise of sexual equality---because they
could not or would not tell what they knew about the nature and quality
of male sexuality as they had experienced it, as practiced on them in
marriage. They knew the simple logic of promiscuity, which the girls did
not: that what one man could do, ten men could do ten times over. The
girls did not understand that logic because the girls did not know fully
what one man could do. And the mothers failed to convince also because
the only life they offered was a repeat version of their own: and the
girls were close enough to feel the inconsolable sadness and the dead
tiredness of those lives, even if they did not know how or why mother
had gotten the way she was. The girls, having been taught well by their
mothers to like men because they were men, picked flower-children boys
over their mothers: they did not look for husbands (fathers) as dictated
by convention but for brothers (lovers) as dictated by rebellion. The
daughters saw the strained silence of their mothers on sex as a
repudiation of the pleasure of sex, not as an honest though inarticulate
assessment of it. The disdain, disapproval, repugnance for sex was not
credited as having any objective component. What their mothers would not
tell them they could not know. They repudiated the putative sexual
conservatism of their mothers for so-called sexual radicalism: more men,
more sex, more freedom.]{.font3}

[The girls of the counterculture Left were wrong: not about civil rights
or the Viet Nam War or imperial Amerika, but about sex and men. It is
fair to say that the silence of the mothers hid a real, tough,
unsentimental knowledge of men and intercourse, and that the noisy
sexuality of the daughters hid romantic ignorance.]{.font3}

[Times have changed. The silence has been shattered---or parts of it
have been shattered. Right-wing women defending the traditional family
are public; they are loud and they are many. Especially they are loud
about legal abortion, which they abhor; and what they have to say about
legal abortion is connected to what they know about sex. They know some
terrible things. Right-wing women consistently denounce abortion because
they see it as inextricably linked to the sexual degradation of women.
The sixties did not simply pass them by. They learned from what they
saw. They saw the cynical male use of abortion to make women easier
fucks--- first the political use of the issue and then, after
legalization, the actual use of the medical procedure. When abortion was
legal, they saw a massive social move to secure sexual access to all
women on male terms---the glut of pornography; and indeed, they link the
two issues, and not for reasons of hysteria. Abortion, they say,
flourishes in a pornographic society; pornography, they say, flourishes
in what they call an abortion society. What they mean is that both
reduce women to the fuck. They have seen that the Left only champions
women on its own sexual terms---as fucks; they find the right-wing offer
a tad more generous. They are not dazzled by the promise of abortion as
choice, as sexual self-determination, as woman's control of her own
body, because they know that the promise is crap: as long as men have
power over women, men will not allow abortion or anything else on those
terms.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women see in promiscuity, which legal abortion makes easier,
the generalizing of force. They see force in marriage as essentially
containable---contained within the marriage, limited to one man at a
time. They try to "handle" him. They see that limitation---one man at a
time---as necessary protection from the many men who would do the same
and to whom they would be available on sexual-liberation terms---terms
fortified and made genuinely possible by abortion rights. With all their
new public talk, they continue the traditional silence of women in that
they are silent about forced sex in marriage: but all they do is
predicated on a knowledge of it, and they do not see how more force is
better than less force---and more men means more force to them.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women accuse feminists of hypocrisy and cruelty in
advocating legal abortion because, as they see it, legal abortion makes
them accessible fucks without consequence to men. In their view,
pregnancy is the only consequence of sex that makes men accountable to
women for what men do to women. Deprived of pregnancy as an
inevitability, a woman is deprived of her strongest reason not to have
intercourse. Opposition to birth control is based on this same
principle.]{.font3}

[Right-wing women saw the cynicism of the Left in using abortion to make
women sexually available, and they also saw the male Left abandon women
who said no. They know that men do not have principles or political
agendas not congruent with the sex they want. They know that abortion on
strictly self-actualizing terms for women is an abomination to
men---left-wing men and right-wing men and gray men and green men. They
know that every woman has to make the best deal she can. They face
reality and what they see is that women get fucked whether they want it
or not; right-wing women get fucked by fewer men; abortion in the open
takes away pregnancy as a social and sexual control over men; once a
woman can terminate a pregnancy easily and openly and without risk of
death, she is bereft of her best way of saying no--- of refusing the
intercourse the male wants to force her to accept. The consequences of
pregnancy to him may stop him, as the consequences of pregnancy to her
never will. The right-wing woman makes what she considers the best deal.
Her deal promises that she has to be fucked only by him, not by all his
buddies too; that he will pay for the kids; that she can live in his
house on his wages; and she smiles and says she wants to be a mommy and
play house. If in order to keep pregnancy as a weapon of survival she
has to accept illegal abortion and risk death, she will do it---alone,
in silence, isolated, the only reproach for her rebellion against actual
pregnancy being death or maiming. In this mess of illegal abortion, she
will have confirmed what she has been taught about her own nature as a
woman and about all women. She deserves punishment; illegal abortion is
punishment for sex. She feels shame: she may consider it the shame of
sex but it is in part the shame that any human in captivity feels in
being used---women being used in sex feel shame inseparable from sex.
The shame will confirm that she deserves suffering; suffering in sex and
birth and aborted birth is the curse of her sex; illegal abortion is
deserved suffering. But illegal abortion also serves her because it puts
abortion out of sight. No one has to be confronted with another woman
making a choice, choosing not to be a mother. No one must face women
openly with priorities other than marriage and conformity. No one must
face a woman refusing to be bound by pregnancy. The women who rebel
against their function must do it secretly, not causing grief,
embarrassment, or confusion to other women isolated in their own
reproductive quagmires, each on her own, each alone, each being a woman
for all women in silence and in suffering and in solitude. With illegal
abortion life or death is up to God: each time, one submits to the
divine hand, divine finger on divine revolver pointed at the already
bloody flesh of a woman, divine Russian roulette. It is a final,
humiliated submission to the will of a superior Male who judges
absolutely. Death is a judgment and so is life. Illegal abortion is an
individual hell; one suffers, does penance: God decides; life is
forgiveness. And no one need face it until it happens to her---until she
is the one caught. This is the way in which women are moral idiots in
this system: ignoring whatever has to do with other women, all women,
until or unless it happens to oneself. Right-wing women also believe
that a woman who refuses to bear a child deserves to die. Right-wing
women are prepared to accept that judgment against themselves; and when
they survive, they are guilty and prepared to pay---to martyr themselves
for an act of will to which they had no right as women. There is no
better measure of what forced sex does to women---how it destroys
self-respect and the will to survive as a self-determining human
being---than the opposition of right-wing women to legal abortion: to
what they need to save themselves from being butchered. The training of
a girl to accept her place in sex in marriage and the use of a woman in
sex in marriage means the annihilating of any will toward
self-determination or freedom; her personhood is so demeaned that it
becomes easier to risk death or maiming than to say no to a man who will
fuck you anyway, with the blessings of God and state, 'til death do you
part.]{.font3}

[A minister from Oklahoma, dressed in a shiny brown polyester suit, hair
greased down even shinier than the shiny suit, smile from ear to ear
even shinier than the shiny hair, was picketing, leafleting, and
preaching outside the Sam Houston Coliseum in Houston. He was full of
love for the Lord, love for his neighbors, the love of Christ; it was
sin he hated, especially when it was embodied in the filthy lesbians who
had come to Houston to destroy the work of God. He kept preaching to the
feminists converging on the Coliseum that nothing was as loathsome as
homosexuality; but in women! to contemplate the abomination in women
whom God commanded to obey their husbands as Christ was so repugnant to
this minister that he predicted God might call down the walls of the
Coliseum then and there. I approached him alone to talk as other women
ignored him entirely. I asked him what he thought of the high-spirited,
vital women going in: did they all seem evil and loathsome? could he
tell which were lesbians and which were not? what kind of harm did
lesbians do to other people? if lesbians did no one harm (for instance,
did not murder, did not rape), why was he, a minister, called on to
denounce lesbians? was not this particular sin, so singularly lacking in
malice, better left to God to judge? why did lesbians provoke not only
God's judgment but also the minister's wrath? He referred to these
passages from Romans: \*]{.font3}

> ^1^]{.font3}

[I asked the minister how Christians who value obedience to God's
literal word justified such a radical reinterpretation of the Old
Testament. The New Testament, he said, was concealed in the Old
Testament; nothing in it was really new in the sense of being original;
the New Testament made God's real meaning clear; the Jews had become
blind to the spirit of the law---enter the Holy Spirit and the revealed
word. I suggested that the anti-Jewish tone of some of the New Testament
might be considered new and that it was possibly related to what I at
least considered a new attitude toward lesbians: Jews and female
homosexuals, politically united by damnation for the first time. In
Romans, Jews are abandoned by God the Father; the covenant of manhood,
sealed by circumcision, loses its meaning:]{.font3}

> [For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither]{.font3} [is
> *that*]{.font3} [circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:]{.font3}
>
> [But he]{.font3} [is]{.font3} [a Jew, which is one inwardly; and
> circumcision]{.font3} [is]{.font3}
>
> [that]{.font3 .sgc-3} [of the heart, in the spirit,]{.font3}
> [and]{.font3 .sgc-3} [not in the letter\... \*]{.font3}

[Romans 2: 28-29]{.font3}

[The Gentile gets God's masculinity (a new God, God the Son) without an
outward mark. The cutting of the penis no longer means masculinity; it
begins to resemble castration. All the feminized creatures---Jews,
unnatural women (lesbians), unnatural men (homosexuals)---are linked
together in Romans and are promised God's "indignation and wrath"
(Romans 2: 8). The Jews who obey the law are replaced by the Christians
who know the law not by learning it but by being it. The first Christian
hit list of sinners is compiled: lesbians, male homosexuals,
Jews.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[Revised Standard Version: "real circumcision is a matter
of the heart, spiritual and not literal. "]{.sgc-11}

[Talk of the Jews animated the minister. He was married to a Jewish
girl. He supported the state of Israel: see Amos, ninth chapter. The
Jews were up on his pedestal. But the Jews, I insisted, did not abhor
lesbians or forbid lesbian acts or damn or search out or ostracize
lesbians: not by law or by actual practice. Christ, he said at some
length and with no small amount of bitterness, had died because the Jews
had overlooked a lot. The Jews had had some funny ideas until Paul came
along.]{.font3}

[But where, I asked him, did he get his sense of personal repugnance?
Didn't I see how vile a sin it was, he asked, referring back to the New
Testament, which condemned not only lesbians and all homosexuals but
also those who accepted in others this most heinous of sins? And didn't
I understand what lesbians and male homosexuals were by nature: filled
with wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, envy, murder, strife,
deceit, malignity; backbiters, haters of God, inventors of evil things,
without natural affection, unmerciful. Romans, it must be apparent, is
not kind in its estimation of homosexuals, male or female. Any Christian
who meets homosexuality in the pages of the New Testament for the first
time is likely to fear homosexuals, hate homosexuals, and despise any
liberal tolerance for that viciousness that God abhors. The New
Testament damns those who tolerate homosexuality; and the New Testament
does say that homosexuals "are worthy of death. "]{.font3}

[In the course of my conversation with the minister, a group of women
had gathered around us. The weather was beautiful, the convention
exciting, the women were high on goodwill and feminist dreams of
sisterhood and solidarity. The women, it must be said, were nice and
happy and enthusiastic and everyone was pretty from radiant smiles and
high hopes. The minister's style was nice too---outgoing, sincere, warm,
expansive, full of prejudiced conviction but without meanness. He did
not want to hurt anyone. He hated sin, and especially he found lesbian
sin loathsome; but it was a conviction pure in its detachment from
individual human beings---he had never seen one. Many of the women
listening giggled as he and I talked. But what about these women, I
asked, or what about me? Are we all damned? Are we bad? Do you know
which of us is lesbian? Are we all full of envy, murder, strife, deceit,
malignity? Are we without natural affection or unmerciful? He looked up
and around and his skin crawled. He reacted to the sight of us suddenly
as frightened girls do to mice or bugs or spiders.]{.font3}

[The women's movement, he said, was a communist conspiracy, an internal
poison in America. The communists wanted abortion legalized in the
United States in order to exterminate Americans and to damn us in God's
eyes. The Russians invented abortion and they insidiously had the
ideology of abortion planted in the United States by agents and dupes;
and the liberals and the Jews spread it. And now the communists had new
tactics---lesbians in the women's movement. It was a Russian plot to
turn the United States into Sodom and Gomorrah so that God would hate
the United States and destroy it and the Russians would win; and Marx,
the anti-Christ, had been a Jew, and a lot of lesbians were Jews, he was
no anti-Semite, he had married a Jewish girl but of course she had been
baptized and had accepted Christ. The Bible---meaning the New Testament
because the Old Testament had really become irrelevant since the New
Testament fully revealed what had been concealed in the Old
Testament---was the only hope for America's survival because it revealed
God's will. A strong and righteous nation depends on fulfilling God's
will. God's will is that wives obey their husbands, who are as Christ to
them. Husbands must love their wives; wives must obey their husbands.
The feminists in Houston (who were, in fact, entering the Coliseum
almost two by two in a sacrilegious if unintentional parody of Noah's
Ark) were part of the communist plan to spread lesbianism, destroy the
family by destroying the wife's obedience to Christ through the agency
of her husband: the feminists were going to destroy the United States by
spreading evil. The minister's eyes were darting in all directions and
he seemed visibly sick from the sudden recognition that the women around
him and the woman he was talking to might actually be lesbians, and some
certainly were: full of malignity, inventors of evil things. I asked him
if I could talk with him again, some other time. He moved away,
repelled, nervous, silent, the rich evangelical blather with which he
had been fulminating when I first encountered him now stopped entirely.
He had actually been near some real ones, unnatural, worthy of
death.]{.font3}

[Inside the Coliseum too there was a right-wing Christian presence. In
Mississippi and Utah, official convention delegates not only embodied
opposition to all women's rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment,
but were linked with the Ku Klux Klan. The Utah delegation, in a press
release, denied any association with the Klan and claimed that the
sponsors of the conference "have sought to destroy our credibility by
name-calling and trying to link us with extremist groups like the
Ku-Klux Klan. " The Utah delegation considered the whole conference a
propaganda effort "carefully designed to quash the views of women
opposing the ]{.font3}[Equal Rights Amendment and reproductive freedom
recommendations. "^2^ The National Commission on the Observance of
International Women's Year (IWY) announced in September, two months
before the conference, its decision to uphold the right of all elected
delegates to participate in the convention unless election fraud could
be proven. State elections were supposed to include in the official
delegations "groups which work to advance the rights of women; and
members of the general public, with special emphasis on the
representation of low-income women, members of diverse racial, ethnic
and religious groups, and women of all ages. "^3^ The true wrath of the
IWY Commission was, in fact, for the racist composition of several of
the delegations from right-wing states. Alabama was cited as a state
"whose population is 26. 2 per cent black, yet will be represented in
Houston by 24 delegates, 22 of whom are white. "^4^ Mississippi stood
out as the most vicious violator of the law's intent. The IWY Commission
characterized Mississippi as "a state whose population is 36. 8 per cent
black, and yet will be represented in Houston by an all-white
delegation, five of whom are men, whose election is alleged by local
authorities to be the result of Klanlike activities. " An individual who
identified himself as Grand Dragon of the Realm of Mississippi, United
Klans of America, Inc., Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, claimed: "We
controlled the one \[delegation\] in Mississippi. "^5^]{.sgc-6}

[I interviewed a man from the Mississippi delegation on the convention
floor. Press access to the official elected delegates when the
convention was in session was tightly controlled. The system of access
strongly favored male reporters, since permanent floor passes were
handed out to dailies, whose representatives were mostly male. The
women's monthly magazines were low on the priority list of media
coverage: and most of the reporters for those monthly women's journals
were women. As a result, someone like myself, representing]{.font3}
[Ms]{.font3}[., had at most a half hour on the floor with the delegates
at any single time, a very long wait for that half hour of access---and
the prospect of being physically thrown out as soon as one's time was
up. So when I raced in, I raced right over to the Mississippi
delegation.]{.font3}

[I asked several women to talk with me. They refused even to look at me.
Whoever managed them disciplined them well. They were a wall of silence.
Finally I approached a man sitting on an aisle. I said that I was
from]{.font3} [Ms.]{.font3} [magazine and would like to ask him some
questions. I was wearing overalls and a T-shirt, and a press pass
with]{.font3} [Ms.]{.font3} [in large inked letters was hanging from my
neck. The man laughed and turned to the woman next to him, whispered in
her ear, she laughed and turned to the woman next to her and whispered
in her ear, she laughed and turned to the woman next to her and
whispered in her ear, and so on down the row of delegates. The man did
not turn back to me until the identification had been passed to the end
of the line. Some of the women had not laughed; they had
gasped.]{.font3}

[I asked the man why he was at the conference. He said that his wife had
wanted him to be there to protect women's right to procreate and to have
a family.]{.font3} [I]{.font2 .sgc-1} [asked him if he was a member of
the Klan. He claimed high office in the organization. He talked about
the Klan's militant role in protecting women from all kinds. He himself
was physically rather slight, not particularly tall, wore glasses; I
suspected I was physically stronger than he was. Many times during the
interview I realized that it would take a white sheet and all that that
white sheet symbolized to hide this man's own physical vulnerability to
attack. He himself was nondescript; the Klan was not. When]{.font3}
[I]{.font2 .sgc-1} [recognized the fear this man inspired in me, and
measured that fear against his own physical presence,]{.font3}
[I]{.font2 .sgc-1} [felt ashamed: and yet]{.font3} [I]{.font2 .sgc-1}
[was still afraid of him.\*]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[Klan and Nazi groups threatened violence at the
convention: we were promised bombings and beatings. Some women were in
fact beaten up, others were physically threatened, and the possibility
of being hurt was considered both real and immediate by all the
conference participants with whom I talked.]{.sgc-11}

[He said that women needed the protection of men. He said that the Klan
had sent men to the convention to protect their womenfolk from the
lesbians, who would assault them. He said that it was necessary to
protect women's right to have families because that was the key to the
stability of the nation. He said that homosexuality was a Jew sickness.
He said that homosexuality was a lust that threatened to wipe out the
family. He said that homosexual teachers should be found out and run out
of any town they were in. They could all go to Jew New York. Trying to
keep up my end of the conversation, I asked him why he was against
homosexual teachers, especially if their homosexuality was private. He
said that there was no such thing as private homosexuality, that if
homosexuals were in schools, children would be corrupted and tainted and
molested and taught to hate God and the family; homosexuality would
claim the women and the children if they were exposed to it; its
presence at all, even hidden, anywhere, would take people from family
life and put them into sin. His description was almost voluptuous in
that no one, in his estimation, would remain untouched.]{.font3}

[Are you really saying, I asked slowly and clearly and loudly (so that
the women delegates could continue to overhear the conversation), that
if homosexuality were openly visible as a sexual possibility or if there
were homosexual teachers in schools, everyone would choose to abandon
heterosexuality and the family? Are you really saying, I asked carefully
and clearly and slowly, that homosexuality is so attractive that no one
would choose the heterosexual family over it? He stared at me, silent, a
long time. I am afraid of violence and the Klan, and I was afraid of
him. I repeated my questions. "You're a Jew, ain't ya, " he said and
turned away from me, stared straight ahead. All the women in the row who
had been looking at me also turned away and stared straight ahead in
utter silence. The only woman whose head had been otherwise engaged had
not looked up except once: she had taken one hard stare at me in the
beginning and had then turned back to her work: knitting blue baby
booties, the Klan's own Madame Defarge; and I could imagine my name
being transferred by the work of those hands from the press pass on my
chest into that baby-blue wool. She sat next to the Klansman, and she
knitted and knitted. Yes, I am a Jew, I said. I repeated my questions.
He memorized my face, then stared straight ahead.]{.font3}

[In my few remaining minutes on the floor, I implored the Mississippi
women to talk to me. I went hurriedly from row to row, expecting
somewhere to find one rebellious sign of interest or simple compassion.
One woman dared to speak to me in whispers, but did not dare look at me;
instead she looked down into her own lap, and the woman next to her got
jittery and upset and kept telling her to "think again. " She whispered
that she was against the Equal Rights Amendment because girls would have
to go to war. I said: we say we love our children but isn't it true that
if we send our boys to war we can't love them very much? why are we
willing to have them killed if we love them? At this point the marshals
forced me physically to leave the floor. They did not ask or tell or
say, "Time's up"; they pushed.\*]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[The system of press access to the convention floor that
favored male journalists over female was set up by a male "feminist. "
It was outrageously, unashamedly, and inexcusably
sex-discriminatory.]{.sgc-11}

[In the face of the Klan and the marshals, I risked one more trip back
to the Mississippi delegation. On the floor, delegates were milling
around; it was a brief recess (but the same strict time limits applied
for journalists). In the sheer confusion of the numbers and the noise,
the discipline of the Mississippi delegation had relaxed slightly. A
Mississippi woman explained to me that as a Christian woman she was in a
superior position, and that this superior position was not to be traded
for an equal position. I asked her if she really meant to say that boys
were less valuable; and was that why we sacrificed them in
wars---because we didn't think they were worth very much? She said that
it was the nature of boys to guard and to protect, which included going
to war and also taking care of their families. She was not prepared to
say that boys were less valuable than girls, only that women were
superior to men in Christianity, had a favored place based on and
because of the male's role as protector. God, she said, wanted her
husband to protect her. The Equal Rights Amendment would force her to
take responsibility for decision making and for money. She did not want
to take this responsibility because to do so would be against the will
of God. She then said that she was equal spiritually in God's eyes but
in no other way. I said that seemed to mean that in every other way she
was inferior, not superior. She said that feminists want women and men
to be the same but that God says they are different. The Equal Rights
Amendment would permit homosexuality because men and women would no
longer be as different as God wanted them to be. Being homosexual was a
sin because women tried to be the same as men, and homosexuality
confused the differences between men and women, those differences being
the will of God. The recess ended, and with the return of order
(delegates seated and under discipline again) no more talk between the
Mississippi woman and myself was possible. The marshals approached;
don't you fucking touch me, I said loudly, ending forever the
possibility of further conversation with the Mississippi delegation; and
I ran out fast so that the marshals fucking wouldn't touch me.]{.font3}

[The Utah delegation had women supporters who attended the convention as
observers, a non voting status. Most of the right-wing women did not
care to attend the conference unless they were delegates; instead they
attended Phyllis Schlafly's counterconvention in another part of town. I
was interested in the Utah women because they had wanted to show
themselves in an arena where they were a small and unpopular minority.
They all wore similar black dresses, mourning I supposed for the unborn,
mourning perhaps for us all, the feminists so ungodly who surrounded
them. The Mississippi delegation had been a unit unto itself, not
interacting at all with the world of people and ideas around them. My
own evaluation was that indeed the Mississippi delegation had strong
Klan participation and leadership; more generally, it was not only
male-dominated but male-controlled, almost martially controlled. The
Utah delegation with its supporters who dared to mingle with the
enthusiastic feminists who numbered in the thousands acted with a
different kind of conviction: the women were especially concerned with
stopping abortion; they were passionate advocates of their values, tied
to the Mormon Church, perhaps under direct orders, but nevertheless
speaking for themselves with emotional conviction. A state legislator
from Utah, an official delegate, was stern, forbidding, serious, and
willing to exercise what power she had in the service of her beliefs:
the Equal Rights Amendment legalizes abortion; \* the Supreme Court, in
saying that all women could have abortions, opened the door for the
state to say that all women must have abortions; pro-ERA women are
ignorant and malicious; she is a feminist and introduces legislation in
behalf of women, but finds that pro-ERA feminists do not know what the
interests of women are; the interests of women are in a strong home and
strong laws protecting the family in which the man, not the state,
protects the woman; also the federal government in following any kind of
feminist program takes freedom from her directly as a state legislator,
which she finds a violation of states' rights. Another Utah delegate
said she attended the convention because she did not want her tax money
to go to pay for abortion. I asked her about Viet Nam War tax resisters:
they withheld taxes because they did not want their money to pay for the
war; did she withhold taxes to keep her money from paying for abortion?
Yes, she said. Then, as an afterthought, she said that actually she
didn't pay any taxes at all. Did her husband pay them, I asked. She
thought so.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[Sec chapter 1, p. 33, for an explanation of this non

[During the ratification of the resolution supporting homosexual rights,
I sat in the audience. There was yelling and
cheering; ]{.font3}[balloons were let loose through the whole hall when
the resolution was finally ratified after some debate. The scene was one
of wild exhilaration: the thousands of delegates and observers were
celebrating. In the highest balcony I spotted a group of Utah women,
dressed in their black dresses all the same, slowly, grimly exiting.
There were maybe ten of them; they had seen it through to the end; they
were not happy. I raced to the high balcony to talk with them. It was
deserted up there; all the noise was hundreds of feet below us; them and
me.]{.sgc-6}

[They were somber. How did they feel about this, I asked. It was
horrible, the end of everything, the death of the country, an affront to
God; homosexuality was a sin that deserved death, and here women had
voted for it, were clapping and cheering in behalf of it. They were
mortified, ashamed of women, ashamed of the ignorance of women's
libbers. They admitted to never having known any homosexuals; they
admitted that churchgoing men in their own communities were sexually
molesting their own daughters; they admitted that they were surrounded
by men who went to church and were at the same time adulterers. I asked
them why then they were afraid of homosexuals. One woman said, "If you
had a child and he was playing out in the street and a car was coming
you would move him out of the way, wouldn't you? Well, that's all we're
trying to do---get homosexuality away from our children. " I began to
argue that the car coming down the street was more likely to be a
heterosexual male neighbor, or even daddy, than a male homosexual or a
lesbian. One woman stopped being nice. "You're a Jew, " she said, "and
probably a homosexual too. " I found myself slowly being pushed farther
and farther back against the balcony railing. I kept trying to turn
myself around as we talked, to pretend that my position in relation to
the railing and the fall of several hundred feet was not precarious; I
kept talking with them, lowering the threshold of confrontation,
searching my mind for pacifist strategies that would enable me to
maneuver away from the railing by getting them to turn at least slightly
toward it. They kept advancing, pushing me closer and closer to the
railing until my back was arched over it. They kept talking about
homosexuals and Jews. I kept saying pleasant things about how I
respected their religious views; I kept asking them about their own
lives and plans and ideas. They closed in around me. I was completely
isolated up there, and I was getting panicky, they were getting moblike
and intransigent, I kept trying to make myself human for them, they kept
at transforming me into the embodiment of every homosexual Jew in the
hall, the direct cause of their frustration and anger, they kept saying
there was no middle ground and sin had to be wiped out and they hated
sin; and I was deciding that I had better risk breaking through what had
become a menacing gang, breaking away from the railing by pushing them
as hard as I could, knowing that if I didn't make it they would start
beating on me, when two dykes, one of whom I knew well, appeared there
and just stood, watching. I made the religious women aware of the
presence of the lesbian women, just standing, watching; and they moved
away slightly, they moved reluctantly backward. I straightened up, moved
away from that dreadful railing. I kept talking and slowly walked
through the group of them, and the two lesbian feminists and I exited. I
was shaking a lot. The woman I knew said quietly: we saw you up there
and thought you might be in trouble, you just kept getting closer and
closer to that railing, they were crowding you pretty bad, you shouldn't
have been up there alone with them. She was right; but in common with so
many other women I did not take the danger to myself seriously---a
self-deprecating habit. Jew, lesbian, feminist: I knew the hatred was
real, but I had not imagined these apparently docile women hating so
much that with tiny steps they would become a gang: so full of
unexamined hate that they would have pushed me over that railing
"accidentally" in defense of Christianity, the family, and the happily
heterosexual, churchgoing child molester down the block. In my own body,
bent back over that railing, I knew the cold terror of being a
homosexual Jew in a Christian country.]{.font3}

["Anti-Semitism, " wrote Jean-Paul Sartre, "does not fall within the

[passion"^6^]{.font3} [The great hatreds that suffuse history, pushing
it forward to inevitable and repeated horror, are all first passions,

hatred. Hatred of women and hatred of homosexuals are forms of sex
hatred. Race hatred and sex hatred are the erotic obsessions of human
history: passions, not ideas. "If the Jew did not exist, " Sartre wrote,
"the anti-Semite would invent him. "^7^ The carrier of the passion needs

burrows into it, enfolds it, is grafted onto it; the configurations of
oppression emerge.]{.font3}

[In patriarchal history, one passion is necessarily fundamental and
unchanging: the hatred of women. The other passions molt. Racism is a
continuous passion, but the race or races abused change over the face of
the earth and over time. The United States is built on a hatred of
blacks. In Western Europe, the Jew is the primary target. This does not
stop the black from being hated by those who hate Jews first, or the Jew
from being hated by those who hate blacks first. It means instead that
one, and not the other, signifies for the dominant culture its bottom,
its despised, its expendables. Homosexuality is elevated and honored in
some societies, abhorred in others. In societies where hatred of
homosexuality has taken hold, fear of homosexuality is a terrifically
powerful tool in the social manipulation and control of men: pitting
groups of men---all of whom agree that they must be]{.font3}
[men]{.font3}[, higher and better than women---against each other in the
futile quest for unimpeachable masculinity. Hatred of homosexuality
makes possible astonishing varieties of social blackmail and male-male
conflict. In racism, the racially degraded male is sexually stereotyped
in one of two ways. Either he is the rapist, the sexual animal with
intense virility and a huge and potent member; or he is desexualized in
the sense of being demasculinized---he is considered castrated
(unmanned) or he is associated with demeaning (feminizing) and demeaned
(not martial) homosexuality. It is the relationship of the dominant
class to masculinity that determines whether males of the racially
despised group are linked with rape or with castration/homosexuality. If
the dominant group insists that the racially despised male is a rapist,
it means that the dominant males are effeminate by contrast; it is they
who are tinged with homosexuality in that they are less manly. They will
climb the masculinity ladder by killing or maiming those whom they see
as racially inferior but sexually superior. The Nazis transparently
craved masculinity. It was the Jew who had stolen it from them by
stealing the women they should have had. According to Hitler in]{.font3}

[German men unmanned by their own recent history (World War I) and a
host of social and psychological inadequacies, as exemplified in their
leader, found a savage redemption: the annihilation of a racial group of
men perceived as being more male [\*]{.sgc-12}---which, in this setting,
means more animal, less human, not the human husband but the animal
rapist. This annihilation was an act of mass cannibalism by which one
group of men, lacking masculinity, got it from a mountain of corpses and
from the actual killing as well.]{.font3}

.sgc-8} [\[New\* York: Perigee Books, 1981\], p. 147) also exacerbated
the conviction that the racially superior men were not man enough: she
provoked them endlessly with her savage eroticism, but they could not

[In the United States, the black man was characterized as a rapist after
the end of slavery. During slavery, his condition as chattel was seen to
unman him entirely. His degradation was as a symbolically castrated man;
a mule, a beast of burden. (His use as a stud to impregnate black women
slaves to increase the slave wealth of the white master does not
contradict this. ) Vis-a-vis the white man, he was unmanned; and
vis-a-vis the white woman he was unmanned.\* Early in Reconstruction,
May 1866, a fairly optimistic Frederick Douglass wrote that, though
sometimes he feared a genocidal slaughter of blacks by whites, the
movement of the former slaves "to industrial pursuits and the
acquisition of wealth and education"^9^ would lead finally to acceptance
by whites. He recognized that even in success there was danger,]{.font3}

[By 1894, scores of black men had been murdered, lynched, beaten; mob
violence against black men was frenzied and commonplace. "Not a breeze
comes to us from the late rebellious states, " Douglass wrote in "Why Is
The Negro Lynched? " published in a pamphlet in 1894, "that is not
tainted and freighted with Negro blood. "^11^ The white Southerners,
deprived of their unmanned slaves, had found a justification for racist
hatred: the black man--- as part of his racial nature---raped white
women. "It is a charge of recent origin, " wrote Douglass rightly, "a
charge never brought before; a charge never heard of in the time of
slavery or in any other time in our history. "^12^ The end of slavery
unmanned the white slaveowners. It was the former slaves who reminded
them at every turn of that lost manhood, that lost power. It was gone,
someone had taken it; they had been humiliated by the loss of the war
and the loss of their slaves (those who had not owned slaves were still
humiliated by the loss of them). The whites created the black rapist to
reflect what the whites had in fact lost: the right to systematic rape
of women across race lines. The whites created the black rapist to
justify the persecution and killing of black men--- and the literal
castration of individuals to stand in for the symbolic castration of the
whole group under them in slavery, the foundation of their sense of male
power, the material basis of their male power. Rape has been
traditionally viewed as a crime of theft: a woman stolen from a man to
whom she rightfully belongs as wife or daughter. The black rapist was
accused of a crime of theft, only what he stole was not the white woman;
he stole the master's masculinity. The crime had nothing to do with
women---it almost never does. The white men, unmanned, were accusing the
black man of having raped them; the white woman was used as a
figurehead, a buffer, a symbolic carrier of sex, a transmitter of
sex ]{.font3}[man-to-man[\*\*]{.sgc-12}---she almost always is.]{.sgc-6}

[Jewish males have experienced many turns of this homophobic screw. As
the putative killers of Christ, it was hard for the
"turn-the-other-cheek" Christians to take masculinity from them: killing
God is a virile act. But the early Christians did just that. Jews and
homosexuals are linked together in Romans in a propagandistic, highly
evocative way. What has gone wrong? There are lesbians and male
homosexuals, and the Jewish relationship to God through law is not
enough. Lesbians are explicitly named to make the social consequences of
sin clear: the women have become unnatural; they are no longer sexually
submitting to men. The men are not just having sex with each other; they
are unmanly enough to leave the women to each other. Naming lesbians
provides a frame of reference in which one can gauge the loss of
masculinity inherent in the unnatural acts of men. The unnatural acts of
men are seen to lessen the polarization of the sexes. (In a society that
admires male homosexuality, for instance, ancient Greece, these same
acts are seen to heighten that polarization by glorifying maleness and
so serve male supremacy. ) So Paul, in Romans, establishes that
homosexuals--- lesbians named first---are full of malignity and worthy
of death and then goes on to blame the failure of Jews and Jewish law
for all that is most odious in the world---namely, homosexuality
first:]{.font3}

> [And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a

>
> [What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after

> [But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not

[Romans 9: 29-31]{.font3}

[The Jew is even insidiously likened to the Greek, that pederast of
universal fame: "For there is no difference between the Jew and the
Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him"
(Romans 10: 12).]{.font3}

[Then there is circumcision. According to Paul, it no longer signifies
manly connection with God. Paul's denunciation of Jewish law virtually
effeminizes not only the law---ineffectual against sin as it is---but
the Jew, whose carnality could be restrained or governed by it. Paul's
repudiation of Jewish law sounds almost like a sexual boast: "For we
know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin" (Romans
7: 14). Anti-Semitism has been so versatile in so-called Christian
societies because the Christians, nominal or passionate, could exploit
the Jews both as killers of Christ (rapists[\*)]{.sgc-12} or as overt or
covert homosexuals (unmanly, wicked, deceitful, full of strife,
malignity, unnatural; intellectuals tied to the abstract, ineffective
law; smart as men who know the law are and also devious the way men who
know the law are; faithless to God because they engaged in homosexual
acts, because women castrated or effeminized them by being lesbian,
because they socially tolerated homosexuality). Early on, Paul
understood that his pacifist God nailed in exemplary masochistic sexual
passion to a cross had to offer converts masculinity: otherwise,
Christ's suffering would not play in Peoria. The sexual brilliance of
the passion could not hide the morbid femininity of the Jew who suffered
it---willingly, as an act of human will. It was Paul's genius to link
ineffective and effeminate Jewish law and Jews with unnatural
homosexuals worthy of death. It was Paul's genius to exploit Christ as
the prototypical Jew---he suffered like a female, it was his passion, an
ecstasy of agonized penetration---and then to have the resurrection of
Christ symbolize a new nature, a Christian nature: it dies, then rises.
The son, born a Jew, was worthy of death---homosexual as Jews are,
effeminate as Jews are, with their weak law and tenuous masculinity. The
son resurrected triumphed over the father and over death. Those who were
like him, Christians, shared in the victory, got closer to the real God
(the one who won); got more masculine than that Jew who had died in
unspeakable agony on the cross because the resurrected Christ was more
masculine. The crucifixion without the resurrection would have left Jews
and their God the repositories of patriarchal religious authority. The
resurrection turned Jews from patriarchs into pansies, except when it
was more useful to concentrate on them as the killers of Christ. The
simple, cruel, rather monotonous God of the Jews could scarcely compete
with the trebled divinity: The Father, The Son, The Holy Ghost---a
father whose son superseded him in range of affect, emotion, and
bravery, and whose Holy Ghost was purely and ideally phallic and
all-penetrating. It was Paul, back on earth, who established the social
ramifications of this religion of revelation rather than of law for the
Jews who might be queer enough to cling to one god rather than his
trebled usurper: like homosexuals, you are worthy of death.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[The sadism of this deicide establishes a basis for
attributing to the Jews the most vile acts of cruelty, all tinged with
sexual sadism: slaughter of infants to use their blood is a charge that,
with rape, reappears cyclically.]{.sgc-11}

[\*]{.font4 .sgc-1}

[The Old Testament does not contain the bloodlust against homosexuals
and homosexuality found in the New Testament. There is no mention of
lesbians at all. Lesbian acts are inferred to be among the "doings of
Egypt" prohibited in Leviticus. No textual reference to Gomorrah
suggests that it was destroyed because of lesbianism: this too has been
inferred. It is not women who are commanded: "The nakedness of thy
sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother,]{.font3}
[whether she be]{.font3} [born at home, or born abroad,]{.font3}
[even]{.font3} [their nakedness thou shalt not uncover" (Leviticus 18:
9). All of the sexual prohibitions in Leviticus, including the
prohibition against male homosexuality, are rules for effectively
upholding the dominance of a real patriarch, the senior father in a
tribe of fathers and sons. The controlling of male sexuality in the
interests of male dominance---whom men can fuck, when, and how---is the
essential in tribal societies in which authority is exclusively male.
The rules in Leviticus are blueprints for minimizing intratribal sexual
conflict among men. In chapter 18 of Leviticus, incest is broadly
defined and prohibited; adultery, male homosexuality, intercourse with a
menstruating woman, and intercourse with animals are also forbidden. In
chapter 20 of Leviticus, death by stoning is the sentence "for every one
that curseth his father or his mother" (Leviticus 20: 9), for
adulterers, for one who has intercourse with his father's wife or his
daughter-in-law, for male homosexuality, for bestiality. Incest with
one's sister and intercourse with a menstruating woman are not capital
crimes: the punishment is being cut off from one's people. The heinous
crime is not in the sexual act committed per se; it is certainly not in
any abuse of women per se. The heinous crime is in committing a sexual
act that will exacerbate male sexual conflict and provoke permanently
damaging sexual antagonism in the tribe among men. For the Hebrews,
sexual transgression that warranted death had the potential, if widely
practiced, to cause the erosion of the power of men as a class by
creating internecine sexual warfare within the class. The subordination
of women was a means to male social cohesion. The regulation of that
subordination through a regulation of male sexual behavior was
straightforward and eminently practical: men were supposed to sacrifice
some measure of pleasure to maintain power. Incest with one's sister did
not incite male-male conflict so much as did intercourse with one's
daughter-in-law or with the wife of one's father. Therefore, the
punishment was not death by stoning. The prohibitions in Leviticus on
sexual practices are without exception shrewd and pragmatic in these
terms. All of the prohibitions further the aims of male dominance in the
patriarchal tribe and contribute to the stability of male power. This is
true too of the oft quoted prohibition of male homosexuality: "Thou
shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it]{.font3} [is]{.font3}
[abomination" (Leviticus 18: 22). This means simply that it is foul to
do to other men what men habitually, proudly, manfully, do to women: use
them as inanimate, empty, concave things; fuck them into submission;
subordinate them through sex. The abomination is in the meaning of the
act: in a male-supremacist system, men cannot simultaneously be used "as
women" and stay powerful because they are men. The abomination is also,
perhaps most of all, in the consequences of the act in a rigidly
patriarchal tribal society: sexual rivalry among men meant trouble,
feuds, war. The Jews were a tribe perpetually at war with others; they
could not afford war among themselves.\* And from the real
beginning---once outside of Eden---the Jews reckoned with the
anarchistic evil of fratricide: Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau, Joseph
and his brothers---all were tragic stories of brothers torn apart by
jealous conflict over the blessing that showed they were the beloved,
and these struggles to be the best loved had huge historical
consequences for the Jews. Actual carnal sex, the patriarchs recognized,
would have made it worse, not better, intensified the conflict. Sexual
acts among men threatened the social harmony on which the power of men
depended, a social harmony made tenuous enough by the kind of sexual
lust that male ]{.font3}[dominance produces: the lust for forced sex.
Directing that lust toward women, and trying to regulate which women,
made the lust produced by male dominance work in behalf of male
dominance, not against it so that it would collapse of its own sexual
weight. In the Hebrew system, adultery and some other sexual
transgressions of the familial pact were genuinely construed to be as
bad as male homosexuality. There is no special repudiation of male
homosexuality in the laws of Leviticus. There is no special punishment
for it, though the punishment is death. There is no special
characterization of the one who commits the act: he is not different in
kind or degree from those who break other sexual prohibitions and are
judged to deserve death by stoning.]{.sgc-6}

[\* ]{.sgc-6}[A more complex martial society, which the Hebrews became,
could more easily socially tolerate homosexual liaisons, which the
Hebrews apparently did. See discussion of David and Jonathan, p.
134.]{.sgc-11}

[The fact that the Hebrews attributed no special significance to the
prohibition against male homosexuality in Leviticus and had no strictly
sexual repugnance for the act is revealed and underscored by Maimonides'
explication of the law, which will no doubt astonish modern
readers:]{.font3}

> [In the case of a man who lies with a male, or causes a male to have
> connection with him, once sexual contact has been initiated, the rule
> is as follows: If both are adults, they are punishable by stoning, as
> it is said,]{.font3} [Thou shalt not lie with a male]{.font2 .sgc-1}
> [(Lev. 18: 22), i. e. whether he is the active or the passive
> participant in the act. If he is a minor, aged nine years and one day,
> or older, the adult who has connection with him, is punishable by
> stoning, while the minor is exempt.]{.font3} [If]{.font3} [the minor
> is nine years old]{.font2 .sgc-1}[,]{.font2 .sgc-1} [or less]{.font2
> .sgc-1}[,]{.font2 .sgc-1} [both are exempt.]{.font2 .sgc-1} [It
> behooves the court, however, to have the adult flogged for
> disobedience, inasmuch as he has lain with a male, even though with
> one less than nine years of age. ^13^ (Italics mine)]{.font3}

[The Hebrews wanted the perpetuation of male dominance. A male child
under nine did not have male status. Sex with that male child did not
count as a homosexual act. Maimonides takes it on himself to remind the
court that the child is male---though not male ]{.font3}[enough to
warrant the real protection provided by capital punishment as a
deterrent, which is what the death sentence was in the Hebrew system.
The rules governing judgments of guilt were so strict in actual practice
that it is unlikely that capital punishment could have been invoked for
private, consensual sexual acts of any sort. It was the intrusion of sex
into the larger society that concerned the Hebrews. A male child under
nine, at any rate, did not warrant that protection because he was not
yet part of the ruling class of men.]{.sgc-6}

[Similarly, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah shows that it is essential
to male power (to the power of men as a class) to protect men from the
sexual lust of other men---to protect men from forced sex by putting
women in their place. No legal piety interferes with protecting men from
homosexual assault by other men (in the story of Sodom, homosexual gang
rape). The story of Sodom is meant to show that when the simple
mechanical strategy of using women, not men, as targets for
nonconsensual sex breaks down entirely, a patriarchal society will be
destroyed. So God ordains; so the Old Testament describes: and it is an
accurate assessment of the importance of keeping women the objects of
forced sex so that men will not be subjected to it and need not fear
it.]{.font3}

[The story of Sodom and Gomorrah begins with a conversation between God
and Abraham: God says that "\[b\]ecause the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and
see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which
is come unto me; and if not, I will know" (Genesis 18: 20-21). Abraham
asks God if he will destroy Sodom if there are fifty righteous men in
the city. God promises that if there are fifty, he will spare the city.
Abraham, after a few more interchanges, gets God to promise: "I will not
destroy]{.font3} [it]{.font3} [for ten's sake" (Genesis 18: 32). Two
angels go to Sodom, where Lot bows down to them and offers them
hospitality: safety in his home, washing of the feet, unleavened
bread:]{.font3}

> [But before they lay down, the men of the city,]{.font3}
> [even]{.font3} [the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old
> and young, all the people from every quarter:]{.font3}
>
> [And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where]{.font3}
> [are]{.font3} [the men which came in to thee this night? bring them
> out unto us, that we may know them.]{.font3}
>
> [And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
> him.]{.font3}
>
> [And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.]{.font3}
>
> [Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
> pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as]{.font3}
> [is]{.font3} [good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
> therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.]{.font3}

[Genesis 19: 4-8]{.font3}

[The crowd, "both old and young, all the people from every quarter, "
attacked; the angels who appeared as men pulled Lot inside to save him,
and "they smote the men that]{.font3} [were]{.font3} [at the door of the
house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
themselves to find the door" (Genesis 19: 11). The angels told Lot to
leave Sodom because they were going to destroy it. Lot told his
sons-in-law, but they did not believe him. In the morning, the angels
told Lot to take his wife and two unmarried daughters; he lingered, the
angels transported Lot and the women outside the city. God told Lot to
go into the mountains and not to look back; Lot pleaded to be able to go
to a nearby city; God said he would spare that city for Lot's sake:
"Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the
plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon
the ground" (Genesis 19: 24-25). God remembered Lot, and spared him, and
in the wave of destruction of cities, God sent Lot into the mountains,
where Lot lived with his two daughters: "And the firstborn said unto the
younger, Our father]{.font3} [is]{.font3} [old, and]{.font3} [there
is]{.font3} [not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner
of all the earth: Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will
lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father" (Genesis 19:
31-32). On successive nights, each had sex with her drunken father and
both became pregnant. Both had sons, a blessing, and each of those sons
became the father of a whole people, a blessing.]{.font3}

[That the people of Sodom meant the strangers harm is clear. The nature
of that harm is less clear. The demand of the mob to bring the strangers
out "that we may know them" is sexual because the use of "know" usually
is in biblical diction. The attempt of Lot to substitute his virgin
daughters for the men suggests that the mob would have gang-raped the
men. Whether the women in the mob were voyeurs or purveyors of other
forms of violence is impossible to know: and yet the threat to the men
does not seem to be only sexual; it seems to include sexual assault by
men, beating, maiming, and murder. The mixed mob indicates the breakdown
of male class power in the same way that the assault on the male
visitors does: the rules that keep men exercising power as a class over
women as a sexually and socially subject group have broken down
absolutely; that]{.font3} [is]{.font3} [the destruction of the city. The
destruction of Sodom is certainly not for breaking a sexual prohibition
on homosexuality. The daughters who get their father drunk to have
intercourse with him and bear his children also break laws: yet they are
blessed. The lesson is not that the inferred homosexual assault is worse
than the accomplished incest because one is homosexual and the other is
heterosexual. Laws against incest come first in Leviticus and are
repeated or invoked in other parts of the Old Testament. The lesson is
that when men are not safe from other men---a safety that can only be
achieved by keeping women segregated and for sex---the city will be
wiped out. The daughters, in committing incest, broke the law in order
to perpetuate patriarchal power: as a result of what they did, peoples,
tribes, cities, were created. Whatever furthers male dominance, even
when forbidden, will not destroy the city but build it. Sin, in the Old
Testament, is first of all political. Law in the Old Testament is the
regulation of society for the purposes of power, not morality. The Old
Testament is a handbook on sexual politics: the rights of patriarchs and
how to uphold them.]{.font3}

[David perhaps also breaks a sexual prohibition. His love for Jonathan
is indisputable, probably carnal, and goes beyond the abomination of
lying with mankind as with womankind: "I am distressed for thee, my
brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me
was wonderful, passing the love of women" (II Samuel 1: 26). David makes
this declaration of love on learning of Jonathan's death in battle.
Jonathan's father, Saul, also died, and he is remembered in the most
heterosexual of frameworks: "Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who
clothed you in scarlet, with]{.font3} [other]{.font3} [delights, who put
ornaments of gold upon your apparel" (II Samuel 1: 24). The passage on
Jonathan follows the passage on Saul, so the contrast is very marked.
And then there was a lot more war and David became king and time passed;
but still, David's concern was with Jonathan: "Is there yet any that is
left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's
sake? " (II Samuel 9: 1). David found that Jonathan had a son who was
lame and serving another family. David restored all Saul's land to this
son "for Jonathan thy father's sake" (II Samuel 9: 7) and claimed
Jonathan's son as his own: "he shall eat at my table, as one of the
king's sons" (II Samuel 9: 11). There is no sin, no condemnation, no
wrath of God. Like the incest of Lot and his daughters, this union made
Israel stronger, not weaker. The homosexual bond extended the loyalty
and protection of King David to Jonathan's son, the grandson of Israel's
first king, Saul. David, through his love of Jonathan, a love "passing
the love of women, " having survived Jonathan, might be seen as Saul's
logical heir. Hebrew society had become more complex than in the early
tribal days; Saul and David led armies; in a martial society,
homosexuality is often seen to contribute to social cohesion among men.
At least in this period, the Hebrews seem to have viewed it that way;
with David and Jonathan in particular it worked that way; and Israel,
its patriarchy intact (unlike that of Sodom), thrived. The ]{.font3}[God
of the Jews may not have been tolerant, but he was practical.]{.sgc-6}

[There is nothing in the Old Testament to justify the vilification of
homosexuals or homosexuality that began with Paul and still manifests
virulently in the fundamentalist Right in Amerika. It takes the magical
claim that the New Testament is "concealed" in the Old to sustain the
illusion of divine sanction for this special hatred of homosexuality. It
is more than concealed; it is not there. Paul saw the power of the
father in decline. The power of the son was taking its place. The Jews
were confused and divided, and patriarchal power was not effectively
being maintained by Jewish law. Paul worshiped male power; therefore
Paul worshiped the son, was converted to the son's side when he saw the
potential of that side for power. He was opportunistic, politically
brilliant, and a master of propaganda. It was the shrewd Paul who
finally undermined the law that had for centuries kept patriarchal power
intact but now was failing, in decline. He scapegoated homosexuals as
unnatural, deceitful, full of malignity, worthy of death, the source of
intolerable evil; and then he blamed the Jews, and especially the law of
the Jews, for the existence of homosexuality. "Therefore, " Paul
proclaimed in Romans 3: 20, "by the deeds of the law there shall no
flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law]{.font3} [is]{.font3}
[the knowledge of sin. " Paul introduced the hatred of homosexuality
into the Judeo-Christian tradition, and he introduced the hatred of Jews
into it too. In Christian countries, the two groups have suffered
contempt, persecution, and death in each other's shadow ever since; they
have been linked by demagogues seeking power through hate---demagogues
like Paul; trying to pacify the likes of Paul, they have often enough
repudiated and hated each other; and each group has hidden from the
soldiers of Christ in its own way.]{.font3}

[The textual bases for what became the major anti-Semitic charges
against the Jews are in the Gospels. Some Jews were money changers in
the temple, tax collectors, liked money; some Jews plotted to have
Christ killed; some Jews asked Christ tricky legalistic questions to try
to expose him as a poseur or a heretic (claiming to be God violated
Jewish law); it was a crowd of Jews---but not all the Jews---that
demanded the crucifixion of Christ. Jews denied Christ and Jews believed
in Christ. Most Jews may have been the enemy of this new God because
they did not recognize him; but it was Paul who made all Jews into the
enemy of all Christians. The acts against Christ came to represent, as
Paul saw it, the Jewish character; the acts against Christ summed up the
Jews. It is Paul who begins to build institutional Christianity by
destroying the institutions of Judaism; and it is Paul who begins to
build a distinctly Christian character by annihilating the character of
the Jews. The roots of the continuing association of the Jews as a
people with culture, social liberalism (tolerating sin), and
intellectual-ism go back to Paul: he constructed the modern Jew in
history.]{.font3}

[Before the coming of Christ, the law was God's word. The law signified
God's presence on earth and among his people. The law had a divine
significance. The Jews did not consider the law social; for them, one
obeyed because it was written---obedience was faith. The coming of
Christ meant that God's will was embodied in a person: son of man. In
Paul's interpretation, the law became a body of dogma that interfered
with faith. It became cultural, not sacred. It was the legalism of the
Jews, their intellection, their pedantry, that kept them in sin, kept
them from recognizing the Christ: in practical terms, the law became the
symbol of Jewish resistance to this personal God, this God whom Paul
knew---unlike Abraham, Moses, or David. Paul could speak in behalf of
this new God, and any adherence to law that challenged Paul's authority
was wickedness. The law of the Jews, the intellect of the Jews, and the
culture of the Jews in fact were the enemies of Paul's authority as one,
simply, who knew Christ.]{.font3}

[In undermining the authority of Jewish law, Paul over and over linked
that law to sin, especially to homosexuality. It was the social
tolerance of the Jews for homosexuality in private that proved the
corruption of Jewish law. It was the lack of masculinity implicit in
this tolerance that lost the Jews physical circumcision as their mark of
supreme manhood; spiritual circumcision, the kind that would not
tolerate homosexuality, became the proof of manhood.]{.font3}

[Paul named the Jews the enemy of Christ, of Christianity, and of Paul.
He emphasized the Jewish character, which he invented: legalistic,
intellectual, socially tolerant of sin, intellectually arrogant in
putting law over revelation and faith, lost to Christ through
intellection and abstraction and legalism and social liberalism, having
a false relationship to God (no longer God's people). Paul was not
talking about some Jews who did this and some Jews who did that; Paul
was talking about]{.font3} [the]{.font3} [Jews.]{.font3}

[It was especially important for Paul, in getting power, to change the
perception of what Jewish law was and how it functioned. Turning
something holy, from God, into something cultural, the work of a group
of corrupt men, is to turn the absolute into the relative. Anything
cultural can be changed or abandoned or manipulated. The people whose
law begins to represent culture, not divinity, are more imperiled than
they were because their status depends on the status of culture in
general in any given society: the infamous "Whenever I hear the word
'culture' I reach for my gun" denotes how low the status of culture can
be with obvious consequences to those who represent it. Also, unless the
law is made concrete because people obey it, it is abstract: and the
abstraction of Jewish law became, in Paul's rhetoric, a major synonym
for sin; in a sense, concentrating on the abstraction of the law
literally turned intellection (more abstraction) into sin. What was not
faith in Christ was Jewish stuff: abstract laws, tolerance of sin, law
and writing and thinking as cultural diversions from the true faith.
What does it mean that Paul especially concentrates on the sin of
homosexuality in relation to the Jews and their law: the homosexual
Greeks were at the pinnacle of culture five centuries before the birth
of Christ---reading, writing, and ideas were their domain; Paul passed
the mantle of high culture to the Jews after the demise of Greek
culture---law substituted for both dialogue and tragedy. Culture,
through Paul's agency, came to mean both homosexuals (the Greek
heritage) and Jews (the law as a basis for culture). For hundreds of
centuries, believing Christians have committed mass murders, pogroms,
vast persecutions, crafted and enforced systems of civil and religious
law so vicious and discriminatory that Jews have been prohibited from
owning land, denied citizenship and all manner of civil rights, and even
been defined as subhuman: sexual intercourse with them has been regarded
as a form of bestiality. In at least two genocides of indescribable
cruelty, both Jews and homosexuals were searched for, found, and killed:
the Inquisition and the Holocaust.]{.font3}

[The suffering of the Jews, the seemingly endless attempt to purge the
Jew from history and from society by driving him out or exterminating
him, has not made the Jews good. Jews remain human, to the astonishment
of everyone, including Jews. But even more shocking to Christians is the
undeniable fact that persecution has not made Jews into Christians. As
one liberal Christian leader said on Sunday-morning television: we
thought the Jews would wither away; we have to face the fact that the
Jews are still with us and that even after the Holocaust there are still
Jews who cling to their identity as Jews; those of us who thought that
conversion was the answer to the Jewish problem have to face the fact
that we were wrong; we are going to have accept the fact that these are
God's people in a very special sense---they cannot be wiped out, as
recent history has shown, as our attempts to convert them have
shown.]{.font3}

[Not being Christian in a world that hates the Jew, the homosexual, the
castrated male, haunts the post-Holocaust Jew: he has seen the future
and it is annihilation. Especially the contemporary Jew is fighting for
his masculinity. In the camps Jewish men were castrated: some, only
some. The castration was literal for individuals; two thirds of the
world's Jewry was exterminated, which castrates the people as a whole
rather effectively. Nothing threatens the Jewish male now more than a
perception of him as being deficient in masculinity. For this reason,
Israel is a militarist nation: no one will ever again accuse the Jews of
being soft. For this reason, Amerikan Jewish writers are apostles of
machismo and pimp masculinity. And for this reason, there is a growing
segment of the Amerikan Jewish population that is part of the Christian
evangelical Right.]{.font3}

[First, there is the trade-off. On television, a rabbi and a priest were
talking. The priest said: we feel about abortion the way you feel about
Israel. I think we can talk, said the rabbi. It is in the interests of
male Jews (the power structure) to increase the population of Jews. The
trade-off---abortion for Israel---is in the interests of Jews both for
the sake of Israel and for the sake of rebuilding a Jewish population in
the easiest way---through male domination.]{.font3}

[Second, there is the effort to dissociate the Jewish men from any
perception of femininity, being less masculine. Israel, of course, makes
Jews more male: owning land, controlling a state, having a nation,
having an army, having borders to defend and to transgress. In
associating with the Christian Right, there is a repudiation of
homosexuality, liberal social tolerance of it (still blamed on Jews), a
strong move against women (reestablishing male dominance), and in
general making an alliance with the rulers---with
the ]{.font3}[Christians who run a Christian country.]{.sgc-6}

[Third, there is the fact that suffering has not made Jews good, which
means that there are greedy Jews who think that power means safety and
also who take pleasure in power. The Christian Right offers Jews not
only a means of dissociation from homosexuality but also real dominance
over women, if the social order the Christians want is effectively
legislated.]{.font3}

[Fourth, there is the fact that suffering has not made Jews good, which
means that there are Jews who hate homosexuals, women, blacks, children,
reading, writing, air, trees, and everything else the Christian Right
seems to hate.]{.font3}

[Fifth, the right-wing emphasis on the importance of property offers
Jews a way of changing the history of Jews with respect to
property---whether the property is Israel or land or housing or
factories or farms. The protection of property suggests to Jews that
they will not be driven off what they own.]{.font3}

[Sixth, religious conservatism has its analogue in social conservatism,
in that both particularly uphold the rights of men to ownership of women
and children. Right-wing Jews who are religiously orthodox see the
secular pluralism of Western society in general and the United States in
particular as taking Jews away from Judaism: this, despite the emphasis
that Judaism puts on learning, makes them hostile to secular learning,
secular intellectuals, secular Jews, any education that is not strictly
and explicitly Jewish. This brings them into a harmony of values with
Christians who do not like Jews because Jews represent learning: the
right-wing Jews are under the illusion that they and the Christian Right
dislike the same Jews for similar reasons.]{.font3}

[Seventh, strangely enough it is in this quasi-religious coalition with
the Christian Right that right-wing Jews seek to find the assimilation
that has always been the hope of Jews. We feel the same way you do, they
say; we have the same values you have, the same ideals, the same goals,
and we are doing our share. It has been brilliant strategy on the part
of the Christian Right in the United States to welcome the participation
of Jews, to support the state of Israel, and to use pedestal
anti-Semitism: rather than being ground under stomping boots, Jews loyal
in their right-wing values are being lifted up onto a pedestal---where
the footing is always precarious, as women know. Believing they can fit
in---assimilate ---these Jews are turning to the one group of
people---the fundamentalists---who will never forget that "the Jews
killed Christ. " Anything not to be that castrate, that homosexual;
there is more dignity in the killing of Christ than in the concentration
camps when the measure is masculinity.]{.font3}

[In the contemporary world, Jews have an extra burden as creators of
culture: Freud and Marx were Jews. The ideas of both are repugnant to
the Christian Right. Freud, right or wrong, made sex a central social
issue. Marx brought half the world to revolution. It is Marx that the
United States government and the Christian Right are fighting; armies
are raised and missiles are built to do it. It is Freud who asked why
the family works the way it does and suggested that the family was a
sexual unit. The intellectual Jew Freud had ideas that undermined what
the Christian Right regards as the cornerstone of Amerikan life: the
family. The real question, of course, was not about the family as such
but about the paterfamilias: who is daddy having sex with and why? Freud
refused to ask that question finally; but perhaps it would not have ever
been asked, or no one would be asking it now, if Freud had not dissected
the sexual underbelly of the family with his formidable
intellect.]{.font3}

[Right-wing Jews have a special stake in repudiating the ideas of both
Freud and Marx. Ideas are sissifying, and Jews need masculinity. The
ideas of these two Jewish intellectuals are dangerous: dangerous because
right-wing Christianity hates them, therefore dangerous to Jews who do
not want to be hated. Jews are cultural radicals and political
revolutionaries by contamination. It's the damn Jews, a Klan member will
say; and even he will mean Freud and Marx. \* Ideas, however potent, do
not serve to masculinize Jews. Ideas only make Jews more Jewish: more
effeminate as intellectuals.]{.font3}

[In the end, Jewish men join up with the Christian Right because they
want domination over women and children, which is the social program of
the Right; and because they want to be the opposite of homosexual,
whatever that is.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[Charles Darwin, whose ideas are as radical and as central
to the contemporary epoch as are Freud's and Marx's, was not a Jew, but
never mind. Lyndon LaRouche, the leader of a neo-Nazi movement that is
getting powerful in the United States, claims that "the Zionist evil" is
one of the "key arms of the British intelligence body which is behind
the operation to destroy America" and that the Anti-Defamation League is
"literally the Gestapo of the British secret intelligence" in the United
States. In the propaganda of Lyndon LaRouche, who has been behind such
diverse groups as the U. S. Labor Party, the Fusion Energy Foundation,
the National Democratic Policy Committee, and the National Anti-Drug
Coalition, "British" is virtually a synonym for "Jewish. " (See "Lyndon
LaRouche's Goon Squads, " Alan Crawford,]{.font2 .sgc-1

"Creationism" (God created the world in seven days, there was no
evolution) is a main tenet of the orthodox (not neo-Nazi) Right; the
ideas of Darwin are as despised as the ideas of Freud and Marx.]{.font2

[Within the frame of male domination, there is good reason for women to

or right-wing or fundamentalist or orthodox Christianity; and within the
frame of male domination, there is good reason for women to hate
homosexuality, both male and female.]{.font3}

[Women are interchangeable as sex objects; women are slightly less
disposable as mothers. The only dignity and value women get is as
mothers: it is a compromised dignity and a low value, but it is all that
is offered to women as women. Having children is the best thing women
can do to get respect and be assured a place. The fact that having
children does not get women respect or a place is almost beside the
point: poor women don't get respect and live in dung heaps; black women
don't get respect and are jailed in decimated ghettos; just plain
pregnant women don't get respect and the place they have is a dangerous
one---pregnancy is now considered a]{.font3} [cause]{.font3} [of battery
(stress on the male, don't you know): in perhaps 25 percent of families
in which battery occurs, it is a pregnant woman who has been battered.
In fact, having children may mean both increased violence and increased
dependence; it may significantly worsen the economic circumstances of a
woman or a family; it may hurt a woman's health or jeopardize her in a
host of other ways; but having children is the one social contribution
credited to women---it is the bedrock of women's social worth. Despite
all the happy smiling public mommies, the private mommies have grim
private recognitions. One perception is particularly chilling: without
the children, I am not worth much. The recognition is actually more
dramatic than that, much more chilling: without the children, I am not.
Right-wing Judaism and right-wing Christianity both guarantee that women
will continue to have a place outside history but inside the home:
through childbearing. Without that, women know they have nothing.
Homosexuality for women means having nothing; it means extinction. Well,
who's going to have the babies? men ask when faced with women surgeons
and politicians---as if the question had an intrinsic logic; or as if
ending war were not logically a part of having "enough" people. "All
this talk, for and against and about babies, " wrote Charlotte Perkins
Gilman, "is by men. One would think the men bore the babies, nursed the
babies, reared the babies\.... The women bear and rear the children. The
men kill them. Then they say: 'We are running short of children---make
some more. '"^14^ The extinction women fear is not this extinction men
conjure up: who will make the babies so that we can fight our wars? It
is the extinction of women: women's function and with it women's worth.
Men have one reason for keeping women alive: to bear babies. The sex of
domination leads to death: it is the killing of body and
will---conquest, possession, annihilation; sex, violence, death---that
is pure sex; and it is the slow annihilation of the woman's will that is
eros, and the slow annihilation of her body that is eros; her violation
is sex, whether it ends in her aesthetic disappearance into oblivion or
her body bludgeoned in a newspaper photograph or the living husk used
and discarded as sexual garbage. Annihilation is sexy, and sex tends
toward it; women are the preferred victims of record. Only having
children moderates men's sexual usage of women: use them up and throw
them away, fuck them to death, killing them softly. If women are not
needed to run the country or write the books or make the music or to
farm or engineer or dig coal or fix plumbing or cure the sick or plav
basketball, what are women needed for? If the absence of women from all
these areas, from all areas, is not perceived as loss, emptiness,
poverty, what are women for? Right-wing women have faced the answer.
Women are for fucking and having children. Fucking gets you dead, unless
you have children too. Homosexuality---its rise in public visibility,
attempts to socially legitimize or protect it, a sense that it is
attractive and on the move and winning not only acceptance but
practitioners---makes women expendable: the one thing women can do and
be valued for will no longer be valued, cannot be counted on to be that
bedrock of women's worth. This is true of both lesbianism and male
homosexuality, in that both negate women's reproductive value to men;
but male homosexuality is especially terrifying because it suggests a
world without women altogether---a world in which women are extinct.
"\[I\]n sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, " God cursed Adam's
woman (Genesis 3: 16)---she is referred to as "the woman" until she and
Adam are expelled from Eden and Adam names her ]{.font3}[Eve "because
she was the mother of all living" (Genesis 3: 20). On expulsion from
Eden man knew sex leading to death; and woman knew childbearing in
sorrow and pain, on which her well-being, such as it is, still depends.
The sorrow was apparently avoided altogether by Phyllis Schlafly, who
waxes euphoric on having children: "None of those measures of career
success \[traveling to "exciting faraway places, " having authority over
others, winning, or earning a fortune\] can compare with the thrill, the
satisfaction, and the fun of having and caring for babies, and watching
them respond and grow under a mother's loving care. More babies multiply
a woman's joy. "^15^ The thrill, the endlessly multiplying joy, was not
in God's original intention; and indeed, it is unlikely that Schlafly
has outwilled him. In the sorrow of having children there is the
recognition that one's humanity is reduced to this, and on this one's
survival depends. Being a woman is this, or it is unspeakably worse than
this. Homosexuality brings up for women the barrenness of not even
having this. A woman has committed her life to bringing forth children
in order to have a life of dignity and worth; she has found the one way
in which she is absolutely necessary; and then, that is gone as an
absolute. It must be an absolute, because there are women who stake
their lives on it as an absolute; it is certainly what women have had to
count on. Everything that women have to gain from homosexuality---and
women have a great deal to gain from it: less forced penetration of
themselves, for instance---is obliterated by the fear of losing what
value women have, a fear conjured up by homosexuality in women whose own
right to life is in having children. Despite all the happy talk of the
total women, there is a fierce anxiety there: if men did not need
babies, and women to have them, these bright wives would be shivering on
street corners like the other fast fucks. Her womb is her wealth; her
use in childbearing is his strongest tie to her; she holds his \[sic\]
children, actual and potential, hostage, for her own sake. It is not
rational to hate homosexuals because they force one to experience a
terror of extinction: the cold chill of being useless, unnecessary,
expendable. But passions are distinguished by their illogic: one can
describe them and find an interior logic in them up to a point---then
there is a sensational leap into hate, dazzling, crazed, obsessional.
Homophobia, like anti-Semitism, is not an idea; it is a passion. For
women, hatred of homosexuals--- despised because they are associated
with women---is more than self-defeating; it is almost breathtakingly
suicidal, encouraging as it does the continuing hatred of anything or
anyone associated with women. But the perception that having children is
the only edge women have on survival at the hands of men is right; it is
an acute perception, grounded in an accurate reading of what women are
for and how women are used by men in this sexual system. Without
reproduction, women as a class have nothing. In sorrow or not, bearing
babies is what women can do that men need---really need, no handjob can
substitute here; and homosexuality makes women afraid, irrationally,
passionately afraid, of extinction: of being unnecessary as a class, as
women, to men who destroy whatever they do not need and whose impulses
toward women are murderous anyway.]{.sgc-6}

[In]{.font3} [A Room of One\'s Own]{.font3}[, first read as a paper in
1928, the prescient Virginia Woolf called the attention of the women in
her audience to a statement by a popular British journalist of the time
who warned "that when children cease to be altogether desirable, women
cease to be altogether necessary. "^1^ The woman who is deviant because
she has no children, as Woolf was even in her avant-garde set, is often
aware of how tenuous her existence is: it is a courtesy extended to
her---letting her go on---despite the fact that she is not earning her
womanly keep in the womanly way. She knows how little the world at large
needs her or values her for anything else she does even when she is
exceptional; and if she understands how systematic and relentless the
valuation of her kind is, she also knows that at the heart of the male
system there is a profound contempt for anything in women that is
individual, that is independent of the class definition or function,
that cannot finally be perceived and justified as incidental to
motherhood.]{.font3}

[Had anyone thought seriously about how women "cease to be altogether
necessary, " they might have thought in terms of population control:
there are too many people; governments decide to feed all the people,
which provides a certain incentive for finding ways to see that there
are less people; this is presented to the people as a humanistic program
to increase the quality of life for a smaller, less burdensome, less
troubled population; the women who were giving birth to the teeming
masses are not altogether necessary anymore. There is lots of liberal
hope and goodwill. The Right has reason to be pleased too, since society
operates largely according to its conception of value: poor, black,
Hispanic, and immigrant populations would inevitably be the targets of
state-run population-control programs; the teeming masses, so messy, so
poor, so dark, would disappear, or significantly diminish in numbers,
taking with them the poverty for which their color seems responsible.
Get rid of those dirty beggars in India. Get rid of the bastards those
black women on welfare keep producing. Get rid of the Jews too, the old
and sick, the Gypsies, the homosexuals, the political dissidents---as
the Nazis did, often in the name of creating a better-quality
population. But the Nazis did not just kill to get rid of the population
garbage. They had a program of breeding. Himmler developed a plan for a
Women's Academy of Wisdom and Culture: it would give a degree called
"Exalted Woman. " Birth control advertising was forbidden; birth control
clinics were shut down; abortions were forbidden and the Nazis were
fierce enforcers of antiabortion laws; all so that Aryan women would
breed. In 1934, the Nazis established the Mother Service Department. Its
purpose was to educate women over eighteen to fulfill the duties of
womanhood Nazi-style. "The program of our Nationalist Socialist woman's
movement contains really only one single point, " said Hitler in 1934.
"This point is the child that must come into being and that must thrive.
"^2^ Fiancees of S. S. men had to take the training offered by the
Mother Service Department. Pure German women were encouraged to bear the
children of S. S. men and were sup]{.font3}[ported by the Nazi state.
Himmler established homes for these women. No abortion, no birth
control, no careers other than motherhood for the racially pure;
imprisonment, rape, sometimes sterilization, and death for the others.
The racially privileged woman is not free; the conditions of her
survival are predetermined; she may get rewards for meeting them but
outside of them she has no chance. While the racially inferior women are
being used one way, the racially superior women are being used in what
appears to be an opposite way: but it is not. These are two sides of the
same coin. The two sides travel together, materially inseparable and yet
unalterably divided. Neither side, in this case, has a life outside
totalitarian womanhood. In such a society, the racially privileged woman
has the best deal; but she is not free. Freedom is something different
from the best deal---even for women.]{.sgc-5}

[State-run population programs always have the racist tinge and are
sometimes explicitly and murderously racist. Population-control programs
run by any state or state-controlled agency or beholden to any male
interest or clique are very different from the ideology and practice of
reproductive freedom. Reproductive freedom has as its basic premise the
notion that every individual woman must control her own reproductive
destiny. She has a right to be protected from state intrusion and from
male intrusion: she has a right to determine her own reproductive life.
Abortion on demand, for instance, is at the will of the pregnant woman;
sterilization of poor women is usually at the will of the male doctor
who represents his race and class and is often paid by the state or acts
in accordance with the interests of the state. Sterilization abuse in
the United States has been practiced primarily on very poor black and
Hispanic women. Contraceptives are tested on the women in Puerto Rico,
which has the virtue of being a U. S. colony as well as having a
brown-skinned population. Contraceptive drugs known to be highly toxic
are tested systematically on women in the Third World with that
astonishingly familiar misogynist justification--- "They want it. " The
evidence of this collective will is that the women line up for
injections of such drugs. It is frequently not mentioned that a chicken
or other food is payment for taking the shot, and the women are starving
and so are their children. Those who have seen institutionalized
programs of population control as a humane and sensible solution to some
aspects of mass poverty have been unable to face the problem intrinsic
to these programs: the poor are often also not white, and the enthusiasm
of state planners for population control is often based on this fact.
Children of these women long ago ceased to be altogether desirable; and
these women long ago ceased to be altogether necessary.]{.font3}

[The marginality of these masses of women because of race has obscured
how much their expendability has to do with being women. "Made in South
America Where Life Is Cheap" read the advertisements for the
pornographic film]{.font3} [Snuff,]{.font3} [which purported to show the
torture, maiming, and murder of a woman for the purposes of sexual
entertainment: the removing of the woman's uterus from her slit abdomen
was the sexual act to which the man in the film who was doing the
cutting supposedly climaxed. Life is cheap for both women and men
wherever life is cheap, and life is cheap wherever people are poor. But
for women, life is in the uterus; and the well-being of
women---economic, social, sexual---depends on what the value of the
uterus is, how it will be used and by whom, whether or not it will be
protected and why. Whatever her race or class---however much she is
privileged or hated for one or both---a woman is reducible to her
uterus. This is the essence of her political condition as a woman. If
she is childless, she is not worth much to anyone; if her children are
less than desirable, she is less than necessary. On a global scale,
racist population programs already exist that provide the means and the
ideological justifications for making masses of women extinct because
their children are not wanted. The United States, a young, virile
imperialist power compared to its European precursors, has pioneered
this kind of reproductive imperialism. The United States was the perfect
nation to do so, since the programs depend so much on science and
technology (the nation's pride) and also on a most distinctive
recognition of precisely how expendable women are as women, simply
because they are women. Obsessed with sex as a nation, the United States
knows the strategic importance of the uterus, abroad and at
home.]{.font3}

[Inside the United States, gynocidal polices are increasingly
discernible. The old, the poor, the hungry, the drugged, the mentally
ill, the prostituted, those institutionalized in wretchedly inhumane
nursing homes and mental hospitals, are overwhelmingly women. In a
sense, the United States is in the forefront of developing a
postindustrial, post-Nazi social policy based on the expendability of
any group in which women predominate and are not valued for reproduction
(or potential reproduction in the case of children). Public policy in
the United States increasingly promises to protect middle-class or rich
white women owned in marriage who reproduce and to punish all other
women. The Family Protection Act---a labyrinthian piece of federal
legislation designed to give police-state protection to the male-headed,
male-dominated, female-submissive family---and the Human Life Amendment,
which would give a fertilized egg legal rights adult women are still
without, would be the most significant and effective bludgeoning
instruments of this public policy if passed. Along with already actual
cutbacks in Social Security, Medicaid, and food programs, these laws are
intended to keep select women having babies and to destroy women who are
too old to reproduce, too poor or too black or brown to be valued for
reproducing, or too queer to pass. This, in conjunction with the
flourishing pornography industry in which women are sexually consumed
and then shit out and left to collect flies, suggests that women will
have to conform slavishly to right-wing moral codes to survive; and
that, too poor or too old, a woman's politics or philosophy however
traditionally moral will not make her life a whit more valuable. The use
the state wants to make of a woman's uterus already largely
determines---and will more effectively determine in the future---whether
she is fed or starved, genuinely sheltered or housed in squalor, taken
care of or left in misery to pass cold, hungry, neglected days.]{.font3}

[The association of women with old age and poverty predates the
contemporary Amerikan situation, in which women are the bulk of both the
old and the poor. In 1867, Jean Martin Charcot, known primarily for his
work with the institutionalized insane, did a systematic study of old
age. The population he studied was old women in a public hospital in
Paris---female, old, poor, urban. Since that time, many psychological
and sociological generalizations about the old have been framed as if
the population under discussion were male, even when it was exclusively
female as in Charcot's study. Many observations about the old were made
by professional men about poor women. As if to signal both the symbolic
and actual relationship between old age and women, the first person in
the United States to receive a Social Security check after the passage
of the Social Security Act in 1935 was a woman, Ida M. Fuller. Now in
the United States, when there is no doubt whatsoever that the old are
primarily female, that the poor are primarily female, that those on
welfare are primarily female, that those in nursing homes are primarily
female, that those in mental institutions are primarily female, there is
still no recognition that the condition of poverty is significantly
related to the condition of women; or that the status of old people, for
instance, is what it is because the bulk of the old are women. "Indeed,
" writes one writer on old age, "relatively recent trends in the aging
of America may have changed the status of older Americans. It is
conceivable, for instance, that the elderly have become a much larger
burden to society since World War I. After all, women, very old persons,
and those 'stuck' in deteriorating locations now constitute a greater
proportion of the aged population than ever before. "^3^ Women, very old
persons, and those "stuck" in deteriorating locations: women, women, and
women. "After all, " women, women, and women "now constitute a greater
proportion of the aged population than ever before"---the status of the
old has changed, gone down; ]{.font3}[they are more of a burden; "after
all, " they are women. In 1930, there were more men over sixty-five than
women; by 1940, there were more women. In 1970, there were 100 women to
72 men over sixty-five. In 1990, for every 100 women there will "only"
be 68 men (as the experts put it). The situation is getting worse:
because the more women there are, the fewer men, the worse the situation
gets. Old women do not have babies; they have outlived their husbands;
there is no reason to value them. They live in poverty because the
society that has no use for them has sentenced them to death. Their
tenacity in holding on to life is held against them. Cuts in Social
Security and food programs for the old directly issue from the
willingness of the U. S. government to watch useless females go hungry,
live in viciously degrading poverty, and die in squalor. On the
television news, social workers tell us several times a week that old
people are going hungry: "they have just enough food to keep them alive,
" one said, "but they never eat enough to stop them from being hungry. "
Then we see the interviews with old people, the cafeterias where old
people who can walk go to get their one meal of the day. They are mostly
women. They say they are hungry. We can observe, if we care to, that
they are female and hungry.]{.sgc-5}

[Within this population of the old, there are the people in nursing
homes. "There are more than 17, 000 nursing homes in the United
States---as opposed to roughly 7, 000 general hospitals---and their
aggregate revenues exceed \$12 billion a year, " writes Bruce C. Vladeck
in]{.font3} [Unloving Care: The Nursing Home Tragedy.]{.font3} ["They
have been described as 'Houses of Death, ' 'concentration camps, '
'warehouses for the dying. ' It is a documented fact that nursing home
residents tend to deteriorate, physically and psychologically, after
being placed in what are presumably therapeutic institutions. The
overuse of potent medications in nursing homes is a scandal in itself.
Thousands of facilities in every state of the nation fail to meet
minimal government standards of sanitation, staffing, or patient care.
The best governmental estimate is that roughly half the nation's nursing
homes are 'substandard. '"^4^ In 1978, according to Vladeck, there were
still nursing homes "with green meat and maggots in the kitchen,
narcotics in unlocked cabinets, and disconnected sprinklers in
nonfire-resistant structures. "^5^ Over 72 percent of the nursing home
population is female. Women in nursing homes are generally widows or
never married, white, poorer than most of their peers (70 percent having
incomes under \$3000 a year consisting mainly of Social Security
benefits), and have several chronic diseases. According to]{.font3} [The
New York Times]{.font3} [(October 14, 1979), the average age of the
person in such an institution is 82 and 50 percent have no family, get
no visitors, and are supported by government money. Conditions are most
terrible in nursing homes supported by government funding of patient
care: nursing homes for the destitute, for those on Medicaid. The policy
of the United States government is that old people must become paupers:
\* spend any money of their own that they have, after which the
government takes over; the paupers are unable to defend themselves
against the conditions in the homes in which they are kept. Once
paupers, they must accept confinement on the state's terms because they
have no money and nowhere to go. The state's terms all too frequently
are neglect, degradation, filth, and not infrequently outright
sadism.]{.font3}

Dubrovsky,]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10} [The New York Times]{.font2 .sgc-1
.sgc-10}[, October 21, 1979. In a subsection called "How the Programs
Work, " Dubrovsky explains:]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10}]{.sgc-8}

["As of April 1977, the last period for which such figures were
available, a nursing-home patient under Medicaid could not have an
income greater than \$533. 39 a month. However, should this same person
want to remain at home and receive community-based health-related
services, his monthly income must be less than \$200.]{.font2 .sgc-1

["Thus, Medicaid laws are biased in favor of institutional care.]{.font2

a single person or \$2, 500 for a couple.]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10}

["To be accepted by a nursing home under Medicaid, a person must sell
his home, liquidate his assets and turn them over to Medicaid as a gift,
in which case he stays on Medicaid.]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10}

["Or, he may give the funds directly to the nursing home as a private
payment until the money falls below the allowable level. When that
happens, the patient reapplies for Medicaid, but may be put on a waiting
list.\"]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10}

[The nursing home population is markedly white. Blacks die younger than
whites in the United States---perhaps the result of systematic racism,
which means inadequate health care, shelter, and money over a lifetime.
Blacks alone comprise a full 11. 8 percent of the U. S. population and
yet only 9 percent of the old are people of color, including Asians,
Native Americans, and His-panics. Nationally, so-called nonwhites
(including blacks) comprise only 5 percent of the nursing home
population. In New Jersey, for instance, according to]{.font3} [The New
York Times]{.font3} [(October 21, 1979), out of 8, 683 beds in eighty
nursing homes, blacks occupied 532 and Hispanics or "others" occupied 38
(6. 5 percent). It seems that blacks especially are left to suffer the
diseases of old age on their own and to die on their own; and that
whites are institutionally maintained in appalling conditions---kept
alive but barely. If this is true, the social function of nursing homes
becomes clearer: out of sight, out of mind. Blacks are already invisible
in ghettos---young, middle-aged, old. Black women have been socially
segregated and marginalized all their lives. Perceptions of their
suffering are easily avoided by an already callous white-supremacist
populace, the so-called mainstream. It is white women who have become
poor and extraneous with old age; they are taken from mainstream
communities where they are useless and dumped in nursing homes. It is
important to keep them away from those eager, young, middle-class white
women who might be demoralized at what is in store for them once they
cease to be useful. Kept in institutions until they die as a punishment
for having lived so long, for having outlived their sex-appropriate
work, old white women find themselves drugged (6. I prescriptions for an
average patient, more than half the patients given drugs like Thorazine
and Mellaril); sick from neglect with bedsores, urinary, eye, and ear
infections; left lying in their own filth, tied into so-called geriatric
chairs or tied into bed; sometimes not fed, not given heat, not given
any nursing care; sometimes left in burning baths (from which there have
been drownings); sometimes beaten and left with broken bones. Even in
old age, a woman had better have a man to protect her. She has earned no
place in society on her own. With a man, she will most likely not end up
in a prison for the female old. She has more social value if she has a
man, no matter how old she is---and she will also have more money. After
a lifetime of systematic economic discrimination---no pay for
housekeeping, lower pay for salaried work, lower Social Security
benefits, often with no rights to her husband's pension or other
benefits even after decades of marriage if he has left her---a woman
alone is virtually resourceless. The euphemistically named "displaced
homemaker" foreshadows the old woman who is put away.]{.font3}

[The drugging of the predominantly female nursing home population
continues in old age a pattern established with awful frequency among
women: women get 60 to 80 percent of the prescriptions for mood-altering
drugs (60 percent of the prescriptions for barbiturates, 67 percent for
tranquilizers, and 80 percent for amphetamines). Women are prescribed
more than twice the drugs that men are for the same psychological
conditions. One study of women in Utah, cited by Muriel Nellis
in]{.font3} [The Female Fix]{.font3}[, "showed that 69 percent of women
over the age of thirty-four who were not employed outside the home and
who were members in good standing of the Mormon Church use minor
tranquilizers. "^6^ Such women are considered a high-risk group for
addiction by the time they are forty-five or fifty.]{.font3}

[The dimensions of female drug addiction and dependency are staggering.
In 1977, 36 million women used tranquilizers; 16 million, sleeping
pills; 12 million, amphetamines; and nearly 12 million women got
prescriptions for these drugs from doctors for the first time. As
Nellis, who cites these figures,\* makes clear:]{.font3}

> [Those numbers do not include whole classes of prescribed pain
> killers, all of which are mood altering and addictive. Nor do they
> include the billions of doses dispensed to patients directly, without
> a prescription, in doctors' offices, in military, public, or private
> hospitals, and in clinics or nursing homes. ^7^]{.font3}

[According to the Food and Drug Administration, between 1977 and 1980
Valium was the most prescribed drug in the United States.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.sgc-12}[Testimony in 1978 by the acting director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse before the House Select Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control.]{.sgc-2}

[At best it can be said that the woman's lot in life, the female role,
necessitates a lot of medical intervention in the form of mood-altering
drugs. At worst it must be said that these drugs are prescribed to women
because they are women---and because the doctors are largely men. The
male doctor's perception of the female patient, conditioned by his
belief in his own difference from her and superiority to her, is that
she is very emotional, very upset, irrational, has no sense of
proportion, cannot discern what is trivial and what is important. She
has no credibility as an observer of her own condition or even as one
who can report subjective sensations or feelings with any integrity or
acuity. She is overwrought not because of any objective condition in her
life but because she is a woman and women get emotional and overwrought
simply because that is how women are. Doctors have prescribed
tranquilizers to women for menstrual cramps, which have a physiological
cause; for battery---the battered woman is handed a prescription and
sent home to the batterer; for pregnancy---a woman is chemically helped
to accept an unwanted pregnancy; for many physiologically rooted
diseases that the doctor does not care to investigate (but he would
examine a man carefully, not give a tranquilizer); and for physiological
and psychological conditions that result from stress caused by
environmental, political, social, or economic factors. When a man and a
woman go to doctors complaining of the same symptoms, she is dismissed
or handed a tranquilizer and he is examined and given tests.]{.font3}
[Hysteria]{.font3} [means suffering of the womb. Since antiquity it has
denoted biological womanhood. Freud is credited by some sentimentalists
as a feminist because he insisted that men could be genuinely hysterical
too. He was the first to assert that hysteria could manifest in someone
without a womb. This was very liberal and rebellious, and Freud's was a
lone voice. Medical opinion was that hysteria as a pathology was
exclusively limited to women because women had wombs and because women
were obviously hysterical. Despite Freud's apostasy and its subsequent
acceptance in psychoanalytic theory, hysteria is still associated with
the female. She does not have reason or intellect; she has emotion. She
starts with a lot of emotion by virtue of being female; when she gets
more emotion than is socially acceptable, or when emotion begins to
interfere with the exercise of her female functions or the performance
of her female duties, then she is sedated or tranquilized. Female
complaints to male doctors are perceived as emotional excrescences; and
indeed, women learn as girls that either they convince through emotional
display or they do not convince at all, so that women do tend to
persuade by force of feeling and do learn early to compensate for the
almost certain knowledge that they will not be believed because they are
not credible no matter how accurate, restrained, or logical they are.
The solution to female emotional excess, whether expressed by the
woman---appropriately by her lights---or hallucinated by the male
doctor, is keeping women calm or numb or asleep with drugs. The dulling
of the female mind is neither feared nor noticed; nor is the loss of
vitality or independence. The female is valued for how she
looks---sometimes droopy eyelids are quite in fashion---and for
domestic, sex, and reproductive work, none of which requires that she be
alert. She is given drugs because nothing is lost when she is drugged,
except what is regarded as the too thick edge of her emotional life. She
is given drugs because she is not much valued; she takes the drugs
because she is not much valued; she stays on the drugs because she is
not much valued; the doctors keep prescribing the drugs because she is
not much valued; the effects of addiction or dependency on her are not
much noted because she is not much valued. These are prescription drugs,
regarded as appropriate medications for women. The junkie, for the most
part, is left to the violent life of the streets; the woman addicted to
prescribed drugs has already been tamed and is kept tamed by the drugs.
The drugs are prescribed to these huge numbers of women each and every
year because their usage not only supports but significantly upholds
social policy with respect to women: their effects reinforce women in
traditional female roles, postures, and passivity; they dull women's
perceptions of and responses to an environment and predetermined social
status that are demeaning, aggravating, and enraging; they quiet women
down. The use of these drugs to numb these masses of women shows only
how little women are worth---to the doctors who do the prescribing, to
the women themselves, to the society that depends on this mass drugging
of women to help in keeping women as a class quiescent and women as
individuals invisible or aberrant. Thirty-six million women can be
tranquilized in a year and the nation does not notice it, does not miss
their energy, creativity, wit, intellect, passion, commitment--- so much
are these women worth, so important is their contribution, so indelible
is their individuality, so essential is their vigor.]{.font3}

[In addition to being too emotional, women can be too fat. In fact, it
is hard not to be; and it is sometimes pointed out that Amerikan
standards of beauty dictate a leanness closer to the skeletal depravity
of concentration camp victims than to any other socially recognized
physiognomy. Most amphetamines are prescribed as diet pills, although
women use them to propel themselves through the normal routine of a day.
Depression is commonplace among women because housework is boring, sex
is boring, cooking is boring, children are boring, and the woman resents
being bored but cannot change it. Depression is commonplace among women
because women are often angry at the conditions of their lives, at what
they must do because they are women, at the way they are treated because
they are women; and depression truly is anger turned inward. Depression
is commonplace among women because a woman's life is often a series of
dead ends, joy in which is the measure of femininity. A decade or two
ago, doctors prescribed amphetamines with a reckless abandon. Now they
are more cautious, and not only because amphetamines wreak havoc on the
human body: amphetamines lead women away from femininity toward
aggression, social dysphoria, and a paranoia that threatens the women's
compliance as a sexual partner; tranquilizers and sleeping pills
interfere much less with the female life as it should be lived, no
matter how serious the addiction. Doctors justify the use of
amphetamines---by those 12 million women users in one year, for
instance---in terms of getting women thinner. Women get the drug by
saying they want or need to be thinner no matter how thin they are; or
doctors prescribe the drug without explanation as to its qualities and
effects---especially they make no reference to its addictive nature and
to the high it produces. The woman knows her value is in becoming what
the man wants to have; she has no sense of self outside his evaluation
of what she should be. Male doctors essentially share the same male
values; and women accept their authority as men, not just as doctors.
The woman's body is evaluated according to a sexual aesthetic, not
according to a medical ethic. Amphetamines prescribed by a doctor
reinforce the misogynist rule that a woman's only wealth is her body as
an object; and that any act of self-destruction---like taking
amphetamines---is both justified and sexually enhancing if it makes her
what men want. Doctors accept and sometimes encourage this logic;
doctors often subscribe to it and pass it on to women. If women are not
thin, what are they? This is not a standard that can be applied to a
respected or self-respecting individual or to a respected or
self-respecting group; it is applied ruthlessly to women and it is not
applied to men.]{.font3}

[But the doctors know that women use amphetamines not just to get
thinner but also to stay awake in the course of brutally soporific days;
to push away paralyzing bouts of depression that come from the quality
of the woman's life---her accurate perception of it; to get the energy
to put one foot in front of another in a life she hates but feels
powerless to change. So that even the use of amphetamines---with effects
that are apparently opposite to those of tranquilizers and
sedatives---keeps the woman in her life as it is and as a male-dominated
society wants it to be; it keeps her functioning in the domestic sphere,
whether exclusively or not; it keeps her going through the habits of
being female; it keeps her executing the routines of a life that
dissatisfies her profoundly. And the social imperative is to keep her
there, no matter what the cost to her as an individual. So the doctors
write the prescriptions. Prescribed amphetamines keep the woman
conforming when she was ready to stop dead in her tracks, keep her
female when she would rather be genuinely inert and inanimate, keep her
doing what she could not bring herself to do without them.]{.font3}

[These drugs---amphetamines, tranquilizers, sedatives---are agents of
social control; an elite male group does the controlling; women are the
class controlled. The willingness of the doctors--- male medical
professionals---to use these drugs on women systematically and the
perceptions of women that lead them to do so are evidence of the
expendability of women, the essential worthlessness of women when
measured against a human standard as opposed to a standard of female
function. One does not dump drugs on society's best and brightest; nor
is a drug habit encouraged in those who have work to do, a future with
some promise, and a right to dignity and self-esteem. Through the use of
drugs, the doctors are doing their part in the social control of women.
They have shown themselves willing---even eager sometimes---to go
further. Decades ago clitoridectomies were all the rage as doctors did
their surgical bit to control sexual delinquency in women. Now, after
being out of fashion for a few short years, the doctors are trying to
bring psychosurgery back into style. In a violent society, they say, it
is more than useful; it is necessary. The ideal patient for lobotomy is
considered to be a black female. Her violence, apparently, is simply in
being a black female. She is ideal for the operation because afterward
she can still perform the functions for which she is best suited: she
can be female in all the conventional ways, and she can still clean
other people's houses.]{.font3}

[Surgeons, however, need step in only where welfare programs have
already failed to provide a pool of cheap black female labor.
In]{.font3} [Regulating the Poor: The Functions of Public
Welfare,\*]{.font3}[ Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward show that
black women have been given less money than white women in welfare
payments and as a result have had to do menial work to achieve the
barest subsistence; or have been kept off the welfare rolls altogether
by administrators who have manipulated regulations to exclude blacks, in
keeping with the racist policies of local or state governments. This
pattern of discrimination was particularly evident in the South, but it
was also found in other regions of the country:]{.font3}

> [There are many mechanisms by which Southern welfare departments deny
> or reduce payments to blacks, thus keeping them in the marginal labor
> market. The "employable mother" rule \[that a mother must work if the
> welfare agency determines that there is appropriate work for her\]\...
> has been applied discriminatorily against black women: when field
> hands are needed, Southern welfare officials assume that a black woman
> is employable, but not a white woman. ^8^]{.font3}

[These machinations of the welfare system are commonplace and pervasive.
A great effort has been made---contrary to public perceptions---to keep
black women off the welfare rolls, to make them even more marginal and
often even poorer than those on welfare. The specifics can change---for
instance, which women must work, when, and why---but the kind of control
the welfare system seeks to exercise over poor women does not change.
The first "employable mother" rule was invoked in Louisiana in 1943;
Georgia adopted the same kind of regulation in 1952; in 1968 a federal
court in Atlanta struck down Georgia's "employable mother" rule, which
was widely considered to have negated the force of that rule in the
states where it existed; and yet in 1967 Congress had required states to
make mothers on welfare report for work or work training---a law
erratically enforced and therefore subject to the same abuses as the old
"employable mother" regulation. The kind of control welfare exercises
over poor women does not change because the population welfare is
designed to control does not change: female.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[An important book that analyzes the economic value of
racism under capitalism but sadly fails to address the exploitation of
women as such; as a result, the social and sexual controls on the
welfare population are understood superficially; the ubiquitous and
almost self-renewing nature of the controls is not taken seriously
enough---it is not recognized that as long as the sexual oppression is
intact, the controls will keep appearing, even if reform seems to have
eliminated them.]{.sgc-2}

[The question of suitable employment is raised persistently within the
welfare system: what is to be expected of women with children? should
they work or stay home? what kind of work are they offered or forced to
take? is that work entirely determined by prejudgments as to their
nature---what can and should be expected of them because they are
female, female and black, female and white, female and poor, female and
unmarried? In New York City, women on welfare say that they have been
strongly encouraged by welfare workers to turn to prostitution, the
threat being that the individual woman may in the future be denied
welfare benefits because the caseworker knows the woman could be making
big bucks on the street; or in emergencies, women on welfare are told to
raise the money they need by turning a trick or two. In Nevada, where
prostitution is legal, women on welfare have been forced off welfare
because they refused to accept the suitable employment of prostitution;
once it is a legal, state-regulated job, there is no basis for refusing
it. Prostitution has long been considered suitable employment for poor
women whether it is legal or not. This is particularly cynical in the
welfare system, given the fact that women on welfare have been subjected
to "fornication checks"---questioned about their sexual relations at
length, questioned as to the identity of the fathers of so-called
illegitimate children, questioned as to their own sexual habits,
activities, and partners---and have been denied welfare if living with a
man or if a man spends any time in the domicile or if having a sexual
relationship with a man. Their homes could be inspected anytime:
searches were common after midnight, when the welfare workers expected
to find the contraband man; the courts put a stop to late searches but
daytime searches are still legal. Beds, closets, and clothes were
inspected to see if any remnant of a male presence could be found.
Sometimes criminal charges of fornication were actually brought against
the mothers of illegitimate children; the purpose was to keep them from
getting welfare. For instance, in one typical case, a New Jersey woman
was convicted of fornication and given a suspended sentence; she was
forced to name the father, who went to prison. Welfare workers were
allowed to interrogate children concerning the social and sexual habits
of their mothers. Women on welfare have even been required to tell when
they menstruate. Women on welfare have had no rights to sexual privacy;
and in this context, turning them toward prostitution goes right along
with refusing to allow them private, intimate, self-determined sexual
relations. Prostitution is the ultimate loss of sexual privacy. Gains
made in the courts in the 1960s to restore rights of privacy to these
women are being nullified by new welfare policies and regulations
designed to control the same population in the same old ways---practices
that reappear in new guises but are built on the same old attitudes and
impinge on the welfare population in the same old and cruel ways. The
state is a jealous lover, except when it pimps.]{.font3}

[Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) is the largest federal
welfare program: this is welfare for women and their dependent children.
As of 1977, 52. 6 percent of the recipients were white, 43 percent were
black, and 4. 4 percent were designated as "American Indian and other. "
Welfare fundamentally articulates the state's valuation of women as
women; the condition of women determines the philosophical bases and
practical strategies of the welfare system; \* the racist structure of
class provides a framework in which women can be isolated, punished, and
destroyed as women. In the welfare system, racism increases the jeopardy
for black women in particular in a multiplicity of ways. But the
degradation built into the welfare system in general and AFDC in
particular originates in social attitudes toward women: in sexual
contempt for women; in paternalistic assumptions about women; in moral
codes exclusively applied to women; in notions of immorality that have
no currency except when applied to women. Women not on welfare are
cruelly hurt by these same endemic woman-hating attitudes; but women on
welfare have nothing between them and a police-state exercise of
authority and power over them in which and by which they are degraded
because they are women and the state is the real head of the household.
AFDC controls women who have no husbands to keep them in line; it
caretakes women, keeps them always hungry and dependent and desperate
and accessible; it keeps them watching their children go hungry and
underclothed and uneducated; it tells them exactly what they are worth
to their lord and master, the state, in dollars and cents. In 1979 they
were worth \$111 per month in Alabama, \$144 per month in Arkansas,
\$335 per month in Connecticut, \$162 per month in Florida, and so on.
In Hawaii they were worth most: \$389 per month. In Mississippi they
were worth least: \$84 per month. In New York State, with the largest
welfare budget, they were worth \$370 per month. These were average
payments per month per family (for the woman and her dependent
children).]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[This is not to suggest that welfare does not have
devastating consequences for black men. It is to suggest that the whole
system, including its impact on black men, is ultimately comprehensible
only when we understand to what extent the feminizing of the oppressed
is part of public policy and therefore fundamentally related to the
degradation of women as a class. ]{.sgc-2}

[Suitable employment standards, for instance, in whatever form they
appear, are used to degrade women: to punish women for being poor by
enclosing them in a terrible trap---they have children to raise and the
only work they are offered will not feed their children, it is degrading
work, it is a dead end, it is meaningless, it is intrinsically
exploitative; and women with husbands who have some money or good jobs
or steady jobs are being pressured to stay home and]{.font3} [be
good]{.font3} [mothers. How is the mother in the welfare population
supposed to be a good mother? The answer is always the same: she is not
supposed to have had the children to begin with, and she is not supposed
to have any more, and her suffering is no more than she deserves. The
welfare system combines the imperatives of sex and money: get a man to
marry and support you or we will punish you and yours until you wish you
were all dead. The welfare system also combines the imperatives of
morality and money: your shameless bad ways got you knocked up, girl;
now you be good or we are going to do you in. Even when the issue is
suitable employment, it is always in the air: you wouldn't be here if
you hadn't done wrong; so where we send you is where you go and what we
tell you to do is what you do---because you deserve it because you are
bad.]{.font3}

[So, in addition to suitable employment, the welfare system has
been---and will continue to be---preoccupied with what are called
"suitable homes" and with what can be called "suitable morality, "
something of a redundancy. Most AFDC programs were established by 1940;
by 1942 over half the states had "suitable homes" laws. These laws
demanded that women meet certain social and sexual standards in order to
qualify for welfare benefits: illegitimate children, for instance, would
make a home not suitable; any infraction of conventional social behavior
for women might do the same; any overt or noticeable sex life might do
the same. The women could keep the children---the homes were suitable
enough for that---but were not entitled to any money from the chaste
government. As Piven and Cloward make very clear, this meant that the
women had to work doing whatever menial labor they could find; they
simply had no recourse. But it also meant that the state had become the
instrument of God: welfare's mission, from the beginning, was to punish
women for having had sex outside of marriage, for having had children
outside of marriage, for having had children at all---for being women.
With righteousness on its side, the welfare program and those who made
and executed its policies punished women through starvation for having
"unsuitable homes, " that is, illegitimate children.]{.font3}

[Mothers and their dependent children are purged en masse from the
welfare rolls whenever a state government decides its purity is being
sullied because it gives money to immoral women. A typical purge, for
instance, took place in Florida in 1959. Seven thousand families with
over 30, 000 children were deprived of benefits because of the suitable
home law. According to a report for the then Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, these families met all the eligibility
requirements for welfare but were denied benefits "where one or more of
the children was illegitimate\... or where the welfare worker reported
that the mother's past or present conduct of her sex life was not
acceptable when examined in the light of the spirit of the law. "^9^
Other states, including Northern states, have done the same. By virtue
of being illegitimate, the children are being reared in unsuitable
homes; therefore, they can starve. This is a fine exercise in state
morality. The benefit to the state is concrete: the women must do the
cheapest labor; in economic terms, welfare is a refined instrument of
state power and of capitalism. In what looks like chaos, it accomplishes
a serious goal---creating and maintaining a pool of degraded labor,
cheaper than dirt. In terms of its other function, it is not so refined
an instrument yet. It is supposed to keep these women from having
children; it is supposed to discourage them, punish them, force them to
have fewer children. It is supposed to use the twin weapons of money and
hunger---reinforced by fear of suffering and death---to stop these women
from reproducing. Sterilization has a legislative history in the United
States: in 1915 thirteen states had mandatory sterilization laws (for
"degenerates"); and by 1932 twenty-seven states had laws mandating
sterilization for various kinds of social misfits. As Linda Gordon said
in]{.font3} [Woman\'s Body]{.font3}[,]{.font3} [Woman\'s Right:]{.font3}
["The sterilization campaign tended to identify economic dependence with
hereditary feeble-mindedness or worse. "^10^ It has been proposed over
and over again: if these women are going to keep having these bastards,
after the second or third or fourth, we have the right to stop them,
sterilize them---for their own good and because we are paying the bills.
Sterilization has been practiced on poor women piecemeal. So far there
is no judicial carte blanche that extends the power of the state
explicitly to the tying of tubes because a woman is on welfare. But when
doctors sterilize Medicaid women, they know they are acting in concert
with the best interests of the government that administers welfare; and
the government does not hesitate to pay the doctor for his good deed. So
far, the strategies of the state in stopping women on welfare from
having children have been crude. The government has tried to police
their sexual relations, enforce chastity, keep men out of their homes,
punish them for having illegitimate children, starve them and their
children: state policy is one of absolute, cruel, murderous
paternalism.]{.font3}

[Welfare policy has usually been interpreted in terms of its impact on
black men. From the state (police) side, the effort is to keep a
shiftless man from living off the welfare benefits of a woman; to keep
men from defrauding welfare by using benefits intended for women and
children; to get black families back into the patriarchal mode, that is,
headed by males, for reasons of traditional morality or economics; to
force black men to marry black women and be legally responsible for the
children. From the antiracist side, welfare policy has been seen as a
blanket effort to destroy black men or the black family, which, when
headed by a woman, is seen as inherently degraded. The absent black male
is the political focus and priority. But neither side penetrates to the
real meaning of welfare policy because both sides keep their eye on the
man as the significant figure in the drama. The state, obviously, does
not intend any economic dignity for that man or that same state would
not promote black male unemployment in its economic policies and create
a situation, through welfare, in which husbands are forced to abandon
women and children so as to be sure they do not starve. From the
antiracist perspective, the efforts of welfare have been deeper and far
more malevolent than can be realized if its impact on men is seen as
primary, because the effort has been to stop or significantly diminish
reproduction through social control of women. The notion that the state
has acted to promote the conventional male-dominated family (by
persecution of unmarried mothers, for instance) is only superficially
viable. If that were its real interest, other state policies would
support that same goal. Instead, welfare policy has directly concerned
itself with controlling women. The most intrusive and degrading
regulations back from the beginning of welfare all have to do with women
as women: all have to do with a gender-specific regulation of motherhood
and sex. These policies all articulate the reproductive worth of women
on welfare to the state, and that value is almost entirely negative.
\*]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[The one positive value is that the women and their progeny
are cheap labor, as discussed previously in this chapter.]{.sgc-2}

[The causes of the need for welfare (from the human, not the state,
point of view) are in the systematic economic discrimination against
women, with black women suffering the most stark economic deprivation,
and in the systematic sexual degradation of women. Welfare is the barest
maintenance for those who, being female and poor, would otherwise slowly
die. Those kicked off the welfare rolls in the endless quest for those
who are poor but pure get jobs where they are paid]{.font3}
[less]{.font3} [than welfare provides; and welfare provides shit. They
work, keeping those upholders of the Protestant work ethic happy, and go
hungry at the same time. The poverty of women is appalling. As of
December 1981, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that unemployment
for females who headed households was nearly twice that of males who
headed households: 10. 6 percent for the women; 5. 8 percent for the
men. Gay Talese, who wrote about the sex industry, found it meaningful
in terms of sexual liberation that the women in massage parlors giving
him handjobs were college graduates and]{.font3} [even]{.font3} [Ph.
D.'s. It is meaningful---but in terms of what women have to do to earn
money, even with college educations and advanced degrees. The welfare
system that seeks to control women, and ultimately to destroy expendable
women (black and poor white women, Hispanics, the females of any
marginal groups), can count on the continuing poverty of these women as
women; they are never going to do better because they are women and
there are no social means to enable them to do better, except marriage
upward. The poverty of these millions of women is assured; and so is the
state's continued access to them; and so too is their continuing sexual
humiliation by state intrusion, the welfare agencies being thus far the
major enforcement arm of state policy. Since reproductive containment
(at best) has been the goal of welfare, there will be continued state
intrusion into the reproductive lives of poor women---with the endemic
racism of the United States putting black women consistently at the
highest risk. The intrusion will be under the guise of morality, as it
has always been, a morality applied exclusively to women, a morality
that no right-wing senator or congressman would ever think of using the
state to apply to men. It will also be disguised---by those more
secular---as concern for the black family: controlling the sexual
promiscuity of the woman, reinstating the black man in the master's
bedroom, such as it is on his block. Under the surface, there will be a
different truth: the state, through the welfare system as a whole, wants
to control the fertility of the woman and will not ever let the black
man come in out of the cold. The state regulates the sexual use of non
welfare women for the benefit of men as a class, and it attempts to
control the fertility of nonwelfare women in cooperation with the men
whose interests it represents: the men who are lovers, fathers,
husbands, rapists, and police all at the same time. But the state
directly]{.font3} [owns]{.font3} [the sexuality of women on welfare---at
least from its point of view it does---and it wants to own their
fertility outright too. Sometimes the state explicitly exercises the
ownership it has in enforcing so-called moral standards for a subject
group of women: sometimes it punishes women for having had children
against its will. The slow starving and degrading of these women is not
yet widely viewed as genocidal; genocide is not articulated as state
policy. That is because the political and legal tools available to
welfare in its pursuit of reproductive control of poor women have been
crude. But illegal abortion, which looms large on the horizon in the
form of the monstrous Human Life Amendment, and forced sterilization,
practiced sporadically so far but lurking for decades as what the
government really wants to do, will make a genocidal policy practical,
effective, and frankly inevitable. When abortion is illegal, black
women, Hispanic women, and poor women get
slaughtered.[ \*]{.sgc-15}Allowing the government to regulate the
uterus---as in the Human Life Amendment---will directly preface an overt
policy of forced sterilization. Forced sterilization cannot be explicit
state policy until a measure like the Human Life Amendment is adopted:
until abortion is absolutely reckoned murder legally and is punished as
murder, so that the state is empowered literally to investigate the
woman's womb, her menses, her discharges. Once every fertilized egg must
be brought to term, what are we to do with all those poor, promiscuous,
dumb sluts who keep having bastards? After all, doesn't the government
have the right to force such women to stop having babies? isn't the
government paying for them? aren't those women immoral, fucking around
and having babies for the money? If every fertilized egg is going to be
brought to term---under penalty of a murder charge for failing to
discharge that obligation---isn't it best just to insist that women
taking government money have their tubes tied? And doesn't this
combination of illegal abortion---prohibited in a way never existing
before, prohibited from conception---and forced sterilization finally
meet the not-so-hidden agenda of welfare: doesn't it finally provide the
state with a way to control---absolutely and effectively---the fertility
of poor women? Enough poor women can be kept having enough babies to
provide whatever cheap labor is essential; but the rest are
expendable.]{.font3}

[And what is going to happen to women, these women and all women, when
the tools of reproductive control of women are no longer technologically
(medically) crude? when the technology catches up with the political and
legal leap into the Orwellian future? What is going to happen to women
when life can be made in the laboratory and men can control reproduction
not just socially but also biologically with real efficiency?]{.font3}

[The value of a female life is determined by its reproductive value.
What will happen to all the women who are not altogether necessary
because]{.font3} [their]{.font3} [children in particular are not
altogether desirable? The old women starving in poverty are starving
because their reproductive lives are over and they are worth nothing.
The old women incarcerated in cruel nursing homes are there because
their reproductive lives are over and they are worth nothing. The women
who are too poor or too black or brown and who have too many children
are starved and threatened and degraded and slowly killed through
state-sponsored neglect]{.font3} [because]{.font3} [they are having
children, because they reproduce too much, because the value put on
their reproducing is negative and characterized by annihilating
disregard. The women who are kept in line now, millions upon millions of
them each year, through the judicious application of mood-altering
drugs, are kept chemically happy, calm, tranquil, or energetic so that
they will hang in there, have and raise the children and keep house for
their husbands even though their lives fill them with distress and
addiction is what keeps them conforming. They too are part of a
throwaway population of females: because their own well-being is
viciously subordinated to a predetermined standard of what a woman is
and what a woman does and what a woman needs to be a woman (she needs to
keep doing female things, whether she wants to or not). What are the
lives of all these women worth? Is there anything in the way they are
viewed or valued that upholds their human dignity as individuals? They
already matter very little. They are treated with cruelty or callous
indifference. They have already been thrown away. It is public policy to
throw them away. What is going to happen to women when
reproduction---the only capacity that women have that men really need
(Portnoy's piece of liver can substitute for the rest in hard
times)---is no longer the exclusive province of the class women? What is
going to happen to women who have only one argument for the importance
of their existence---that their reproductive capacities are worth a
little something (shelter, food, solace, minimal respect)---when men can
make babies?]{.font3}

[There are two models that essentially describe how women are socially
controlled and sexually used: the brothel model and the farming
model.]{.font3}

[The brothel model relates to prostitution, narrowly defined; women
collected together for the purposes of sex with men; women whose
function is explicitly nonreproductive, almost anti-reproductive; sex
animals in heat or pretending, showing themselves for sex, prancing
around or posed for sex.]{.font3}

[The farming model relates to motherhood, women as a class planted with
the male seed and harvested; women used for the fruit they bear, like
trees; women who run the gamut from prized cows to mangy dogs, from
highbred horses to sad beasts of burden.]{.font3}

[These two poles of the female condition are only superficially and
conceptually distinct and opposite. Men say the two are poles to begin
with, distinct and opposite. That male conceit is registered and
repeated until it is easier to repeat the concept by rote than to see
the reality. But the concept is only accurate (descriptive) from a male
point of view---that is, if one accepts the male definitions of both the
acts involved and the women involved. In the course of women's lives,
and therefore from a woman-based perspective, the two conditions overlap
and intersect, each reinforcing the efficacy of the other. Any woman can
be both a prostitute and a mother, a prostitute and a wife (a potential
mother), or one then the other in either order; and any woman can be
subject to the imperatives of both the brothel and the farming models of
female usage. On a grand scale, more women become mothers, fewer
prostitutes.]{.font3}

[In general, the euphemisms of religion and romantic love keep women
from ever recognizing the farming model as having to do directly and
personally with them. Modern women do not think of themselves as cows,
nor as land that the man seeds; but maleheaded marriage incorporates
both these vivid traditions of female definition; and the laws have been
built on these same images and ideas of what women are for; and the real
history of women has had as its center the actual use of women as cows
and as land. The way women are treated, valued, and used has remarkably
little in common with how women perceive themselves. The legend says
that vampires cannot see themselves in mirrors, but in this case the
vampires' victims cannot see themselves: what would stare back--- the
cow, the land, the uterus, the crop, the plowing, the planting, the
harvest, being put out to pasture, going dry---would annihilate the
delusion of individuality that keeps most women going. The laws that
made women chattel derived from an analogy between women and cows that
hundreds of centuries of men found apt, and the sexual slur was
apparently a neutral observation infused with the spleen of the
moment---she's a cow. The idea that the male plants and the woman is
planted in originates in antiquity, and Marcuse among others has
reiterated the idea that woman is the land in more modern times. The
farming model is not discussed as such, even among feminists. It too
clearly reveals the hopeless impersonality, degradation, and futility
implicit in women's subordinate position.]{.font3}

[The brothel model is more familiar, partly because the situation of
prostitutes is held up to all women as warning, threat, inevitable doom
and damnation, the hellish punishment of girls gone wrong: punishment
for being women involved in sex without the protection of marriage and
the purpose of reproduction; punishment for being bad or rebellious or
sexually precocious; punishment for being female without the cleansing
sacraments.]{.font3}

[In the brothel model, the woman is acknowledged to be for sex without
reference to reproduction. She will still have babies perhaps, but no
one owes her anything: not the father, not the state, not the pimp, not
the john, no one. Some women on the Left accept the male leftist view
that this is a giant step for womankind: that this separation of sex and
reproduction is in fact a form of freedom---freedom from domestic
constraint and domestic submission, freedom from an intrinsically
totalitarian association of sex with reproduction. They do not recognize
that in the brothel model sex is dissociated from reproduction so that
the sex can be sold, so that sex (not babies) is what is produced, so
that an intrinsically totalitarian association is forged between sex and
money expressed lucidly in the selling of the woman as a sexual
commodity. In the brothel model, the woman is considered to be sexually
free even by those who think prostitution is bad or wrong; sexual
freedom is when women do the things men think are sexy; the more women
do these things, the more sexually free they are. Whatever the
conditions of the woman's life, there is no perception that prostitution
is by its nature antithetical to freedom. Sometimes the prostitute is
construed to be economically liberated. In selling sex, money passes
through her hands: more money than the housewife or the secretary will
have in hand on any given night. The brothel model particularly fosters
these obfuscations of the female condition because the women are
entirely interchangeable; perceived in terms of function they are
entirely interchangeable; even among themselves, any one could step out
of her own life into the life of the next woman and not notice the
difference. Nothing that happens in the brothel is seen or has to be
seen or recognized or remembered or reckoned with: these women live
outside of history and what happens to them happens behind closed doors
and in a place constructed to control the kind of women in it. They live
entirely on male terms. Whatever happens to them is appropriate on those
male terms because of what they do and what they are, all of which is
expressed in where they are. The impersonality of the brothel as a
working place is precisely congruent with the impersonality of their
sexual function; men romanticize the place and the function for
themselves, to themselves, for their own sakes, men among men; but even
men are not so dense as to try to romanticize prostitution to the
prostitute.]{.font3}

[In the brothel model, the women are held to a strictly sexual standard
of behavior and accountability: they sell themselves for sex, not to
make babies. They do what men want them to do for money that men pay
them and that then they usually turn over to a man. Women are defined
strictly with reference to sex and they are defined unfailingly without
reference to personality or individuality or human potential; they are
used without reference to anything but sex orifices and sex class and
sex scenes. In the brothel model, several women belong to one man or in
some cases are supervised by an older woman who is herself accountable
to a rich man or men. The job of the women is to bring in---to a man or
to a house---a certain amount of money by servicing a certain number of
men. They sell parts of their bodies---vagina, rectum, mouth; and they
also sell acts---what they say and what they do. In sex, they absorb,
endure, or get indifferent toward an enormous amount of male aggression,
hostility, and contempt. Men have few restraints in expressing to
prostitutes---during sex or in any sexual scenario---their real
attitudes toward women as a class; they have no reason to feel
constrained, since the woman is there to be a woman, period---to be
inferior, subservient, and used. She is there because the man wants a
woman, someone exactly of her class, someone who is her sex function,
not human but an it, a cunt: she is there for that reason, not for
anything human in her. Her function is limited, specialized,
sex-specific, and intensely and intrinsically dehumanizing.]{.font3}

[It is essential to recognize how genuinely accepted both the brothel
model and prostitution are in the social structure, and how this
disposition of women is simply accepted as inevitable because they are
women. However evil prostitution is held to be, however righteous or
religious men are said to be, the brothel model does more than endure;
it thrives. However marginal the women are said to be, they form the sex
nucleus of a sex industry that is in no sense marginal. The brothel
model thrives because men accept it and all that is part of it as proper
treatment for sexual women: women who are sexual in male terms, women
who get fucked by many men, women who get fucked outside the protective
custody of a traditional father or husband. The staying power of both
the brothel as an institution and prostitution as a practice comes from
the efficacy of both for regulating the sexual use of women and the
disposition of sexually exploitable women. Think of what it means. The
brothel is most often something like a prison---women cannot come and go
freely. Women are displayed, used, and treated like sexual things or
sexual animals, all penned up. The brothel exists usually with the tacit
or overt protection of police and politicians; the brothel is used by
the rich and powerful as well as by all other kinds of men; the brothel
is the kind of place men like to have women in, confined in, locked in,
penned in, shut in; the brothel suggests a wealth of women available to
the man, it means he is rich in having so many women in one place for
him, it means he chooses absolutely and his will is done by whomever he
chooses. Prostitution is the way women are used in the brothel model; it
is what women are shut in for, penned in for. The street comer merely
extends the brothel beyond the walls of a building into the cold and
rain. Pimps run several prostitutes; and usually some or all live
together, whether business is done in the domicile or not. This is a
version of the brothel: a kind of public harem. The brothel model can
simply be imposed on a neighborhood, which then becomes a ghetto for
prostitutes. In some cities with good reputations for socially advanced
ideas, women sit in windows, posing for potential customers. This is
widely regarded as a humane and civilized way of conducting the business
of prostitution. The brothel, in such cities, is considered a nice
place, good for the girls. It is the acceptance of the brothel model as
an appropriate way of treating some women, these women, sexed women,
prostituted women, used women, degraded women, public women, any women,
that has unyielding and unchanging social significance for all women.
Once a prostituted woman exists, she can be shut up in a house where men
come to find and use women like her, to use her because she is a woman.
It is naughty to force her to prostitute herself, though women and girls
are mainly forced into prostitution; but once prostituted---by whatever
means---she is for sex and the brothel is her proper abode and the use
made of her there is proper; it is a woman's place, and this is accepted
by the religious and irreligious, police and outlaws, users and
abstainers. A pimp's women are referred to as his "stable, " but the
analogy with horses is misleading. Horses are treated better, being more
valuable. Prostitutes get treated like women; no analogy fits. For men
this way of life would be seen clearly as a deprivation of human
freedom; for women it is appropriate to what they are---women. These
women are not missed; in fulfilling this sexual function, it is not
thought that]{.font3} [they]{.font3} [are wasted. There is a difference
between female garbage and human waste. In the United States, there are
hundreds of thousands of these women; in the world, millions upon
millions. The brothel model keeps these women locked in for sex, and
both the devout and the sexually liberated think that is the way it
should be. Both think this is a sexy way for women to live. The women
are disposed of, used for what they are seen to be, used as their sex,
their class-defined essence and function, the sex work to which some
percentage of the sex class must be dedicated. ]{.font3}[This use of
women is thought to be not only an inevitable and appropriate use of
women but one that always was and always will be.]{.sgc-5}

[The defenses of the brothel model applied to women are entrenched. In
his study of prostitution, first published in 1857, William Acton
articulated what has come to be accepted as a moderate, sensible point
of view:]{.font3}

> [It seems to me vain to shut our eyes to the fact that prostitution
> must always exist. Regret it as we may, we cannot but admit that a
> woman if so disposed may make profit of her own person, and that the
> State has no right to prevent her. It has a right, however, in my
> opinion, to insist that she shall not, in trafficking with her person,
> became a medium of communicating disease, and that, as she has given
> herself up to an occupation dangerous to herself and others, she must,
> in her own interest and that of the community, submit to supervision.
> ^11^]{.font3}

[The state creates the conditions in which the woman is prostituted,
sanctions force against her to effect her prostitution by systematically
ignoring it, creates the economic conditions that mandate her
prostitution, fixes her social place so that her sex is a commodity; and
then, prostitution is seen to exist because the woman wills it and the
political question is whether or not the state should interfere with
this expression of her will. What is seen as the eternal dimension of
prostitution---why it must always exist---is that the will of women to
prostitute themselves will always exist. This means, simply, that men
accept that the conditions that create prostitution are acceptable,
fixed, and appropriate because prostitution is a proper use of women,
one congruent with what women are. The harm done is when she carries
disease. Wherever prostitution is legal and regulated, it is usually to
control disease, to protect men from disease; the woman is the
instrument by which harm comes to the man.]{.font3}

[It is the social and economic construction of the woman's will that is
the issue: both in that feminists assert that this will is constructed
outside the individual and in that apologists for the sexual
exploitation of women---again both religious and irreligious---insist
that the will is interior, individual, an individual assertion of a
female sexual nature.]{.font3}

[The notion of female will always articulated in discussions of
prostitution (and currently pornography) also is central in a new area
of discourse on what women are for: surrogate motherhood. A man, married
to an infertile woman or on his own, wants a baby; he buys the egg and
the use of the womb of a surrogate mother---a woman who will accept the
introjection of his sperm through artificial insemination, gestate and
give birth to what is contractually established as his child. In vitro
fertilization---in which the egg is extracted from a woman surgically,
fertilized in a petri dish, then vaginally introjected into the
female---expands the possibilities of surrogate motherhood. The uterus
is exempt from the immune response. Scientists already are able to
remove the egg of one woman, fertilize it outside her body, then
introduce it into a second woman's uterus, where it will gestate.
\* They have not done so, but there is no technological barrier to doing
so. These two reproductive technologies---artificial insemination and in
vitro fertilization---enable women to sell their wombs within the terms
of the brothel model. Motherhood is becoming a new branch of female
prostitution with the help of scientists who want access to the womb for
experimentation and for power. A doctor can be the agent of
fertilization; he can dominate and control conception and reproduction.
Women can sell reproductive capacities the same way old-time prostitutes
sold sexual ones but without the stigma of whoring because there is no
penile intrusion. It is the womb, not the vagina, that is being bought;
this is not sex, it is reproduction. The arguments as to the social and
moral appropriateness of this new kind of sale simply reiterate the view
of female will found in discussions of prostitution: does the state have
a right to interfere with this exercise of individual female will (in
selling use of the womb)? if a woman wants to sell the use of her womb
in an explicit commercial transaction, what right has the state to deny
her this proper exercise of femininity in the marketplace? Again, the
state has constructed the social, economic, and political situation in
which the sale of some sexual or reproductive capacity is necessary to
the survival of women; and yet the selling is seen to be an act of
individual will---the only kind of assertion of individual will in women
that is vigorously defended as a matter of course by most of those who
pontificate on female freedom. The state denies women a host of other
possibilities, from education to jobs to equal rights before the law to
sexual self-determination in marriage; but it is state intrusion into
her selling of sex or a sex-class-specific capacity that provokes a
defense of her will, her right, her individual self--- defined strictly
in terms of the will to sell what is appropriate for females to
sell.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[According to Gena Corea, an expert in these technologies
and their effects on women, "men are hoping to fertilize an egg]{.font2
.sgc-1 .sgc-10} [inside]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10} [a woman's body (in

yet been done. " Letter to the author, February 12, 1982. The pure
sadism of this seems outstanding.]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10}

[This individual woman is a fiction---as is her will---since
individuality is precisely what women are denied when they are defined
and used as a sex class. As long as issues of female sexual and
reproductive destiny are posed as if they are resolved by individuals as
individuals, there is no way to confront the actual conditions that
perpetuate the sexual exploitation of women. Women by definition are
condemned to a predetermined status, role, and function. In terms of
prostitution, Josephine Butler, a nineteenth-century crusader against
prostitution, explained the obvious implications of its sex-based
nature:]{.font3}

> [My principle has always been to let individuals alone, not to pursue
> them with any outward punishment, nor drive them]{.font3} [out of any
> place]{.font3} [so long as they behave decently, but to
> attack]{.font3} [organized prostitution]{.font3}[, that is when a
> third party, activated by the desire of making money, sets up a house
> in which women are sold to men. ^12^]{.font3}

[This is the opposite of what the state does when prostitution is
illegal: the state harasses and persecutes individual prostitutes and
leaves the institutions and the powerful who profit from them alone. It
does this because it is accepted that prostitution expresses the will of
the prostitute, and that therefore punishing her is the proper
expression of hostility toward prostitution. It is precisely this notion
of individual responsibility (when in fact there is only a
class-determined behavior) that perpetuates prostitution and protects
the profits and power of those who sell women to men. Feminists, unlike
the state, go after the institutions and the powerful, not the
individual women, because feminists recognize above all that the
prostitute is created by material conditions outside herself. \* In the
new prostitution of reproduction, which is just beginning to unfold, the
third party that will develop the female population for sale will be the
scientist or doctor. He is a new kind of pimp, but he is not a new enemy
of women. The formidable institutions of scientific research institutes
and medical hospitals will be the new houses out of which women are sold
to men: the use of their wombs for money.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[This does not mean that prostitution is reinvented in
every generation only through material conditions. The colonialization
of women is both external and internal, as Kate Millett made clear
in]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10} [Sexual Politics.]{.font2 .sgc-1

[Before the advent of any reproductive technologies, the farming model
used to be very distinct from the brothel model. Even though the woman
was not human---the land---or was less than human---a cow---farming had
the symbolic overtones of old-fashioned agrarian romance: plowing the
land was loving it, feeding the cow was tending it. In the farming
model, the woman was owned privately; she was the homestead, not a
public thoroughfare. One farmer worked her. The land was valued because
it produced a valuable crop; and in keeping with the mystique of the
model itself, sometimes the land was real pretty, special, richly
endowed; a man could love it. The cow was valued because of what she
produced: calves, milk; sometimes she took a prize. There was nothing
actually idyllic in this. As many as one quarter of all acts of battery
may be against pregnant women; and women die from pregnancy even without
the intervention of a male fist. But farming implied a relationship of
some substance between the farmer and what was his: and it is grander
being the earth, being nature, even being a cow, than being a cunt with
no redeeming mythology. Motherhood ensconced a woman in the continuing
life of a man: how he used her was going to have consequences for him.
Since she was his, her state of being reflected on him; and therefore he
had a social and psychological stake in her welfare as well as an
economic one. Because the man farmed the woman over a period of years,
they developed a personal relationship, at least from her point of view:
one limited by his notions of her sex and her kind; one strained because
she could never rise to the human if it meant abandoning the female; but
it was her best chance to be known, to be regarded with some tenderness
or compassion meant for her, one particular woman. Nevertheless, the
archaic meaning of the verb]{.font3} [to husband]{.font3} [is "to plow
for the purpose of growing crops. " There is not a lot of room for
tenderness or compassion in that. Still, it is no wonder that women hang
on possessively to any generic associations of women as such or "the
female" with the land, nature, earth, the environment, even though those
culturally sanctioned associations posit a female nature that is not
fully human and perpetuate a hard and mean tradition of exploitation:
there is some splendor and some honor in the association. The
association has a deep resonance for men too, though not the same
sentimental meaning: they after all did the plowing. The cultural and
sexual intersection of women and earth is potent for men when they bomb
"her, " strip-mine "her, " scorch "her, " torch "her, " denude "her, "
defoliate "her, " pollute "her, " despoil "her, " rape "her, " plunder
"her, " overcome, manipulate, dominate, conquer, or destroy "her. " The
significance of the farming model is both wide and deep. It has been the
major way of using women---as mothers to produce children;
metaphorically speaking, men have used the earth as if it were female, a
huge fertile female that---one way or another---they will fuck to death.
There are limits to how much the land can endure and produce, plowed so
much, respected so little.]{.font3}

[Both the farming model and the brothel model dispose of women as women:
they are paradigms for the mass use of a whole class; in both there is
no humanity for women. The brothel model has been efficient. It uses the
women in it until they are used up. Men get sex from them with a
graceful economy of means: effective force; hunger, degradation, drugs;
rare escape. The woman is easily reduced to what she sells. Women under
the yoke of the brothel model do not organize political movements; they
do not rebel collectively; the yoke is too heavy. Quite simply, a
percentage of the class women is given over to the brothel model;
whatever its laws, societies accept this disposition of a significant
number of females for sex service. Once within that model, these women
are controlled and used; what men want from them they get; their bodies
go where their sex is wanted; there is an absolute equation between what
they are and what they provide, between their physical bodies and their
function, between their sex and their work. There is no wasted energy
here: a prostituted female serves her purpose absolutely. The farming
model has always been relatively inefficient. It is sloppier. Picking a
woman who lives in the home with the man on a continuing basis is
harder. Picking a woman who can and will have children is harder. There
is more leeway for her attitudes to interfere. She has ways of saying no
or subverting male sexual and reproductive intentions. The brothel model
simply requires that the women under it be women: it does not matter who
they are or what they are like or where they come from or what they
think; they get worn down fast by being used the same way and being
reduced to the same common denominator; nothing is necessary except that
they be female. The farming model requires the constant application of
force (explicit or implicit, usually a nice combination), incentive,
reward; and a lot of plain luck with respect to fertility and
reproductive vigor. When a man wants sons, as most do, the inefficiency
inherent in the model is particularly emphasized: no matter how many
babies she has, there is no certainty that any of them will be male.
And, for all the coercion of the farming model, the women subject to it
have organized politically, have found ways to seize the time between
babies and domestic chores---here and there, now and then---to foment
some rebellion. The very fact that such women have been involved in
movements, especially feminist movements, argues for the inefficiency of
the farming model. The farming model has haphazard success: there are
too many factors besides the efficacy of the fuck that can interfere
with the harvesting of the crop. The quality of the crop cannot really
be predetermined either. Men, recognizing the inefficiency of the
farming model, have simply imposed it on all women not prostituted so as
not to miss a chance: they use social and economic sanctions to punish
women who try to live outside it, especially so-called spinsters and
lesbians. To anticipate and counterbalance the failures, the losses, the
tremendous element of chance, the bad breaks, the power of men as a
class has been exercised to keep all women not prostitutes reproducing
under the explicit domination of a husband. This has been the best way
men have had to control reproduction, to appropriate the uteruses of
women in order to have children, to keep the women subject to the
reproductive will of the men. The use of women by men in this
reproductive tyranny has been presented as what women are for: a proper
use of females, the best actualization of their human potential because,
after all, they are women.]{.font3}

[Reproductive technology is now changing the terms on which men control
reproduction. The social control of women who reproduce---the sloppy,
messy kind of control---is being replaced by medical control much more
precise, much closer to the efficiency of the brothel model. This
change-over---applying the brothel model to reproduction---is just
beginning. It is beyond the scope of this book to explore or explain all
the new technological intrusions into conception, gestation, and
birth,\* except to say that reproduction will become the kind of
commodity that sex is now. Artificial insemination, in vitro
fertilization, sex selection, genetic engineering, fetal monitoring,
artificial wombs that keep the fetus alive outside the mother's body,
fetal surgery, embryo transplants, and eventual cloning (some experts
predict that human cloning will be accomplished within twenty-five
years; however long it takes, it will be done)---all these reproductive
intrusions make the womb the province of the doctor, not the woman; all
make the womb extractable from the woman as a whole person in the same
way the vagina (or sex) is now; some make the womb extraneous altogether
or eventually extraneous; all make reproduction controllable by men on a
scale heretofore unimaginable. The issue is not the particular
innovation itself---whether it is intrinsically good or bad; the issue
is how it will be used in a system in which women are sexual and
reproductive commodities already, exploited, with lives that are
worthless when not serving a specific sexual or reproductive purpose.
For instance, cesarean sections saved women's lives when used in
orthodox medical emergencies; but now doctors use them because they give
doctors dominion over labor, because they involve cutting into the
female body---a male pleasure---and so that the natural process of birth
can be circumvented for the social convenience of the doctor. Cesarean
sections are now used to express endemic male contempt for women. So it
will be with reproductive technology or other medically sophisticated
intrusions into reproduction. The ideology of male control of
reproduction will stay what it is; the hatred of women will stay what it
is; what will change will be the means of expressing both the ideology
and the hatred. The means will give conception, gestation, and birth
over to men---eventually, the whole process of the creation of life will
be in their hands. The new means will enable men---at last--- really to
have women for sex and women for reproduction, both controlled with
sadistic precision by men.]{.font3}

[\* ]{.font3}[See Gena Corea,]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10} [The Mother
Machine]{.font2 .sgc-1 .sgc-10} [(forthcoming, 1984). This book will
explain the reproductive technologies, the experiments being done on
women and animals to develop the technologies, and the view of women

[And there will be a new kind of holocaust, as unimaginable now as the
Nazi one was before it happened: something no one believes "mankind"
capable of. Using now available or soon to be available reproductive
technology in conjunction with racist programs of forced sterilization,
men finally will have the means to create and control the kind of women
they want: the kind of women they have always wanted. To paraphrase
Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka when she is defending Stalin's purges, there
will be fewer but better women. There will be domestics, sex
prostitutes, and reproductive prostitutes. Is there any reason to think
that this projected future does not reflect the commonly accepted
devaluation of women with which we live with relative complacency? Look
again at what we have done---are doing now---to the old, those in
nursing homes, the drugged, the prostituted, those on welfare, and to
those bastions of female worth, wives and mothers, whose rape the law
protects, whose battery the society invites, whose uteruses the state
wants.]{.font3}

of men to human freedom, seeing the enthusiasm of men for diminishing
others through physical domination, seeing the invisibility of women to
men, seeing the absolute disregard of humanity in women by men, seeing
the disdain of men for women's lives, and not wanting to
die]{.font3}[---and not wanting to die]{.font2 .sgc-1}[---women propose
two very different solutions for themselves in relation to men and this
man's world.]{.font3}

[The first honors the sexual and reproductive imperatives of men. This
is the right-wing solution, though those who pursue it are--- in terms
of male-defined politics---all along the political spectrum from far
Right to far Left. In this solution, women accept the definition of
their sex class, and within the terms of that definition fight for
crumbs of self-respect and social, economic, and creative worth.
Socialist movements and revolutions are predicated on an acceptance of
this sex-class definition, as are right-wing movements and
counterinsurgencies. The far-Right expression of this solution is
usually highly religious, and it is the religious idiom that makes it
distinguishable from other expressions of what is essentially the same
accommodation to male power. Specifically, the sex-class accommodation
is seen as a function of religious orthodoxy: in accommodating, women
are faithful to a divine father; women accept traditional religious
descriptions of women, female sexuality, and female nature; women accept
the duties of sexual and reproductive submission to men. The far-Right
solution translates the presumed biological destiny of women into a
politics of orthodox religion: even in a secular republic, far-Right
women live in a theocracy. Religion shrouds women in real as well as
magical grace in that the sex-class functions of women are formally
honored, carefully spelled out, and exploited within clear and
prescribed boundaries.]{.font3}

[The second solution is offered by feminists. It proposes, in the words
of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, "the individuality of each human soul\... In
discussing the rights of woman, we are to consider, first, what belongs
to her as an individual, in a world of her own, the arbiter of her own
destiny\... "^13^ This is simply a recognition of the human condition,
in which women are included. It is also the precondition for the
realization of Marx's greatest ethical idea: from each according to her
ability, to each according to her need. It is the imposition of the
sex-class definition of women on women---by any means necessary---that
devastates the human capacities of women, making them men's
subordinates, making them "women. " Feminists have a vision of women,
even women, as individual human beings; and this vision annihilates the
system of gender polarity in which men are superior and powerful. This
is not a bourgeois notion of individuality; it is not a self-indulgent
notion of individuality; it is the recognition that every human being
lives a separate life in a separate body and dies alone. In proposing
"the individuality of each human soul, " feminists propose that women
are not their sex; nor their sex plus some other little thing---a
liberal additive of personality, for instance; but that each
life---including each woman's life---must be a person's own, not
predetermined before her birth by totalitarian ideas about her nature
and her function, not subject to guardianship by some more powerful
class, not determined in the aggregate but worked out by herself, for
herself. Frankly, no one much knows what feminists mean; the idea of
women not defined by sex and reproduction is anathema or baffling. It is
the simplest revolutionary idea ever conceived, and the most
despised.]{.font3}

[In the face of advancing reproductive technology, there will be even
fewer women who dare claim their right to human life, human dignity, and
human struggle as unique and necessary individuals, fewer and fewer
women who will fight against the categorical disposition of women.
Instead, more and more women will see protection for themselves as women
in religious and devotional ideologies that formally honor the special
sanctity of motherhood. This is the only claim that women can make under
the sex-class system to a sacred nature; and religion is the best way to
make that claim---the best available way. Against the secular power of
male scientists women will try to pit the political power of misogynist
males in religion. Women will try to use male theology and religious
tradition wherever and however it sanctifies the mother giving birth.
Women will hide behind theology; women will hide behind orthodox
religious men; women will use conservative religious ideas against the
science that will make women less necessary than they have ever
been.]{.font3}

[The power of the reproductive scientists will be advanced, however,
precisely through the political and legislative initiatives of the
theocrats: prohibiting abortion and then mandating forced sterilization
will establish absolute state control of the uterus. The clash between
reproductive scientists and male theocrats in terms of absolute
values---especially the orthodox formulation of what constitutes the
family---only appears to be irresolvable. When these two schools of
unconditional male power over women have to negotiate public policy to
the mutual benefit of both, the men of theology, with that remarkable
resourcefulness that allowed for the burning of the witches, will find
great virtue in any program in which fertilized eggs truly do supersede
women in importance. They will also enjoy having both sex and
reproduction on their own terms: being God in the concrete rather than
worshiping him in the abstract. They will also enjoy---for its own
sake---the extraordinary control they will have over women: more than
Leviticus gives; more than Christ mandates; more than men have ever had,
though no doubt still less than men deserve. Women will argue like the
true believers they are for that old-time religion, but male theocrats
will discover that God intended men to be the sole creators of life all
along: did not God himself create Adam without female help and is not
baptism the religious equivalent of being born of a male God? This is
not farfetched for those who justify the subordination of women to men
on the ground that God is a boy.]{.font3}

[Ironically, cruelly, so typical of history ineluctably moving on, Right
to Life groups are the only organized political opposition to
reproductive technology, especially in vitro fertilization, \* and are
also the agents of its ascendancy in engineering legislation that would
give the uterus and the fertilized egg to the state to protect and
control. Even in giving the state the right to define when life begins,
which Right to Life groups insist on doing, Right to Life groups are
taking that power from religion and transforming it into a police power
of the state. For the sake of religion, they are taking from religion
its moral authority to demand obedience from the faithful and turning
that authority over to a soulless state apparatus incapable of moral
discernment. They are taking from God what no atheist would dare and
giving to Caesar what he has never dared claim for himself. The women in
Right to Life groups want to protect not fertilized eggs but motherhood
and their own worth as women in God's eyes as well as man's. They will
learn the crudest lesson of history: "Every decent End consumes itself.
You kill yourself trying to reach it, and by the time you get there it's
been turned inside out. "^14^ The words were written by Soviet dissident
Abram Tertz (Andrei Sinyavsky), but every passionate political activist
of conscience---whatever the "decent End"---has had occasion to say
them, in trouble and in grief. What one means to do goes wrong, it
becomes what one abhors. Right to Life women will see it too late: they
will stay mesmerized by the small tributes men pay to the idea---not the
reality---of women as mothers. The power the Right to Life women are
fighting so hard to put into the hands of the state will eventually and
inevitably be used (1) to redefine when life begins and what life is so
that the male becomes its sole creator and (2) to determine and enforce
which women reproduce, when, and how. The women not needed will have no
claim to civil dignity or civil protection. The reason for female
submission finally will be very simple and overwhelmingly clear: for
women submission will be a matter of life or death, with the right of
appeal to the sacredness of women as mothers no longer in the vocabulary
of male supremacy.]{.font3}

[ \* ]{.font3}[Each fertilized egg in a petri dish is regarded as a
human life; each time one is thrown away or "dies, " murder has been
done.]{.sgc-2}

[When women cease to be altogether necessary, politically dissident
women become altogether unnecessary. Once women are biologically
expendable on a grand scale, political women need no longer be tolerated
on any scale. Politically dissident women are considered unnecessary
now: this is the mood toward feminists and other women who rebel;
someday it will be policy, not a mood. ]{.font3}[The criteria for
politically dissident women---troublemakers---will be extended to
include any women not domestics, sex prostitutes, or reproductive
prostitutes. The religiously orthodox women will find themselves
characterized as politically dissident women one day too: there they
will be, advocating and upholding old laws, customs, and ideas that are
no longer in the best interests of men. They will be demanding more than
men want them to have and there will be no concessions from men: because
men will be able to control reproduction without the mass complicity of
women. Reduced to its simplest elements, the old misogyny was expressed
by the ancient Greek Hipponax of Ephesus: "The two days in a woman's
life a man can best enjoy are when he marries her and when he carries
her dead body to the grave. "^15^ In the misogyny of the future---in the
coming gynocide---he will have one day he can best enjoy: "when he
carries her dead body to the grave. " We come after, as George Steiner
wrote; and we are women. We know what men can do.]{.sgc-5}

[Feminism is a much-hated political philosophy. This is true all along
the male-defined, recognizable political spectrum from far Right to far
Left. Feminism is hated because women are hated. Antifeminism is a
direct expression of misogyny; it is the political defense of woman
hating. This is because feminism is the liberation movement of women.
Antifeminism, in any of its political colorations, holds that the social
and sexual condition of women essentially (one way or another) embodies
the nature of women, that the way women are treated in sex and in
society is congruent with what women are, that the fundamental
relationship between men and women---in sex, in reproduction, in social
hierarchy---is both necessary and inevitable. Antifeminism defends the
conviction that the male abuse of women, especially in sex, has an
implicit logic, one that no program of social justice can or should
eliminate; that because the male use of women originates in the distinct
and opposite natures of each which converge in what is called "sex, "
women are not abused when used as women---but merely used for what they
are by men as men. It is admitted that there are excesses of male
sadism---committed by deranged individuals, for instance---but in
general the massive degradation of women is not seen to violate the
nature of women as such. For instance, a man's nature would be violated
if anyone forcibly penetrated his body. A woman's nature is not violated
by the same event, even though she may have been hurt. A man's nature
would not provoke anyone to forcibly penetrate his body. A woman's
nature does provoke such penetration---and even injury is no proof that
she did not want the penetration or even the injury itself, since it is
her nature as a woman to desire being forcibly penetrated and forcibly
hurt. Conservatively estimated, in the United States a woman is raped
every three minutes, and in each and every rape the woman's nature is at
issue first and foremost, not the man's act. Certainly there is no
social or legal recognition that rape is an act of political
terrorism.]{.font3}

[Antifeminism can accommodate reform: a recognition that some forms of
discrimination against women are unfair to women or that some kinds of
injustice to women are not warranted (or entirely warranted) by the
nature of women. But underneath the apparent civility, there are facile,
arrogant assumptions: that the remedies are easy, the problems
frivolous; that the harm done to women is not substantial nor is it
significant in any real way; and that the subordination of women to men
is not in and of itself an egregious wrong. This assessment is
maintained in the face of proved atrocities and the obvious
intractability of the oppression.]{.font3}

[Antifeminism is always an expression of hating women: it is way past
time to say so, to make the equation, to insist on its truth.
Antifeminism throws women to the wolves; it says "later"
or ]{.font3}["never" to those suffering cruel and systematic
deprivations of liberty; it tells women that when their lives are at
stake, there is no urgency toward either justice or decency; it scolds
women for wanting freedom. It is right to see woman hating, sex hatred,
passionate contempt, in every effort to subvert or stop an improvement
in the status of women on any front, whether radical or reform. It is
right to see contempt for women in any effort to subvert or stop any
move on the part of women toward economic or sexual independence, toward
civil or legal equality, toward self-determination. Antifeminism is the
politics of contempt for women as a class. This is true when the
antifeminism is expressed in opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment or
to the right to abortion on demand or to procedures against sexual
harassment or to shelters for battered women or to reforms in rape laws.
This is true whether the opposition is from the Heritage Foundation, the
Moral Majority, the Eagle Forum, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
Communist Party, the Democrats, or the Republicans. The same
antifeminist contempt for women is expressed in resistance to
affirmative action or in defenses of pornography or in the acceptance of
prostitution as an institution of female sex labor. If one sees that
women are being systematically exploited and abused, then the defense of
anything, the acceptance of anything, that promotes or continues that
exploitation or abuse expresses a hatred of women, a contempt for their
freedom and dignity; and an effort to impede legislative, social, or
economic initiatives that would improve the status of women, however
radical or reformist those measures are, is an expression of that same
contempt. One simply cannot be both for and against the exploitation of
women: for it when it brings pleasure, against it in the abstract; for
it when it brings profit, against it in principle; for it when no one is
looking, against it when someone who might notice is around. If one sees
how exploited women are---the systematic nature of the exploitation, the
sexual base of the exploitation---then there is no political or ethical
justification for doing one whit less than everything--- using every
resource---to stop that exploitation. Antifeminism has been the cover
for outright bigotry and it has been the vehicle of outright bigotry.
Antifeminism has been a credible cover and an effective vehicle because
the hatred of women is not politically anathema on either the Right or
the Left. Antifeminism is manifest wherever the subordination of women
is actively perpetuated or enhanced or defended or passively accepted,
because the devaluation of women is implicit in all these stances. Woman
hating and antifeminism, however aggressive or restrained the
expression, are empirical synonyms, inseparable, often
indistinguishable, often interchangeable; and any acceptance of the
exploitation of women in any area, for any reason, in any style, is
both, means both, and promotes both.]{.sgc-7}

[Antifeminism breaks down into contempt for particular kinds of
women---as men envision the kinds of women there are. There is a
spectrum of insult. Lesbians, intellectuals, and uppity women are hated
for their presumption, their arrogance, their masculine ambition.
Prudes, spinsters, and celibates may not want to be like men but they
seem able to live without them; so they are treated with contempt and
disdain. Sluts, "nymphos, " and tarts are hated because they are cheap,
not expensive, and because they are their sex raw or sex itself. These
epithets (often in ruder form) directed against a woman are intended to
malign her own relationship to her own gender or to sexuality as men
define and enforce it. The epithets are situational: chosen and applied
not to show what she is in her essential self but to intimidate her in a
particular situation. For instance, if she does not want sex, she may be
called a prude or a dyke, and after she has had sex, she may be
called---by the very same observer---a slut. Expressing ideas a man does
not like, she may be a slut or a dyke or a prude---depending on how any
given man assesses her vulnerability to insult or depending on the man's
own obsessional interest in prudes or sluts or dykes. Antifeminism is in
the reduction of a woman to perceptions of her sexuality or relation to
men or male sexuality; and antifeminism is in the ascribing of a
specific masculine integrity to acts usually reserved for men---acts
like making love with women or writing books or walking down the street
without apology or speaking with authority. Ideas and acts uphold the
potency and cultural vigor of these epithets, which reflect real
values---how women are disdained, why, what women do wrong and get
punished for. The breaking down of women into the insults used to
describe women, the use of these insults to describe or intimidate or
discredit, granting validity to these critiques of a female's posture,
pose, stance, attitude, or act, are all expressions of both antifeminism
and woman hating. When a woman expresses an opinion---about
anything---and the response is to undermine perceptions of or question
her sexuality, sexual identity, femininity, relations with men, the
response can be identified without further analysis as implicitly
antifeminist and woman-hating. It can and should be exposed as such.
Antifeminism as a strategy for subverting what credibility women can
muster runs the gamut from subtle innuendoes to overt hostility, all of
which is designed to remind the woman herself and those listening to her
that she is, after all, only a woman---and a defective one at that. The
woman hating implicit in the antifeminism is designed to humiliate the
woman so that she feels the humiliation and so that those listening can
see her being humiliated and feeling it. Raising and manipulating
antagonistic feelings toward a woman because she is a woman, using her
sex and sexuality, reminding her and those around her of what
she]{.font3} [is]{.font3} [and what she]{.font3} [is for]{.font3}[, are
the same as raising and manipulating racist antagonisms against a black
in a white-supremacist context. The response to the underlining of her
sex so as to impugn her credibility should not rest on whether or not
one agrees with the woman about whatever issue; the response should be a
response to the antifeminism and misogyny being used against her. It is
way past time to recognize, to say, to confront, the fact that women are
isolated and destroyed by the ways in which epithets discredit them. The
epithets are symbolic reminders of what she is reduced to, not human,
woman, that lower thing; the epithets are accusations that remind the
accused of her place as a woman and some alleged violation of its
boundaries. Women fear epithets because they are warnings, threats,
proof that a woman has made a wrong step in her relationship to the
world around her, proof that a man or men have noticed her and are angry
with her. Women fear these epithets because women fear the anger of men.
That anger is the substance of both antifeminism and misogyny. The
epithet is a weapon, whether hurled or delivered in a sulky or measured
tone. The epithet is inevitably an act of hostility used in a spirit of
vengeance. Calling a woman a name temporarily brands her; it molds
social perceptions of her in a way that upholds her social inferiority;
it frequently comes before the fist or before the fuck, and so women
learn to associate it with uses of themselves that they abhor, hostile
uses of themselves; and it frequently comes as he hits, as he fucks. The
epithet degrades a woman by degrading her sex, sexuality, and personal
integrity; it expresses a serious, not a frivolous, hatred---the hatred
of women, a serious hatred with serious consequences to those against
whom it is directed. Epithets as sex-based insults are like machine-gun
rounds, fired off, bringing down whatever gets hit---anything female
around. The hints of these sex-based insults, shadowed references to
them, evocations of them, are used with persistence and skill in the
public devaluing of women---in hating women and in the politics of
contempt for women, in common discourse and in cultural discourse. Every
time this use of a lexicon of hatred passes unremarked, every time the
hate is expressed and there is no visible rebellion, no discernible
resistance, some part of the woman to whom it happens dies and some part
of any woman who watches dies too. Each time the use of such an epithet
or its evocation passes without retaliation, something in women dies.
Each time slut, dyke, prude, is used to keep women intimidated and each
time its use is not repudiated (the repudiation cannot rest on whether
or not the accusation is in any sense accurate, only in its use),
antifeminism has stepped on another female life and crushed some part of
it; woman hating has humiliated and hurt another woman or a woman again.
Each time an honorable word---like lesbian---is used as a weapon of
insult, or some honorable act---like a woman having sex because she
wants to with a lover or lovers of her choice---is used as a weapon of
insult, or some honorable choice---like being celibate---is used as a
weapon of insult, the women who are and who do and who choose are
irrevocably hurt and diminished. The answer is not as simple as losing
one's fear of the words themselves (whether they apply or not), because
any woman would be a fool not to be afraid of what is behind the words.
Behind the words is the man who uses them and the power of his whole
class over the woman against whom they are used. Each time contempt is
expressed for the dyke, the prude, the slut, hatred is being expressed
toward all women. Whether the insults are accepted in society,
tolerated, encouraged, the main stuff of humor, or merely passively
acquiesced in, the devaluing of women is perpetuated, the intimidation
of women is furthered. Each time the insults are paraded or
whispered---used against a woman as insult---the insults gain in potency
from use, acceptance, and repetition; and any woman, however much she is
or is not what the insult conveys, is more liable to manipulation,
distortion, extortion, slander, and harassment; and antifeminism and
woman hating are that much more entrenched. Woman hating is the passion;
antifeminism is its ideological defense; in the sex-based insult passion
and ideology are united in an act of denigration and intimidation. The
tolerance for sex-based insult and its effectiveness in discrediting
women are measures of the virulence of antifeminism and woman hating:
how pervasive they are, how persuasive they are, how deeply rooted they
are, what chance women stand against them. In our society, sex-based
insult is the coin of the realm. Women live defensively, not just
against rape but against the language of the rapist---the language of
what a woman is called in intimacy and in public, loud and
soft.]{.font3}

[Antifeminism is also articulated through social models, of which there
are three of continuing major importance: the separate-but-equal model;
the woman-superior model; and the trusty, familiar male-dominant
model.]{.font3}

[The use of the separate-but-equal model is particularly cynical in the
United States, where that model applied to race was the foundation for
systematic racial segregation enforced by police power. Equality was
always a chimera or a lie; separation was real. The model held that
social institutions could be reasonably and fairly constructed on the
basis of biology, for instance, race or skin color. What made separation
necessary---the presumed inferiority of one of the biologically defined
groups---made equality impossible. The idea of separation and the
institutions of separation derived from a social inequality of such
astonishing magnitude and crass cruelty that separation in idea or
practice essentially denied that blacks had a human nature in common
with whites or any common human standing. The separate-but-equal model
itself originates in the conviction that men and women could not stand
on common human ground. The model originates in the effort to justify
the subordination of women to men (and in the justification to
perpetuate that subordination) by positing male and female natures so
biologically different as to require social separation, socially
antithetical paths, social life bifurcated by sex so that there are two
cultures, one male, one female, coexisting in the same society. The
separate-but-equal model applied to sex predated the variation of the
model applied to race. With respect to sex, the separate-but-equal model
held that women and men were destined by biology for different social
spheres. The spheres were separate but equal, which made the men and
women separate but equal. The sphere of the woman was the home; the
sphere of the man was the world. These were separate-but-equal domains.
The woman was supposed to bear and raise the children; the man was
supposed to impregnate her and support them. These were
separate-but-equal duties. The woman had female capacities---she was
intuitive, emotional, tender, charming (in women a capacity to arouse or
entrap, not an attribute). The man had male capacities---he was logical,
reasoning, strong, powerful (as a capacity and relative to the woman).
These were separate-but-equal capacities. The woman was supposed to do
domestic labor, the precise nature of which was determined by her
husband's social class. The man was supposed to labor in the world for
money, power, recognition, according to his social class. This was
separate-but-equal labor.]{.font3}

[Sex segregation in practice is necessarily different from race
segregation: women are everywhere, in almost every home, in most beds,
as intimate as it is possible to be with those who want to keep them
separate. Given the nearly universal intimacy women have with men, it is
astonishing to recognize how successful sex-segregation bolstered by the
separate-but-equal model has been and continues to be. Women have
invaded the male sphere of the marketplace, only to be segregated in
female job ghettos. In jobs, duties, responsibilities, physical, moral,
and intellectual capacities, division of labor within the home, the
ethic and practice that still obtains is sex segregation. The
separate-but-equal model applied to men and women continues to be
effective because it is seen to correspond to biology accurately and
fairly. The model has credibility because the sexual subordination of
women to men is seen to be in the nature of things and a logical premise
of social organization---a biological reality that is properly
reiterated in social institutions, civil prerogatives, and
sex-segregated obligations. The model is perceived as fair because in it
men and women are kept biologically separate (discrete), socially
separate (discrete), and they are declared equal because each is
doing]{.font3} [equally]{.font3} [what is appropriate to their sex.
Separation is seen to be the only real vehicle of equality for women.
The notion is that women competing with men, not limited to a female
sphere, could never achieve social or economic or sexual equality
because of their nature---which in all of these areas would simply be
inferior to male nature; females are inferior, however, only because
they have left the female sphere, which in itself is equal, not
inferior; females are only inferior to men in a male sphere, where they
do not belong. Equality is guaranteed by setting up separate spheres
according to sex and simply insisting that the spheres are equal. This
amounts to a kind of metaphysical paternalism: constructing a social
model in which women need not experience their inferiority as a burden
but instead are assigned such social value as women that their
inferiority is of equal social worth to the superiority of men. The
separate spheres are declared equal with no reference to the material
conditions of the persons in the spheres and this is the sense in which
women have equality with men under this model. There need not be
equality of rights, for instance; indeed, it is counterindicated. Since
the sexes are not the same, they should not be treated the same, and
something is wrong when a common standard is applied to both. In this
social model, separation by sex class is viewed as the only basis for
equality; sex segregation is the institutional expression of this
egalitarian ethic, its program in fact. With sex as with race,
separation is a fact; equality is a chimera or a lie.]{.font3}

[The woman-superior model of antifeminism is found in two apparently
opposing realms: the spiritual and the sexual. In the spiritual realm,
the woman is superior to the male by definition; he worships her because
she is good; her sex makes her moral or gives her the responsibility for
a morality that is sex-specific. Being female, she is higher, by nature
closer to some abstract conception of good. She is credited with a moral
sensibility that men are hard put to match (but then, they are not
expected to try): she is ethereal, she floats, her moral nature lifts
her up, she gravitates toward that which is pure, chaste, and tasteful.
She has an instinctive, sex-based knowledge of what is good and right.
Her moral sensibility is unfailingly benign, always an influence toward
the good. Her sex-class business includes the business of being
virtuous---a strange assignment by sex, since the Latin root of the
word]{.font3} [virtue]{.font3} [means "strength" or "manliness, " which
perhaps shows the futility of the project for her. This goodness of her
sex is essentially based on a presumed chastity, a necessary
chastity---of behavior but also of appetite. She, as a woman, is not
supposed to know sexual desire. Men lust. As one who by her nature does
not lust, she is the opposite of man: he is carnal; she is good. There
is no notion of female morality or of a woman's being good in the world
that is not based largely on chastity as a moral value. The great female
tragedies are stories of sexual falls. The tragic flaw in a female
hero--- Hardy's Tess or Tolstoy's Anna Karenina---is sexual desire. All
the drama of a female life, in great or in banal works, basically
replicates the biblical fall. Seduction (or rape) means knowledge, which
is sexual desire; sexual desire means descent into sin and inevitable
punishment. As a cultural symbol, the good female is innocent: innocent
of sex, innocent of knowledge---chaste in both ways. Historically,
ignorance has been a form of grace for the good woman; education was
denied women to keep them morally good. The elevation of a woman
requires that she have this innocence, this purity, this chastity: she
must not know the world, which men embody. The worship of a woman or a
female religious symbol is often the unmediated worship of chastity. The
virgin is the great religious symbol of female good, the female who is
by nature (in her body) good, who embodies the good. The awe and honor
accorded the chaste female by men are frequently pointed to to show that
men do not hate or degrade women, that men worship, adore, and admire
women. The morally superior nature of women is honored mostly in the
abstract, and women are worshiped mostly in the abstract. The worship is
worship of a symbol---a symbol manipulated to justify the uses to which
fallen women are put. The morally good woman is put on a pedestal---a
small, precarious, raised stage, often mined, on which she stands for as
long as she can---until she falls off or jumps or it goes boom.]{.font3}

[In the secular world, women are also credited with having a sense of
good that is intrinsically female, a sense of good that men do not have.
This is a frequent feature of contemporary environmentalist or
antimilitarist movements. Women are seen to have an inborn commitment to
both clean air and peace, a moral nature that abhors pollution and
murder. Being good or moral is viewed as a particular biological
capacity of women and as a result women are the natural guardians of
morality: a moral vanguard as it were. Organizers use this appeal to
women all the time. Motherhood is especially invoked as biological proof
that women have a special relationship to life, a special sensitivity to
its meaning, a special, intuitive knowledge of what is right. Any
political group can appropriate the special moral sensibility of women
to its own ends: most groups do, usually in place of offering
substantive relief to women with respect to sexism in the group itself.
Women all along the male-defined political spectrum give special
credence to this view of a female biological nature that is morally
good.]{.font3}

[However this premise about a biologically based morality is used, the
woman-superior model of antifeminism is operating to keep women down,
not up, in the crude world of actual human interchange. To stay
worshiped, the woman must stay a symbol and she must stay good. She
cannot become merely a human in the muck of life, morally flawed and
morally struggling, committing acts that have complex, difficult,
unpredictable consequences. She must not walk the same streets men do or
do the same things or have the same responsibilities. Precisely because
she is good, she is unfit to do the same things, unfit to make the same
decisions, unfit to resolve the same dilemmas, unfit to undertake the
same responsibilities, unfit to exercise the same rights. Her nature is
different---this time better but still absolutely different---and
therefore her role must be different. The worshiping attitude, the
spiritual elevation of women that men invoke whenever they suggest that
women are finer than they, proposes that women are what men can never
be: chaste, good. In fact men are what women can never be: real moral
agents, the bearers of real moral authority and responsibility. Women
are not kept from this moral agency by biology, but by a male social
system that puts women above or below simple human choice in morally
demanding situations. The spiritual superiority of women in this model
of ludicrous homage isolates women from the human acts that create
meaning, the human choices that create both ethics and history. It
separates women out from the chaos and triumph of human responsibility
by giving women a two-dimensional morality, a stagnant morality, one in
which what is right and good is predetermined, sex-deter-mined,
biologically determined. The worship of women, devotion to that in woman
which raises man, respect for some moral sensibility allegedly inborn
only in women, is the seductive antifeminism, the one that entrances
women who have seen through the other kinds. Being worshiped (for most
women) is preferable to being defiled, and being looked up to is better
than being walked on. It is hard for women to refuse the worship of what
otherwise is despised: being female. Woman's special moral nature has
sometimes been used to plead her case: being moral, she will be able to
upgrade the morality of the nation if she has the rights of citizenship,
the tone of the marketplace if she is employed, the quality of the
church if she officiates, the humanism of government if she is in it;
being moral, she will be on the side of good. It has also been argued,
more loudly and more often, that her moral nature must not be
contaminated by vulgar responsibilities; that she has a special moral
role to play in making the nation and the world good--- she must be in
her person the example of good that will civilize and educate men and
make the nation moral. One cannot do what men do---not in government,
not in the family, not even in religion, not anywhere---and be an
example of good. "It is the task of the Positive Woman, " wrote Phyllis
Schlafly, "to keep America good. "^1^ Women keep Amerika good by being
good. Many women who hate Schlafly's politics would agree that women
have a special moral responsibility "to keep America good. " They have a
different political program of good in mind and a different conception
of women's rights, but their conception of a biologically determined
morality in which women are better than men is not different.
Antifeminism allows for this sentimentality, encourages and exploits
this self-indulgence; liberation does not. As Frederick Douglass wrote
over a century ago: "We advocate women's rights, not because she is an
angel, but because she is a woman, having the same wants, and being
exposed to the same evils as man. "^2^ The woman-superior model of
antifeminism also takes a sexual form, one that is purely pornographic.
The central conceit of woman-hating sex, sex as conquest and possession,
dominance and submission, is that the woman has real power: she is only
the apparent victim; she is only seemingly powerless. Her power is in
her capacity to provoke erection or lust. Men suffer arousal
passively--- against their will or regardless of their will. They then
act on what a woman, or any sex object, has provoked. She provokes what
she wants. When a man has an erection and commits a sexual act because
of it or in response to it, he is acting in response to a provocation by
a woman, whose nature and intent are well met by his act. In
pornography, the male sexual values that inform and permeate rape and
other forced sex acts are articulated without apology. The genre insists
that sex is conquest, that the woman who resists wants to be forced,
hurt, brutalized; that the woman who wants sex gets pleasure from being
used like a thing, from pain and humiliation. The genre insists that
rape, battery, physical torture, bondage, capture, and imprisonment are
things done to women because women provoke them the same way that women
provoke erection: by being there, by being female. Provoking these acts
is the power women have over men; women get men to do these things, to
perform these sex acts. In the world men seem to exercise power, but all
of that comes to nothing in the face of the lust provoked by a woman.
Whatever he does to her, she is still more powerful than he is because
he wants her, he needs her, he is being driven by a desire for her. In
the sexual woman-superior model, power is articulated as being
intrinsically female because power is redefined beyond reason, beyond
coherence: as if power is in the corpse that draws the vultures. This
pornographic conception of female power is fundamental to the
antifeminism of sexual-liberation movements in which unlimited sexual
use of women by men is defined as freedom for both: she wants it; he
responds; voila! the revolution. It is also fundamental to the
antifeminism of the legal system with respect to sexual crimes like
rape, battery, and sexual abuse of children, especially girls. The
female is still seen as the provocation for what might be a legitimate
sex act, depending on just how provocative she was. Her will is regarded
as probably implicit in the use the male made of her. The female is seen
to have power over the man---and responsibility for what he has done to
her---because he wanted her so bad: she has provoked whatever desire
motivated him to act. His desire is what gives her power. Her power is
in her sexual nature, her existence as a woman to which he
responds---not in her behavior. For this reason, rape inquiries search
her behavior to find the truth about her nature. If her nature is
finally seen to warrant his act, he is not responsible for it---she is.
This is the power of women in pornographic sex. The apologies for this
sexual system that claim that women are powerful because women are
desired---in fact, that go so far as to insist that women are
sex-dominant and sex-controlling---uphold this phantasmagoric female
power, keeping women in real life powerless. The antifeminism is
directly implicit in the pornographic conceptions of female power,
female nature, and female freedom. Her power is in being used, her
nature is to be used, and her freedom is in being used. Or, her power is
in provoking men to hurt her, her nature is to provoke men to hurt her,
and her freedom is in provoking pain. Or, her power is in making men
force her to do what she does not want to do, her nature is to make men
force her to do what she does not want to do, and her freedom is in
being forced to do what she does not want to do. These principles of
antifeminism effectively confound both power and freedom: the response
in most women is to want neither. A woman's individual nature is more
than confounded: it is frequently annihilated.]{.font3}

[The male-dominant model of antifeminism is virtually everywhere. Its
woman-hating dimensions have been discussed brilliantly in many feminist
texts; here the focus will be on how it functions to stop a liberation
movement. Religion and biology are the great roots of the metaphysical
idea that men are superior to women because they are. Whether male
dominance is described as a kind of perpetual biological pillaging or
the will of a merely wrathful God, the hostility in male dominance is
what is most consistently justified by the idea of male dominance.
Keeping women a subject people is hostile. The genius of the
male-dominant model of antifeminism is the transmogrification of this
hostility into what passes for love. When one group conquers another,
the act of conquest is clearly hostile; when a man conquers a woman, it
is to express romantic or sexual love. Invasion is an act of hostility,
unless the male is invading the female, in which case "violation" is
used to mean love. Beating someone up is an act of hostility, unless a
man is beating a woman whom he loves: women, it is said, consider
beating proof of love and demand or provoke this proof. When a man
tyrannizes a people, he is hostile to their rights and freedom; when a
man tyrannizes a woman, he is well within the bounds of his role as
husband or lover. When a group deemed inferior is targeted for violence
in propaganda, that propaganda is unarguably hostile; when men target
women for sexual violence in pornography, the material, the targeting,
and the violence are considered expressions of sexual love. Mass
terrorization of one group by another is hostile, unless women are
terrorized by men raping, in which case each rape must be examined for
signs of love. Confining a group, restricting them, depriving them of
rights because they were born into one class and not another are hostile
acts, unless women are being confined, restricted, and deprived of
rights by the men who love them so that they will be what men can love.
There is hostility in the world, which one recognizes as historical and
social cruelty; and then there is the love of man for woman. The acts
may be the same but they are so very different, because what is done to
women is measured by an absolutely unique standard: is it sexy? Women
are taken to be sex, so if it---whatever it is---is done to a woman, it
is likely to be sexy. If it is sexy, it comes under the aegis of love.
Hostility is defined in the dictionary as "antagonism. " Love is seen to
be a grand antagonism; so is a great sexual passion, while the everyday
fucks are little antagonisms oft repeated. The torturer is just a real
obsessed lover when the victim is a woman, especially a woman whom he
knows intimately. Rape is just another kind of love; and nothing---no
law, no political movement, no higher consciousness---has yet made rape
less sexy for those who see love in male dominance. Chains are sexy when
women wear them, prisons are sexy when women are in them, pain is sexy
when women hurt, and love includes all this and more. Beat up a man for
speaking his mind and there is a human-rights violation---hunt him or
capture him or terrorize him and his human rights have been violated; do
the same to a woman and the violation is sexy. Nothing that falls within
the purview of the love of man for woman qualifies as a violation of
human rights; instead, violation becomes a synonym for sex, part of the
vocabulary of love. The love of the superior for the inferior must by
its nature be fairly horrific, fairly terrifying, grossly distorted.
When men love women, every hostile act demonstrates that love, every
brutality is a sign of it; and every complaint that a woman makes
against the hostility of male dominance is taken to be a complaint
against love, a refusal to be a real woman, that is, to suffer male
hostility as an ecstasy, to suffer love.]{.font3}

[The male-dominant model of antifeminism also proposes that freedom is
inimical to the situation of women because women must always bargain.
Since men are dominant, aggressive, controlling, powerful because of God
or nature, the weak women must always have something to trade to get the
protection of these strong men. Either the woman is too weak to care for
herself or she is too weak to fend off men; in either case, she needs a
male protector. If she needs a male protector, she must not only bargain
to get him; she must continuously bargain to keep him or to keep him
from abusing the power he has over her. This compromises any possibility
of self-determination for her. The dependence of women on men, the
inability of women to have and to manifest a self-sustaining and
self-determined integrity, and the fundamental definition of a woman as
a whore by nature are all established as being implicit in the
biological relationship between men and women: implicit and unalterable.
This feature of the male-dominant model is unique to it. Neither the
separate-but-equal model nor the woman-superior model puts women in a
metaphysically defined, biologically determined relationship of
prostitution to men. (Perhaps this virtue of the male-dominant model
accounts for its ubiquity. ) The bargain women must make because men are
biologically dominant is pointed to whenever a woman achieves. The
bargain is searched for---what did she sell to whom to enable her to do
whatever she did? The necessity for bargaining is used to stop
rebellion. The bargain necessitated by his greater aggression, strength,
and power is the principal reason for refuting the possibility of her
claim to independence in this model of antifeminism. He is dominant; she
must submit. Submission in the face of greater strength, greater
aggression, greater power, is unavoidable. She is simply not strong
enough to be on her own---especially not if he wants her because she is
not strong enough or aggressive enough to stop him from taking her. So
each woman has to make a deal with at least one of the strong ones for
protection; and the deal she makes, being based on her inferiority,
originating in it, acknowledges the truth and inevitability of that
inferiority. In needing to bargain because she is too weak not to, she
proves that antifeminism---the repudiation of her freedom---is grounded
in simple biological necessity, biological common sense, biological
realism.]{.font3}

[Because the male is presumed dominant by natural right or divine will,
he is supposed to have an exclusive authority in the realm of public
power. The antifeminism predicated on natural male dominance also
maintains that men naturally dominate government, politics, economics,
culture, state and military policy--- that men naturally assert their
dominance by running all social and political institutions. The token
woman here and there in no way interferes with the effectiveness of
virtually all-male clubs of power in erasing any hope of real authority
or influence for women. One woman on the Supreme Court, one woman in the
Senate, a woman prime minister, an occasional woman head of state, are
not so much role models as rebukes to economically demoralized women who
are supposed to accept the tokens as what they too could have been if
only they themselves had been different---better, smarter, richer,
prettier, not such schlemiels. Token women must go out of their way not
to offend the male sense of femininity, but by their visibility they
inevitably do so. As a result, the token women give out the correct line
on femininity and at the same time bear the brunt of the critical
perception that obviously they are not at home being fucked. The woman
who is not a token is mostly condescended to by the token, a
condescension that she feels not only acutely but often, since the token
is always pointed out to her as proof that her own situation does not
result from an exclusionary social system. Every all-male or nearly
all-male group---profession, institution, business, club, or power
clique---is a concrete embodiment of antifeminism. By its existence it
upholds and proclaims the dominance of men over women. By its existence
it reinforces the social inferiority of women to men, perpetuates the
political subordination of women to men, mandates the economic
dependence of women on men, and endlessly revitalizes the sexual
submission of women to men. The all-male clique of power communicates
the antifeminism of male dominance everywhere it operates, all the time,
without exception. The power of men to make decisions and determine
policy, to create culture and to control the institutions of culture, is
simultaneously held to be the logical outcome of male dominance and
proof of its existence. Every institution that is structurally
male-dominant is also ideologically male-dominant; or its structure
would change. Every group that is structurally male-dominant functions
as concrete resistance, material resistance, to the liberation of women:
it prohibits the exodus of women from the obligations and disadvantages,
not to mention the cruelties, of inferiority. Any area that is virtually
all male is hostile to women, to political rights, economic parity, and
sexual self-determination for women. The verbal support of men in
all-male institutions, groups, or cliques of power for mild feminist
reform has no value in the world of real, substantive change for women:
it is the all male structure itself that must be subverted and
destroyed. Male dominance and the antifeminism that defends it can only
be repudiated by being ended; those who construct it by literally being
the bricks of which it is built cannot change it by merely disputing it.
The antifeminism in exclusively male enclaves is not made humane through
gestures; it is immune to modification through diplomatic goodwill. As
long as a road is closed to women, it is closed to women; and that means
that women cannot take that road, however nicely the men on it suggest
they would not mind. The road is not only a road to power or
independence or equity; it is often the only road away from tremendous
abuse. The antifeminism in an all-male institution cannot be mitigated
by attitude; nor can male dominance---always the meaning of an all-male
enclave---ever accept that women are not inferior to men. The token
woman carries the stigma of inferiority with her, however much she tries
to dissociate herself from the other women of her sex class. In trying
to stay singular, not one of them, she grants the inferiority of her sex
class, an inferiority for which she is always compensating and from
which she is never free. If the inferiority were not reckoned
universally true, she of all women would not have to defend herself
against the stigma of it; nor would her own complicity in the
antifeminism of the institution (through dissociation with lesser women)
be a perpetual condition of her quasi acceptance. Male dominance in
society always means that out of public sight, in the private,
ahistorical world of men with women, men are sexually dominating women.
The antifeminism in the all-male rulership of society always means that
in the intimate world of men with women, men are politically suppressing
women.]{.font3}

[The three social models of antifeminism---the separate-but-equal model,
the woman-superior model, and the male-dominant model ---are not
inimical to one another. They mix and match with perfect ease, since
logic and consistency are not prerequisites for keeping women down: no
one need prove his case to justify the subordination of women; no one
need meet a rigorous standard of intellectual, political, or moral
accountability. Most people, whatever their political convictions, seem
to believe parts of each model, the pieces adding up to a whole view.
Fragmented philosophical and ideological justifications for the
subordination of women exist in a material context in which women are
subordinated to men: the subordination is self-justifying, since power
subordinates and power justifies; power both serves and consoles itself.
Separate-but-equal, woman-superior, and male-dominant antifeminism can
even be used sequentially as one whole argument for the practice of male
supremacy: men and women have different capacities and different areas
of responsibility according to sex but their functions and attributes
are of equal importance; women are morally superior to men (a different
capacity, a different area of responsibility), except when they provoke
lust, in which case they have real power over men; the biological
dominance of men over women is (a) counterbalanced by the real sexual
power of women over men (in which case each has separate-but-equal
powers) or (b) proved in that women are too good to be as aggressive and
as rudely dominant as men or (c) naturally fair and naturally reasonable
because natural submission is the natural complement to natural
dominance (and dominance and submission are separate-but-equal spheres,
submission marking the woman as morally superior unless the submission
is sexually provocative, in which case her sex gives her
different-but-equal power). Either this is true or it is not. Either the
arguments of antifeminism, one by one or the whole lot, are true or they
are not. Either there are separate-but-equal spheres or there are not.
Either women are morally better than men or they are not. Either women
have sexual power over men simply by being women or they do not; either
provoking lust is power t)r it is not. Either men are dominant by nature
or will of God or they are not. Antifeminism says all this is true;
feminism says it is not. The so-called feminism that says some of it is
true and some of it is not cannot combat antifeminism because it has
incorporated it. Antifeminism proposes two standards for rights and
responsibilities: two standards determined strictly by and applied
strictly to sex. Feminism as the liberation movement of women proposes
one absolute standard of human dignity, indivisible by sex. In this
sense, feminism does propose---as antifeminists accuse---that men and
women be treated the same. Feminism is a radical stance against double
standards in rights and responsibilities, and feminism is a
revolutionary advocacy of a single standard of human freedom.]{.font3}

[To achieve a single standard of human freedom and one absolute standard
of human dignity, the sex-class system has to be dismembered. The reason
is pragmatic, not philosophical: nothing less will work. However much
everyone wants to do less, less will not free women. Liberal men and
women ask, Why can't we just be ourselves, all human beings, begin now
and not dwell in past injustices, wouldn't that subvert the sex-class
system, change it from the inside out? The answer is no. The sex-class
system has a structure; it has deep roots in religion and culture; it is
fundamental to the economy; sexuality is its creature; to be "just human
beings" in it, women have to hide what happens to them as women because
they are women---happenings like forced sex and forced reproduction,
happenings that continue as long as the sex-class system operates. The
liberation of women requires facing the real condition of women in order
to change it. "We're all just people" is a stance that prohibits
recognition of the systematic cruelties visited on women because of sex
oppression.]{.font3}

[Feminism as a liberation movement, then, demands a revolutionary single
standard of what humans have a right to, and also demands that the
current sexual bifurcation of rights never be let out of sight.
Antifeminism does the opposite: it insists that there is a double
standard of what humans have a right to---a male standard and a female
standard; and it insists at the same time that we are all just human
beings, right now, as things stand, within this sex-class system, so
that no special attention should be paid to social phenomena on account
of sex. With respect to rape, for instance, the feminist starts out with
a single standard of freedom and dignity: everyone, women as well as
men, should have a right to the integrity of their own body. Feminists
then focus on and analyze the sex-class reality of rape: men rape, women
are raped; even in those statistically rare cases where boys or men are
raped, men are the rapists. Antifeminists start out with a double
standard: men conquer, possess, dominate, men take women; women are
conquered, possessed, dominated, and taken. Antifeminists then insist
that rape is a crime like any other, like mugging or homicide or
burglary: they deny its sex-specific, sex-class nature and the political
meaning undeniably implicit in the sexual construction of the crime.
Feminists are accused of denying the common humanity of men and women
because feminists refuse to fudge on the sex issue of who does what to
whom, how often, and why. Antifeminists refuse to acknowledge that the
sex-class system repudiates the humanity of women by keeping women
systematically subject to exploitation and violence as a condition of
sex. In analyzing the sex-class system, feminists are accused of
inventing or perpetuating it. Calling attention to it, we are told,
insults women by suggesting that they are victims (stupid enough to
allow themselves to be victimized). Feminists are accused of being the
agents of degradation by postulating that such degradation exists. This
is a little like considering abolitionists responsible for slavery, but
all is fair when love is war. In ignoring the political significance of
the sex-class system except to defend it when it is under attack,
antifeminists suggest that "we're all in this together, " all us human
beings, different-but-together, a formulation that depends on lack of
clarity for its persuasiveness. Indisputably, we're all in rape
together, some of us to great disadvantage. Feminism especially requires
a rigorous analysis of sex class, one that is ongoing, stubborn,
persistent, unsentimental, disciplined, not placated by fatuous
invocations of a common humanity that in fact the sex-class system
itself suppresses. The sex-class system cannot be undone when those whom
it exploits and humiliates are unable to face it for what it is, for
what it takes from them, for what it does to them. Feminism requires
precisely what misogyny destroys in women: unimpeachable bravery in
confronting male power. Despite the impossibility of it, there is such
bravery: there are such women, in some periods millions upon millions of
them. If male supremacy survives every effort of women to overthrow it,
it will not be because of biology or God; nor will it be because of the
force and power of men per se. It will be because the will to liberation
was contaminated, undermined, rendered ineffectual and meaningless, by
antifeminism: by specious concepts of equality based on an evasion of
what the sex-class system really is. The refusal to recognize the
intrinsic despotism of the sex-class system means that that despotism is
inevitably incorporated into reform models of that same system: in this,
antifeminism triumphs over the will to liberation. The refusal to
recognize the unique abuses inherent in sex labor (treating sex labor as
if it were sex-neutral, as if it were not intrinsically part of sex
oppression and inseparable from it) is a function of antifeminism; the
acceptance of sex labor as appropriate labor for women marks the triumph
of antifeminism over the will to liberation. The sentimental acceptance
of a double standard of human rights, responsibilities, and freedom is
also the triumph of antifeminism over the will to liberation; no sexual
dichotomy is compatible with real liberation. And, most important, the
refusal to demand (with no compromise being possible) one absolute
standard of human dignity is the greatest triumph of antifeminism over
the will to liberation. Without that one absolute standard, liberation
is mush; feminism is frivolous and utterly self-indulgent. Without that
one absolute standard as the keystone of revolutionary justice, feminism
has no claim to being a liberation movement; it has no revolutionary
stance, goal, or potential; it has no basis for a radical reconstruction
of society; it has no criteria for action or organization; it has no
moral necessity; it has no inescapable claim on the conscience of
"mankind"; it has no philosophical seriousness; it has no authentic
stature as a human-rights movement; it has nothing to teach. Also,
without that one absolute standard, feminism has no chance whatsoever of
actually liberating women or destroying the sex-class system. Refusing
to base itself on a principle of universal human dignity, or
compromising, retreating from that principle, feminism becomes that
which exists to stop it: antifeminism. No liberation movement can accept
the degradation of those whom it seeks to liberate by accepting a
different definition of dignity for them and stay a movement for their
freedom at the same time. (Apologists for pornography: take note. ) A
universal standard of human dignity is the only principle that
completely repudiates sex-class exploitation and also propels all of us
into a future where the fundamental political question is the quality of
life for all human beings. Are women being subordinated to men? There is
insufficient dignity in that. Are men being prostituted too? What is
human dignity?]{.font3}

[Two elements constitute the discipline of feminism: political,
ideological, and strategic confrontation with the sex-class system---
with sex hierarchy and sex segregation---and a single standard of human
dignity. Abandon either element and the sex-class system is
unbreachable, indestructible; feminism loses its rigor, the toughness of
its visionary heart; women get swallowed up not only by misogyny but
also by antifeminism---facile excuses for exploiting women, metaphysical
justifications for abusing women, and shoddy apologies for ignoring the
political imperatives of women.]{.font3}

[One other discipline is essential both to the practice of feminism and
to its theoretical integrity: the firm, unsentimental, continuous
recognition that women are a class having a common condition. This is
not some psychological process of identification with women because
women are wonderful; nor is it the insupportable assertion that there
are no substantive, treacherous differences among women. This is not a
liberal mandate to ignore what is cruel, despicable, or stupid in women,
nor is it a mandate to ignore dangerous political ideas or allegiances
of women. This does not mean women first, women best, women only. It
does mean that the fate of every individual woman---no matter what her
politics, character, values, qualities---is tied to the fate of all
women whether she likes it or not. On one level, it means that every
woman's fate is tied to the fate of women she dislikes personally. On
another level, it means that every woman's fate is tied to the fate of
women whom she politically and morally abhors. For in]{.font3}[stance,
it means that rape jeopardizes communist and fascist women, liberal,
conservative, Democratic, or Republican women, racist women and black
women, Nazi women and Jewish women, homophobic women and homosexual
women. The crimes committed against women because they are women
articulate the condition of women. The eradication of these crimes, the
transformation of the condition of women, is the purpose of feminism:
which means that feminism requires a most rigorous definition of what
those crimes are so as to determine what that condition is. This
definition cannot be compromised by a selective representation of the
sex class based on sentimentality or wishful thinking. This definition
cannot exclude prudes or sluts or dykes or mothers or virgins because
one does not want to be associated with them. To be a feminist means
recognizing that one is associated with all women not as an act of
choice but as a matter of fact. The sex-class system creates the fact.
When that system is broken, there will be no such fact. Feminists do not
create this common condition by making alliances: feminists recognize
this common condition because it exists as an intrinsic part of sex
oppression. The fundamental knowledge that women are a class having a
common condition---that the fate of one woman is tied substantively to
the fate of all women---toughens feminist theory and practice. That
fundamental knowledge is an almost unbearable test of seriousness. There
is no real feminism that does not have at its heart the tempering
discipline of sex-class consciousness: knowing that women share a common
condition as a class, like it or not.]{.sgc-7}

[What is that common condition? Subordinate to men, sexually colonized
in a sexual system of dominance and submission, denied rights on the
basis of sex, historically chattel, generally considered biologically
inferior, confined to sex and reproduction: this is the general
description of the social environment in which all women live. But what
is the real map of that environment? Which crimes create the topography?

[women, a lateral view of the female bottom of sex hierarchy. Rape,
battery, economic exploitation, and reproductive exploitation are the
basic crimes committed against women in the sex-class system in which
they are devalued because they are women. The crimes are points on a
circle because it is a closed system, from nowhere to nowhere. These
specific crimes are each committed against huge percentages of the
female population at any given time. Rape, for instance, consists not
only of police-blotter rape but also marital rape, incestuous abuse of
girls, any sex that is coerced. Battery is estimated to have happened to
50 percent of married women in the United States alone. All housewives
are economically exploited; all working women are. Reproductive
exploitation includes forced pregnancy and forced sterilization. There
are few female lives not touched by one, two, or three of these crimes
and significantly determined by all of them. At the heart of the female
condition is pornography: it is the ideology that is the source of all
the rest; it truly defines what women are in this system---and how women
are treated issues from what women]{.font3} [are.]{.font3} [Pornography
is not a metaphor for what women are; it is what women are in theory and
in practice. Prostitution is the outer wall, symbolically the mirror
reflection of the pornography, metaphorically built out of brick,
concrete, stone, to keep women in---in the sex class. Prostitution is
the all-encompassing condition, the body trapped in barter, the body
imprisoned as commodity. With respect to the circle of crimes--- rape,
battery, reproductive exploitation, economic exploitation--- the crimes
can be placed anywhere in the circle in any order. They are the crimes
of the sex-class system against women; they are the crimes that keep
women women in an immovable system of sex hierarchy. They are crimes
committed against women as women. Economic exploitation is a specific of
women's condition; it is not a sex-neutral political category into which
the experience of women sometimes falls. Women are segregated in job
ghettos as women; the lower pay of women is systematic; the sale of sex
is a fundamental dimension of economic exploitation, whether in
prostitution, marriage, or in the marketplace; when women move in large
numbers into high-status jobs (male jobs), the jobs lose status (become
female jobs); doing the same or comparable jobs as men, women get paid
less. Economic exploitation is a key crime against women but it is not
the same economic exploitation that men experience. The construction of
causality among the crimes or even the establishment of sequentiality
(in which order the crimes appeared in history or prehistory) is
ultimately irrelevant. It does not matter whether rape came first and
caused the systematic economic degradation of women, or whether economic
exploitation created conditions in which the production of children got
the value it now has, or whether men batter because of jealousy over
women's reproductive capacity, or whether the etiology of rape is in the
superior physical strength of men to women discovered in acts of battery
that later became sanctioned and systematic. One can follow the circle
around in either direction (see drawing 2) and construct marvelous
theories of causality or sequentiality, most of which are plausible and
interesting; and one can try to prioritize the political importance of
the crimes. But what must matter now is the condition of women now:
these crimes are now its features, its characteristic events, its
experiential absolutes, its inescapable attacks on women as women. These
crimes are real, systematic, and define the condition of women. The
relationships between them do not matter so much as the fact that they
are facts: equal, essential, basic facts. Seen in this light,
prohibition against lesbianism, for instance, is not the same kind of
equal, essential, basic fact, nor is lesbianism an obvious or sure road
to freedom. Lesbianism is a transgression of rules, an affront; but its
prohibition is not a basic constituent part of sex oppression and its
expression does not substantively breach or transform sex oppression.
There is no state of being or act of will, including lesbianism, that
changes the circle: there is no state of being or act of will that
protects a woman from]{.font3}

[the basic crimes against women as women or puts any woman outside the
possibility of suffering these crimes. Great wealth does not put a woman
outside the circle of crimes; neither does racial supremacy in a racist
social system or a good job or a terrific heterosexual relationship with
a wonderful man or the most liberated (by any standard) sex life or
living with women in a commune in a pasture. The circle of crimes is
also not changed by how one feels about it. One can decide to ignore it
or one can decide it does not apply for any number of reasons,
emotional, intellectual, or practical: nevertheless it is there and it
applies.]{.font3}

[Going back to the whole model---the circle, the pornography at the
center of it, the all-encompassing wall of prostitution that
circumscribes it---it does not matter whether prostitution is perceived
as the surface condition, with pornography hidden in the deepest
recesses of the psyche; or whether pornography is perceived as the
surface condition, with prostitution being its wider, more important,
hidden base, the largely unacknowledged sexual-economic necessity of
women. (See drawings 3 and 4. ) Each has to be understood as
intrinsically part of the condition of women---pornography being what
women are, prostitution being what women do, the circle of crimes being
what women are for. Rape, battery, economic exploitation, and
reproductive exploitation require pornography as female metaphysics so
as to be virtually self-justifying, virtually invisible abuses; and they
also require the wall of prostitution confining women (meaning that
whatever women do is within the bounds of prostitution) so that women
are always and absolutely accessible. The heart of pornography and the
wall of prostitution mirror each other in that both are meant to
mean---and concretely do mean in the male system---that women deserve
the crimes that define their condition, that those crimes are responses
to what women are and what women do, that the crimes committed against
women define the condition of women correctly---in accordance with what
women are and what women do.]{.font3}

[The meaning of this description of what women's subordination is, how
women are kept subordinate, how that subordination is acted out on women
systematically, is simple for feminists: breaking the circle up,
breaking down the wall, annihilating the system's heart, are what we
must do. The meaning for antifeminists is also simple: whatever
strengthens or vitalizes any aspect of the model is of great practical
value in keeping women subordinate. Antifeminists can disagree
strategically (for instance, on whether pornography should be public or
private) without disagreeing in principle on what is necessary to keep
women encapsulated in subjection (the use of pornography, its cultural
and psychic centrality whether it is public or private, the use of women
as pornography in public and in private). But one cannot be a feminist
and support any element in this model: there are no exceptions---not
civil liberties lawyers or liberals or sympathetic men or so-called
feminists who indulge in using the label but evading the substance.
Antifeminist politics come in many guises, but a vivid memory of what
the condition of women is---what crimes articulate it, what is at its
heart, what is the impenetrable boundary beyond which women do not
pass--- provides a standard for discerning antifeminism in any political
stance. No one can defend or give aid and comfort to that which keeps
women subordinate and at the same time claim to be acting in behalf of
women's liberation: feminism is not a lifestyle or an attitude or a
feeling of vague sympathy with women or an assertion of modernity.
Antifeminism saturates the political spectrum from Right to Left,
liberal to conservative, reactionary to progressive. Antifeminism is
resistance to the liberation of women from the sex-class system, that
resistance expressed in constructing political defenses of the
constituent parts of sex oppression. This antifeminism is a vital part
of programs, values, ideologies, philosophies, arguments, actions,
economic, sexual, and social manipulations that are the substance of
most political discourse and organizing. Antifeminism is a potent
expression of reaction, backlash, and suppression;]{.font3}

[Antifeminism is also operating whenever any political group is ready to
sacrifice one group of women, one faction, some women, some kinds of
women, to any element of sex-class oppression: to pornography, to rape,
to battery, to economic exploitation, to reproductive exploitation, to
prostitution. There are women all along the male-defined political
spectrum, including on both extreme ends of it, ready to sacrifice some
women, usually not themselves, to the brothels or to the farms. The
sacrifice is profoundly antifeminist; it is also profoundly immoral. Men
mostly accept the disposition of women under the sex-class system and
they mostly accept the crimes committed against women: but sometimes the
status of women is addressed, those crimes are addressed, in political
discourse. Whenever some women are doctrinally delivered to sex
exploitation, the political stance is corrupt. Virtually all ideologies
are implicitly antifeminist in that women are sacrificed to higher
goals: the higher goal of reproduction; the higher goal of pleasure; the
higher goal of a freedom antipathetic to the freedom of women; the
higher goal of better conditions for workers not women; the higher goal
of a new order that keeps the sex exploitation of women essentially
intact; the higher goal of an old order that considers the sex
exploitation of women a sign of social stability (woman's in her place,
all's right with the world). Some women are sacrificed to a
function---fucking, reproducing, house-cleaning, and so on. A political
promise is made, and kept, that some women will do some things so that
all women must not do all things. Women accept the sacrifice of other
women to that which they find repugnant: a seduction of antifeminism
that outdoes worship of female good in getting female adherents because
it is more practical. Men all along the political spectrum manipulate
this seduction with great skill. Some women are sacrificed by race or
class: kept doing some kinds of work that other women will then not have
to do. Supporting the use of]{.font3} [some]{.font3 .sgc-9} [women in
any area of sex exploitation is the willful sacrifice of women on an
altar of sex abuse and it is a political repudiation of the sex-class
consciousness basic to feminism: it is---whoever does it---antifeminism.

strategy:]{.font3} [some]{.font3 .sgc-9} [women, of course, like

[Now look at the world as right-wing women see it. They live in the same
world as all women: a world of sex segregation and sex hierarchy; a
world defined by the crimes of rape, battery, economic and reproductive
exploitation; a world circumscribed by prostitution; a world in which
they too are pornography. They see the system of sex oppression---about
which they are not stupid---as closed and unalterable. It is
unchangeable to them, whether they take as their authority God or man.
If sex oppression is real, absolute, unchanging, inevitable, then the
views of right-wing women are more logical than not. Marriage is
supposed to protect them from rape; being kept at home is supposed to
protect them from the castelike economic exploitation of the
marketplace; reproduction gives them what value and respect they have
and so they must increase the value of reproduction even if it means
increasing their ]{.font3}[own vulnerability to reproductive
exploitation (especially forced pregnancy); religious
marriage---traditional, correct, law-abiding marriage---is supposed to
protect against battery, since the wife is supposed to be cherished and
respected. The flaws in the logic are simple: the home is the most
dangerous place for a woman to be, the place she is most likely to be
murdered, raped, beaten, certainly the place where she is robbed of the
value of her labor. What right-wing women do to survive the sex-class
system does not mean that they will survive it: if they get killed, it
will most likely be at the hands of their husbands; if they get raped,
the rapists will most likely be their husbands or men who are friends or
acquaintances; if they get beaten, the batterer will most likely be
their husbands---perhaps 25 percent of those who are beaten will be
beaten during pregnancy; if they do not have any money of their own,
they are more vulnerable to abuse from their husbands, less able to
escape, less able to protect their children from incestuous assault; if
abortion becomes illegal, they will still have abortions and they are
likely to die or be maimed in great numbers; \* if they get addicted to
drugs, it will most likely be to prescription drugs prescribed by the
family doctor to keep the family intact; if they get poor---through
being abandoned by their husbands or through old age---they are likely
to be discarded, their usefulness being over. And right-wing women are
still pornography (as Marabel ]{.sgc-7}[Morgan recognized in]{.font3}
[The Total Woman)]{.font3} [just like other women whom they despise; and
what they do---just like other women---is barter. They too live inside
the wall of prostitution no matter how they see themselves.]{.font3}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\* ]{.font3}[Before 1973, both abortion and contraception were mostly
illegal. Perhaps two thirds of women aborting were married (in one good
study 75 percent were married) and most had children, as far as can be
discerned from the scanty evidence. With legal abortion and legal
contraception, about three quarters of the women seem to be single. As
many people suggest, women no longer feel compelled to marry on becoming
pregnant, which accounts in part for the demographic change. But I think
that the availability of contraceptives in conjunction with abortion is
mainly responsible for the lower percentage of married women among those
aborting. I suspect that married women use contraceptives with more
precision ]{.sgc-7}[and consistency than do single women---certainly
than do the teenagers who characteristically do not use contraceptives
at all and who skew the percentages toward single women. If the Human
Life Amendment or Statute passes, or any similar legislation, both the
intrauterine device and the low-dosage birth control pill will become
illegal. They will be considered abortifacients because they are known
to stop the fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall, thereby
"killing" it. If effective contraception is once again unavailable---so
that both contraception and abortion are inaccessible---I suspect the
percentage of married women having abortions will once again
skyrocket.]{.sgc-7}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[More than anything else, it is antifeminism that convinces right-wing
women that the system of sex segregation and sex hierarchy is immovable,
unbreachable, and inevitable---and therefore that the logic of their
world view is more substantive and compelling than any analysis, however
accurate, of its flaws. It is not the antifeminism of the Right
specifically that keeps the allegiance of these women: it is the
antifeminism that saturates political discourse all along the political
spectrum, the antifeminism that permeates virtually all political
philosophies, programs, and parties. Antifeminism is not a form of
political reaction and suppression confined to the far Right. If it
were, women would have compelling reason for moving away from the far
Right toward philosophies, programs, and parties not fundamentally
antifeminist; women would also have good reason to see sex-class
oppression as transformable, not absolute and eternal. It is the
pervasiveness of antifeminism, its ubiquity, that establishes for women
that they have no way out of the sex-class system. The antifeminism of
Left, Right, and center fixes the power of the Right over women---gives
the huge majority of women over to the Right---over to social
conservatism, economic conservatism, religious conservatism, over to
conforming to the dictates of authority and power, over to sexual
compliance, over to obedience---because as long as the sex-class system
is intact, huge numbers of women will believe that the Right offers them
the best deal: the highest reproductive value; the best protection
against sexual aggression; the best economic security as the economic
dependents of men who must provide; the most reliable protection against
battery; the most respect. Left and centrist philosophies, programs, and
parties tend to vicious condescension with respect to women's rights;
they lie, and right-wing women are quite brilliant at discerning the
hypocrisy of liberal support for women's rights. Right-wing women do not
buy the partial truths and cynical lies that constitute the positions of
various liberal and so-called radical groups on women's rights. They see
antifeminism, though they call it simple hypocrisy. They are outraged by
it.]{.font3}

[What is it that right-wing women see, then, when they look at
feminists? The Right, Left, and center have firm bases of power in that
they all come out of and serve and are led by the top class in the
sex-class system: men. They are all profoundly opposed to the
destruction of the sex-class system. Feminists want to destroy the
sex-class system but feminists come out of and serve and are led by the
bottom class in the sex-class system: women. The feminism of women
cannot match the power, the resources, the potency of the antifeminism
of the whole male political spectrum. Looking for a way out of the
sex-class system, a way beyond the boundary of prostitution, a way
around the crimes of rape, battery, economic exploitation, and
reproductive exploitation, a way out of being pornography, right-wing
women look at feminists and they see]{.font3} [women:]{.font3} [inside
the same boundary, victims of the same crimes, women who are
pornography. Their response to what they see is not a sense of
sisterhood or solidarity---it is a self-protective sense of repulsion.
The powerless are not quick to put their faith in the powerless. The
powerless need the powerful, especially in sex oppression because it is
inescapable, everywhere: there are no free zones, free countries,
underground railways away from it. Because feminism is a movement for
liberation of the powerless by the powerless in a closed system based on
their powerlessness, right-wing women judge it a futile movement.
Frequently they also judge it a malicious movement in that it
jeopardizes the bargains with power that they can make; feminism calls
into question for the men confronted by it the]{.font3}
[sincerity]{.font2 .sgc-1} [of women who conform without political
resistance. Since antifeminism is based in power (the sex-class power of
men along the whole political spectrum) and feminism is based in
powerlessness, antifeminism effectively turns feminism into a political
dead end. It is the antifeminism of Right, Left, center, and all
variations thereof, that makes the situation of women hopeless: there is
no hope of escape, no hope of freedom, no hope for an end to sex
oppression, because all power-based political parties, programs, and
philosophies abhor the liberation of women as a basis of action, as a
real goal, even as an idea. Being doomed by a reactionary political
stance to social subordination is not the same as being doomed by God or
nature to metaphysical inferiority---a crucial point---but it is still
real rough. The defenses of sex exploitation are simply too consistent,
too strong, too intensely felt, all along the political spectrum of
power-based discourse and organizing to be ignored by women who
recognize that they are women, not persons, as right-wing women do.
Simply put, the Right will continue to have the allegiance of most women
who see how real the sex-class system is, how intransigent it is, as
long as antifeminism is the heartfelt stance of those with other
political views, whatever the views. Those optimistic women who think
the antifeminism of the Left or center is somehow more humane than the
antifeminism of the Right will ally themselves as persons with whatever
groups or ideologies best reflect their own social or human ideals. They
will find without exception that the antifeminism they ignore is a
trenchant political defense of the woman hating they are victimized by.
Right-wing women, who are less queasy in facing the absolute nature of
male power over women, will not be swayed by the politics of women who
practice selective blindness with regard to male power. Right-wing women
are sure that the selective blindness of liberals and leftists
especially contributes to more violence, more humiliation, more
exploitation for women, often in the name of humanism and freedom (which
is why both words are dirty words to them).]{.font3}

[Facing the true nature of the sex-class system means ultimately that
one must destroy that system or accommodate to it. Facing the true
nature of male power over women also means that one must destroy that
power or accommodate to it. Feminists, from a base of powerlessness,
want to destroy that power; right-wing women, from a base of
powerlessness, the same base, accommodate to that power because quite
simply they see no way out from under. Those with power will not help;
those who are powerless like themselves arguably cannot. Feminists,
after the defeat of previous movements throughout history and facing
some kind of disintegration again (with the defeat of the Equal Rights
Amendment in the United States, the possible enactment of the Family
Protection Act, the Human Life Amendment or Statute, and other social,
political, and legal initiatives promoting female
subordination[ \*]{.sgc-10}), have to face the real questions. Can a
political movement rooted in a closed system of subordination---with no
political support among power-based political movements---break that
closed system apart? Or will the antifeminism of those whose politics
are rooted in sex-class power and privilege always destroy movements for
the liberation of women? Is there a way to subvert the antifeminism of
power-based political programs or parties---or is the pleasure and
profit in the subordination of women simply too overwhelming,]{.font3}

[\* ]{.sgc-11}[Feminists all over the world report similar
backlash.]{.sgc-7}

[too great, too marvelous, to allow for anything but the political
defense of that subordination (antifeminism)? Will it take a hundred
fists, a thousand fists, a million fists, pushed through that circle of
crime to destroy it, or are right-wing women essentially right that it
is indestructible? Can the wall of prostitution be scaled? Can what is
at the heart of sex oppression---the use of women as pornography,
pornography as what women]{.font3} [are]{.font2 .sgc-1}[---be stopped?
If antifeminism triumphs over the liberation movement of women---now,
again, always---whoever has political power or represents social order
or exercises authoritarian rule---whatever they are called, whatever
they call their political line---has women for good; the Right, broadly
construed, has women for good. Stasis and cruelty will have triumphed
over freedom. The freedom of women from sex oppression either matters or
it does not; it is either essential or it is not. Decide one more
time.]{.font3}
